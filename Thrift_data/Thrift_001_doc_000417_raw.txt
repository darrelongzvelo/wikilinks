IQT “Solutions”: Company Closures, Workers’ Rights, and the State of the Canadian
Labour Movement

How does it feel to arrive at work one day to find the doors locked permanently? Most of us can
imagine how cataclysmic an event this would be; unfortunately, 1200 more workers had to
experience this recently, as IQT Solutions closed its doors in Canada . Claiming bankruptcy
(no official filing could be immediately located), the call centre abruptly terminated
workers, trampling rights under the provincial Employment Standards ActÂ  to notice,
severance and vacation pay, refusing to even honour monies owed for hours worked. The company
had plans toÂ establish a new operation in Nashville, but the cityâ€™s mayor
withdrew the 1.6 million dollars that IQT was to be given in exchange for 900 jobs in the city
once he learnt of the havoc the company had wreaked upon Canadian workers.

Workers were undoubtedly shocked . Having been unorganized, mounting a challenge to this
proved difficult, albeit not insurmountable. In Oshawa,Â where approximatelyÂ 600
IQT jobs were lost, a long history of workersâ€™ activism, linked to thousands of other
communities,Â has shaped and supportedÂ local, provincial and national
organizations of labour to safeguard the rights of working people. This history, and the
forms of labour organization it has spawned, both help and hinder us as we face an increasingly
common problem inÂ many cities and towns â€“ company closures.

Local activists, along with supporters from the Durham Region Labour Council , the Canadian
Auto Workers , the Ontario Federation of Labour and the Ontario New Democratic Party were
quick to offer support and organizational aid to former IQT workers. However, the extent of
support that could be offered to these newly unemployed workers is also limited by the nature
and shape of the trade union movement as it has developed in the twentieth century.

Efforts to broadly organize workers predate the 1930s, with the Knights of Labor , the
Industrial Workers of the World and the One Big Union being particularly noteworthy
examples. With the mass unemployment of the Depression era came renewed efforts to organize
the unemployed. However, industrial unionism , which would go on to form the backbone of the
North American trade union movement, emerged from the 1930s as the dominant form of worker
organization.Â A 1937 strike in Oshawa which established the United Automobile Workers
in Canada is one early example of this.

Industrial unionism was a radical form of organizing at the time; whereas most workers prior
to this had been organized inÂ separateÂ locals by skill or trade, industrial unionism
brought all workers at the same company under the same union banner. High employment levels
during the Second World War and well into the postwar period, along with the expulsion of
â€œradicalsâ€� from the trade union movement early in the Cold War era, further
solidified this form of organization, limiting the space for dissent against the postwar
status quo. Organizing by workplace has since become the most typical form of unionism, and
has laid the basis for labour organizations and labourÂ laws in Canada.

The foundation of this system of organization first trembled in Canada in the 1970s, when
Dunlop Tire closed its Toronto factory. Worker protest led to changes to the Employment
Standards Act and Canadian Labour Code, requiring employers in Ontarioto provide advance
notice of mass terminations and severance pay. In 1980, the Houdaille Bumper plant in Oshawa
closed its doors, leading workers there to occupy the plant for two weeks. Their actions
brought important changes to the Employment Standards Act, encouraging pension
portability and ensuring benefit payments were made through the pre-notification period
that companies were required to give when closing.

These gains were overall quite limited. Workers still lost their jobs, and often, their
active union membership – there is little space for the unemployed within the current trade
union movement. Meanwhile, company closures have become increasingly common in current
decades, as the political and economic landscape has shifted to give companies greater
flexibility to operate globally.

Yet the labour movement continues to operate largely along the lines established in the 1930s
and 1940s, on a system premised on high employment levels and national protectionism . IQT
workers have shown us that when pushed far enough, workers can and will self-organize to
protect their rights. The labour movement can and has been an important ally to this, offering
aid and support in organizing rallies, protests and actionsÂ where affected people,
unionized or not, can express their voice and demand a fair deal.

At the same time, terminated workers, unionized or not, are excluded from full participation
in the labour movement. If they find another job, and if it is a non-unionized workplace, if
they are able to convince half of the people at their new workplace to unionize, then they will
be welcome to fully participate in the labour movement.

Unionization rates in North America have been steadily declining in recent years, along with
the job security, benefits and good pay that organized workers haveÂ won. IQT is a
reflection of this, whereby Bell Canada has contracted out what were once unionized jobs to a
non-unionized third party employer. This process is also linked to the growing ascendancy of
global capital in the late twentieth century in the fertile soil of neoconservative
governance, and the ability of products and services (but not people) to travel freely across
national borders.

The times they are a-changin. The actions of IQT serves as another reminder that perhaps
itâ€™s time for the labour movement to change along with them, to re-imagine the ways
that working people can belong and participate in a larger organization of working people.
Alternate models may largely defy living memory in North America, but they are a part of our
global history, there to learn from and help us inform future directions, if we are willing to
look back far enough. No one system of organization has been perfectly successful, but there
is as much to be learnt from past failures and successes which can help us to build a new, strong,
successful and more inclusiveÂ movement.

Until we open ourselves to different models, recent history and current conditions suggest
that we will remain largely powerless in the wake of the antics of companies like IQT
Solutions, and as is all too often the case, it will be workers paying the price.
