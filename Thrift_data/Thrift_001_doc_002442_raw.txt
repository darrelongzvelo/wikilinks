It is any emerging designerâ€™s dream to have their label discovered by an exclusive
boutique and to be chosen for the runway in an elite fashion event.

For Shae Fleming, owner of the brand 2Shae, both happened within a week.

The hard work involved in starting her own label were well worth the effort after being invited
to be part of Melbourne Fashion Week as an interstate guest label days after her first
collection debuted in the upmarket Paddington boutique, Social Royalty.

Shoppers on Oxford St, including myself, were treated to a surprise on Saturday 25 th June, as a
team of beautiful models strutted the street towards the boutique wearing 2Shaeâ€™s
Australian-designed, sourced and manufactured styles. We all know how much I love
Australian products!

More than 200 people attended the in-store launch and reveled in the delightful Torbreck
wines, which gave that luxurious ‘champagne shoppingâ€™ experience, with a fashion
parade.

The 2Shae crew included 11 models, a professional hair and makeup team of 5, a video crew, 4
photographers, as well as 3 drivers. â€œIt was a huge team effort,â€� said Shae.
â€œI wanted to make a scene and make a scene we did.â€�

Shoppers were forced front row as models strutted the Gould Street shopping strip in Bondi
Beach in a guerrilla style parade before jumping into hot cars to take on Paddingtonâ€™s
Oxford Street.

After seeing first hand the success of the event, it came as no surprise to Dana Randall,
manager of Social Royalty, who said:

â€œThe designers we choose to stock are the most promising new talents around the world,
and we even have labels that have graced New York and Paris Fashion Week, exclusive to Social
Royalty in Australia. 2Shae is already proving a â€˜must-haveâ€™ for our style
savvy customers!â€�

Where do women go to stand out, be different and feel fabulous? Social Royalty Paddington



July 11th, 2011





Image: http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Trias.jpg

Paddington went through tough times when Westfield Bondi Junction opened. Stores closed
down and Paddington became a ghost town for retailers. But changes in the past few years has
seen the fashion mecca of Sydney bounce back and flourish. This is thanks to fresh new blood
pumping through the veins of Paddington – Social Royalty.

What makes Social Royalty so unique to Oxford Street are the brands which are exclusive to
Social Royalty in Australia and amounts per style are limited. Women who shop there can be one
of the very few to own a unique item.



Image: http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CC2.jpg

Walking into the store, you’re greeted by the very sweet Dana, who knows the products inside
out. The store feels glamourous, but with a warm feeling. The outfits are spaced out around the
walls of the store, looking more like an exhibition – they are presented beautifully
because they are beautiful.

Mid range to high end, including designers showing at New York and Paris Fashion Week. There
are even the most gorgeous bikinis I have ever seen, definately stop here for this summers
beach purchase!



Image: http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/agua.jpg

The next big names in fashion and accessories can be found here, and you can be one of the first to
have it! Watch out for: TRIAS, Carmelita Couture , Agua Bendita , Henry Hall Jeans and more,
which are all instore for you to try on and take home!

Recently, Social Royalty was pleased to welcome home grown brand, 2Shae – a new brand by
Bondi designer Shae Fleming.

All of the designers are hand-picked from around the world for their originality and talent
for design.



Image: http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CC.jpg

Aussie women are cluey about fashion and in the age of The Sartorialist , most women want their
own style rather than trawl through one chain store after another looking like everyone else
in mass produced pieces. Boutique shopping is what it’s all about and in Paddington you can
find all the best Australian designers stores as well as other fab boutiques.

Be sure to get there and walk out of there with a new outfit to slip into and turn heads.

Social Royalty – 310 Oxford Street, Paddington

Bondi Beach Cruisers – Not Just For Summer!



June 15th, 2011





Image:
http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Bondi-Beach-Cruisers-3.jpg

Just because it is now Winter, it doesn’t mean you can’t still enjoy the gorgeous sunshine
Sydney has to offer throughout the crispy season (once this rain goes away!).

Just imagine this.

A gorgeous Sunday, bright clear skies, the sun shining down over Bondi Beach, only the very
keen surfers out in the surf, cruising the streets with the crisp zephyr keeping you alert yet
enjoying every second of what the positive ions in the air of the beach-side suburb.

Ok I might sound like I’ve taken some drugs and am in some fantasy land. Well I haven’t taken
a thing.

You’re wondering why I said “cruising the streets”?

Well that’s because Bondi Beach Cruisers are the only way to get around Bondi (or anywhere
else you might live in our stunning country).

Hawaiian beach culture comes to Australia with the opening of Bondi Beach Cruisers, online
retailer of quality, stylish and affordable beach cruiser and lowrider bicycles.

Local couple, Resa Pratoni and Belinda Miller, driven by a love of vintage bicycles, launched
the brand earlier this year.

Renewed popularity of bicycles and green transportation along with a strong community focus
are the basis for this healthy living duo so expect to see them cruising around Bondi on the
three available styles: Men’s Southend Cruiser, Ladies Iceberg Cruiser & The TRex
Lowrider, all available online now or by pick-up in Bondi by prior arrangement.

I think these cruisers really capture the essence of what beach and Bondi lifestyle is all
about. We all have a little beach bum trapped inside of us somewhere, and even if you don’t
live anywhere near a beach, this is most certainly something you can ride with pride.

Rosemount Australian Fashion Week 2011 – Kirrily Johnston



May 9th, 2011



Image: http://img.youtube.com/vi/TlBmEaAu12U/0.jpg

The Kirrily Johnston SS 2011/12 show was held at one of Sydney’s most loved venues –
Icebergs at Bondi Beach. The venue alone said many things – this collection is not going to be
wasting our time.

Seating positioned around the every wall of Icebergs was sure to have everyone front row –
and of course our gift bags waiting too!

Around 250 people squeezed into the space which was completely repainted to suit the colours
from the neutral earthy toned collection, by main sponsor Dulux.

Many different textures, with inserts of various fabrics including leather and suede. In
terms of colour and “Wow” factor, the show was very safe, but the delicious caramels,
taupes and cinnamons delighted all.

But why don’t you be a judge and have a look for yourself. Check out the footage I took at the
show.

The Farm meets Bondi Beach – Bondi Farmers Market



April 14th, 2011





Image:
http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/From-Bush-to-Beach-small.jpg

As we all know, the famous Bondi Markets arenâ€™t just a treasure trove for fabulous
fashions, jewellery, homewares, exotic imports and arts and crafts, but soon they will also
be home to delicious farmers markets.

From Saturday April 30, Bondi locals will have beachside access to some of the freshest,
unique and gourmet produce available with the announcement that the Bondi Farmers Market
will operate every Saturday morning at the Bondi Beach Public School.

From the country to the coast, foodies can now indulge in handpicked produce and gourmet
delicacies, including seasonal fruit and vegetables, quality cheeses, olive oils, pasta,
sea food and wines direct from local farmers and fresh food makers.

Now that I spend so much time in Bondi co-hosting on Bondi 88 FM, I’m definately going to be a
supporter of our local Australian businesses who work endlessly to provide the best and
freshest.

Youâ€™ll find many stall holders with award winning produce and you will be able to
purchase delightful products like Alchemy Coffee, boutique market fruit & vegetables from
Johnsonâ€™s Farmgate, Farmer Jo indulgent muesli and dreamy gelato using organic
ingredients from Gelato Cart. Other unique delicacies include, A Taste of Bush native
Australian herbs and spices, Li-Sun exotic mushrooms, family farmed Mirrool Creek lamb
(which I absolutely love!) who supply some of Sydneyâ€™s finest restaurants, Over The
Moon Milk which is made the old fashioned way, pastas from Pastabilities and
Hamiltonâ€™s Bluff NSW wine.

â€œWith the growing demand from consumers wanting to know where their produce is coming
from and how and where they are grown, the new Bondi Farmers Market is the ideal occasion to
purchase direct from local producers.â€� said Mr Ross Alexander, Bondi Markets
Manager.

â€œIâ€™m sure that the Bondi Farmers Market will soon become a Saturday morning
shopping ritual, similar to our Sunday Bondi Markets, where locals can chat face-to-face
with growers and producers and become more informed about their food firsthand.â€�

What: Bondi Farmers Market featuring fresh seasonal produce from local NSW farming regions.

When: Every Saturday from 30 April, 9am to 1pm

Where: Acro ss the road from the beach at Bondi Beach Public School, Campbell Parade. Located
in the same place as the Sunday Markets.

The Stunning and Talented Countess Of Pop – Countess Emilia de Poret



March 16th, 2011





Image:
http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Emilia-de-Poret-Adrian-Erdedi-e1279458671356.png

When I first met Countess Emilia de Poret , I was in awe of her elegance, style and absolute
graciousness. She stood with me, Jennifer Hawkins and other stunning personalities, but it
was Emilia that stood tall, and stood out the most. She towers over everyone, and her ÃŒber
high-fashion was the envy of everyone there.

Approachable, socialable and easy to talk to, Emilia and I engaged in conversation that
night, and continued to do so each time we’ve seen eachother after that night.

More inclined to call her the Queen of Couture, Emilia has a wardrobe that is like nothing in
this world! It’s like she has the wardrobe of Sex and the City , but better!

The beautiful Swedish born blonde has a super successful singing career all over the World,
particularly in Europe. She has just released her great, funky and catchy new song called
“This Ain’t A Lovesong” from her album Pick Me Up . This comes after her amazingly
successful Worldwide dance track, “Pick Me Up”.

I’ve attached Emilia’s utterly astounding video clip for “This Ain’t A Love Song”
featuring Verbal from M-Flo , which is one of the best video’s I’ve seen in a long time! The
fashions throughout the clip are just divine! Shot in Japan, Emilia visits all the hottest
locations in Japan, wearing the most amazing outfits and literally towering over the locals
in sexy heels. She treads on dangerous grounds in the Shinjuku neighbourhood where the
Japanese Mafia could have taken their cameras at any time.

It brings me great pleasure to introduce you to the fabulous Countess Emilia de Poret…

What projects are you currently working on or have in the near future?

I am currently promoting my music in Australia, USA, Japan and Spain. I got a good start this
year in the US with Pick Me Up climbing the Billboard Dance Chart to # 25. This will be followed up
with a new single release in the US in the fall, promotion and touring.

I was chosen by Liberty of London www.liberty .co.uk to design a print that will be part of their
â€œLiberty Rocksâ€� collection out 2011. I made a print of multiplying microphone
heads. It was great to be part of such an amazing project combining music and fashion. It is also
a real honour to know that my print will be in Libertyâ€™s archive forever and maybe
picked up by some great fashion houseâ€Šstay tuned!

How did you get into doing what you do?

My grandmother used to look after me when I was a kid. She was a really good singer and a pianist
and used to practise with me on her lap. According to her I could sing before I could talk. Music
has always been the most natural thing to me. I could never live without it! Growing up I went to
music schools and took every chance to sing and perform.

What is your greatest extravagance?



I own far too many pair of shoes!











Signature dish?



Meatballs! I am Swedish after allâ€Š



When was the last time you cried?



When I friend of mine played me a really beautiful song in the studio the other day.

Is there a charity/cause that is close to you and if so, why?



I support ComitÃ© pela Vida , a Brazilian charity based in Rio which is helping kids and
teenagers to get an education.





You visit Sydney a fair bit, so where is your favourite place to relax when you are here?



A day on Bondi beach followed by dinner at North Bondi Italian is my ideal way of relaxing in
Sydney.



The one thing I canâ€™t leave home without isâ€Š

My phone, my music, my notebook, my Ksubi sunglasses, my rings (one on each finger), make up, my
special tea, my computer, Swedish LÃ€kerol etc etcâ€Š. I thank God every day for my
oversized Chanel handbag!

Where would be your ultimate holiday destination?



Brazil.

What is one success you are proud of and one failure you try to forget (or learnt from)?



I am so happy that I kept fighting when things didnâ€™t go the way I wanted to. Every
failure made me work harder and every success made me want to achieve even more.



Greatest lesson learnt?



Never, ever give up!

What is your favourite piece of clothing and accessory?



It is really impossible to choose only one but if I have to I would say a dress by Martin Margiela
Artisanal, covered in recycled vinyls. It is my favourite stage piece.

My favourite accessory is a ring by Garrard given to me by my husband. It is an Angel wing covered
in black diamonds.





Who or what influences you most in Fashion and home dÃ©cor?

I am very impressed by Phoebe Philo . I love what she has done so far for CÃ©line !

In home dÃ©cor I pick up a lot of influences from travelling, my home is a mix of Marie
Antoinette and Tokyo madness!

Which celebrity wardrobe would you love to raid and why?



Karl Lagerfeld for his many rings and Daphne Guinness for her wardrobe full of couture
(although it would never fit me).

What frustrates you most about Sydney when you are here?

That I never want to leave!

What is one quality you have, that you hope your children will get and carry through life?



I would love for my future children to be artistic in one way or another and devote their life to
something they really are passionate aboutâ€Šsaying that, I might get a child
whoâ€™s dream is to become an accountantâ€Šwell, that would be ok too.

The Sexy Designer With Looks To Kill – Tali Jatali



June 7th, 2010





Image:
http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Tali-Jatali-Adrian-Erdedi-3.png

She is a beautiful women, with exotic features and a unique accent. A successful model around
the world for brands like Chanel, and also a successful fashion designer specialising in
swimwear, Tali Jatali has made a big footprint in the world of Australian glamour and fashion
– especially for a beachside lifestyle.

A kind and gentle person, Tali appreciates the simple things in life like her family, gorgeous
young daughter Zsa Zsa and new Moodle puppy Verushka. Living a happy life, with the people you
love is what Tali is about. But there has to be more about Tali right? Read on to find out alot more
in my down to earth and relaxed interview with glamazon Tali Jatali…

What projects are you working on or have in the near future?

I’m working on my samples for Summer, so I can go to New York in August and instead of going on
just a holiday to see my best friend and publicist Matt Dillon, I will be going to shoot my range
as long as the samples are ready, which they should be. So I will be going for work and pleasure.

Who or what influences you most in fashion and home dÃ©cor?

The people that influence me the most in fashion are people on the street, watching people. I
don’t really watch fashions shows and copy that, I hate that.

At home, I’m not very good with interiors, so I constantly watch those home shows on Foxtel
where they do make-overs and 60 minute renovations.

What is your favourite piece of clothing or accessory?

All of my favourite clothes are all the things I make, including my swimwear, but because I’m
not a big brand person, like I don’t care about things like having to wear Chanel, I’m not
really like that. But I like alot of vintage stuff and wear alot of vintage accessories and the
only brand I really like to wear that is Australian is Sass & Bide, Alice McCall and girls like
that, I’ll wear their stuff.

The girls aren’t just artistic and clever, they have got it together mentally and thats why
their business is successful, not just because OH WOW, they have a good idea – anyone can have
a good idea but it doesn’t necessarily mean you can pull it off and carry it on for ages. You
might be able to do a few things for a minute, but then you’re finished. The longevity of it is
really important.

What is a feature of your home you love most?

YES YES YES!! Ages ago my friend painted a feature wall in my apartment in black, because the
rest of the apartment is white. Just recently my kid Zsa Zsa was bored, so I told her to just go and
draw on the black wall. It’s amazing, I now have this big black wall full of kid’s drawings
– it’s awesome, it’s very cool! I thought I would just let her have fun and if it looks bad,
just paint over it. I don’t care about things like that, I just want to have a good life and not
worry about little things.

What is your greatest extravagance?

PROPERTY DARLING! It’s property darling!!! Always! I’m a good girl. I’m not into shoes
and shit. When people see me out and what I really am are two different things. Because my
biggest love and biggest worry is my kid. Otherwise, I’m a strong business person and really
together, but when I go out, I get really excited and always misbehave!

[As the interview takes place, we have a good laugh - Verushka decides it's time to "pee pee" on
her newspaper, and begins to smell it. "Verushka is not very lady-like"]

What advice would you give someone if they were thinking of going into the fashion industry?

Definately only do it if you love it, because if you don’t love it, you will fail.

If you love it, no matter what it is that you choose, even if it’s hard to get there, the journey
will be fun because you have so much passion.

Also, anyone that is young, definately go to design school. It’s tough for people who start
at maybe 30 or 35 and have not gone to design school because they may not be good at sitting at
school for 5 years, but at 18 or 20, you can go to Europe, do a year here and there. Just definately
study, whether it’s pattern making or whatever, you might not use all of it in the future,
it’s like learning another language, it’s always helpful even if you don’t always use
it.

So then how did you get into doing what you are doing?

Well I was a model for 15 years and I started my business at 32, and i didn’t go to design school
because I’m too old to sit there, but I knew from doing things like Chanel shows and traveling
for 15 years, and modeled for so many different brands. Jamie who owns One Teaspoon, she is my
house mate and we also formed Jatali together (Ja + Tali = Jatali), she actually new how to make
clothes and cut patterns and stuff, she helped me.

The rest of my work I give it out, I have a cutter, pattern maker, I just do all of the fabric
sourcing which I don’t want to share with anybody. There’s lots of thieves out there and I
don’t want my ideas stolen again. It’s not good.

What is something your mother or father always told you…

To get a real job. Get a real job that pays you proper money every week.

They are still like “Darling, are you alright? Have you got a job?”

Where is your favourite place to relax in Sydney?

Just at home, Bondi Beach. I never leave Bondi much. Everything is here.

How often do you cook and eat out?

I eat out all the time, and I try really really hard to cook for my baby. My cooking is really
average but I really do try. My dinners are quite hideous, I try to do meat because the kid likes
meat, but I definately take her out more/ The only thing I cook that she thinks is really good is
my scrambled eggs. I put cheese in it so she thinks it’s ok. The other day I made a bolognese
thing, which it was ok, but she said “Mama, let’s go for pizza darling”, so I then had to
buy pizza as well.

Australian fashion in comparison to International fashion?

Usually, until I went to fashion week this year, usually if you had asked me the question the
week before RAFW, I would have gone on and on about it, would have been so supportive and can I
help anybody… But when I went this year, a designer totally copied one of my favourite looks
I’ve been doing, I gt the shits so bad and I’m so over them all. I was so mad. Everyone that was
there knew I was mad and reported it because they know what I do. But the girls we have already
spoken about [Alice McCall and Sass & Bide] are very talented and very good, and there’s lots
of great new people, like the people who were too young a couple of years ago, are now old enough
to be taken seriously.

Gay boys are definately better designers then straight ones, they just are, and that’s a
fact. They are better hair and make-up artists too. In the whole fashion industry they are the
best.

What’s one thing you can’t leave home with out?

Oh my god, my KID!! Except for when she has school!

But seriously, my money… Lip gloss… I use that red Paw Paw cream stuff. I don’t really
like make-up. Oh and my phone and if I’m driving, my drivers license.

So living on Bondi Beach, would you say it’s your favourite beach?

It’s my favourite. Love it, love it, love it, love it. It’s the best!

Why?

You just live longer living at the beach. Fresh air, no car fumes, and even though where I live is
quite noisy, I like it because if it was quiet I would be really lonely. If Zsa Zsa gets bored,
we’ll go to the playground, or she will fluff around in the sand. She is 7 and she is such a good
baby. She is a good girl.

Where would your ultimate holiday destination be?

LOS ANGELES! I used to live there, but I also have family there. For me, going on a holiday
sitting on my ass getting a tan and getting skin cancer – I’m already bored. I like to go to LA
and go to some really amazing full-on hot parties with big celebs and having a couple of
Vodka’s and just having the best time. I like to buy things, and if you go to an island or
something like that, I get bored. I like LA because I can buy things like cool t-shirts and
unreal things for people we know.

What is the one quality you have that you’d like Zsa Zsa to take from you and carry through
life?

I’m really really straight-forward, honest and Â I don’t do wrong by people. I come
from an old fashioned Jewish Daddy and in some ways, I’m like my dad I don’t want her to work
as hard as me, because I will just give her everything.

What is a fashion trend you hope will never re-surface?

Ummmm… It would have to be those swimsuits that go straight up your legs, like the ones on
Moscow, Russia. They look like idiots with it cut up really high at the back. I’m not a fan of
people with fake boobs, so anything with that kind of style that shows them off is out of
fashion. I don’t mind shoulder pads and all that stuff, that’s good.

Sneakers on the red-carpet is not a good look for girls. They are for boys. Girls should look
pretty and edgy.

When was the last time you cried and why?

Today, because my boyfriend from when I was 25 who lives in Dubai called last night, and when I
heard his voice I asked what was wring with him and he said his father had died. So I had to go to a
funeral today and I’d never been to one before. It’s my first funeral. Caroline Byrne who
was pushed off the Gap was my best friend when we were young and I didn’t go to hers. I was scared
of going. So today was the first one. I also cry once a month before my periods, I always cry and I
never know what’s wrong with me and I’m like “oh deeer, no wonder I’m crying!”, oh
and sometimes I cry when my baby is asleep and she snores, because I can’t believe how
beautiful she is. She snores like a small donkey, she’s so cute!

If you were admired by millions of young people globally, what would be something you’d like
to be a role model of?

Drugs! I’m very anti-drugs and have never tried one in my life. Yuck. I don’t mind showing
them that being a party girl is fun, but I don’t mean taking drugs party girl. I mean go to
school, do well, get a job, still have a life, have fun and not be a lonely weirdo. Don’t sit on
the Internet all day trying to get a friend, get out there and meet people. Dress pretty, have a
nice life, because you live today and die tomorrow.

I’d want to show them about confidence, social-networking so they can have a good life.

What is one success you are proud of and one failure or regret you’ve tried to forget?

With my work, I’m so happy with Jatali in total, and my biggest regret is breaking up Jatali
with Jamie who owns One Teaspoon, so we didn’t continue to do that together – my biggest
regret and I’ll never get over that.

When it was new, it was too hard and we didn’t have much money and we couldn’t afford to have
us both working on the business, which meant one of us had to get a job. Because she was younger,
she did. But shit, that the biggest regret ever.

We are still friends and still live together. I think we would have been massive if we stayed
together. That’s my only regret in work, I still love her and admire her and she’s 13 years
younger then me, but I still in a way look up to her.

What are you 3 pet hates?

1. Drugs.

2. Marriage – it’s pathetic and retarded.

3. I hate fashion copy-cats! When you create something and people copy it, I find that really
annoying. When people saying you should be happy, it’s flattering, but I don’t want to be
flattered, I know what I do is good.

The Annex – Masculine, Rebellious, Sophisticated



April 28th, 2010





Image:
http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_5455-e1272360760621.jpg

As a guy, I’m always looking for unique clothing and accessories. In Sydney, it’s hard to
find anything unique and stay away from generic brands.

Well I have found a special little store in the depths of Bondi Beach, The Annex Concept Store .

The store combines an ecclectic mix of menswear, which express important elements in mens
fashion – aesthetics, masculinity, rebelliousness and sophistication. This store has
managed to capture all of these elements because the owners Steph and Glen Vilo know what men
want in this city. They want something unique, something that not everyone is wearing and
something that will make them stand out, while also creating their own style.

With a mix of different brands, Steph and Glen realised it was important to mix brands, fabrics
and styles that could all work together. You’ll find leather boots fromÂ  Tuesday
Nightâ€™s Band Practice , transparent bomber jackets fromÂ  Pop Issue and slim line
silhouettes fromÂ  Saint Augustine Academy that pair back with the androgynous designs
fromÂ  Chronicles of Never . The carefully tailored and unique blazers work well with the
beautiful fabrics of theÂ  Nathan Smith basics whilstÂ  Alan Myerson andÂ  Henson
jewellery sits alongside the colognes in the front cabinet.

When I walked in the store, it feels very raw, warehouse, underground and industrial. An
attractive store, which has alot to look at. Just when you thought you’ve seen the whole
store, there is another room to the back which is filled with more.

The thing that stood out most to me were the mens boots as mentioned above. Unusual, well made
and unique designs, I immeditely had a soft spot for these mens shoes – all of them. If you
really want something different in terms of footwear, this is the place to go.

Very limited numbers of stock is available to ensure uniqueness. This is ones very big selling
point for me.

Be sure to check it out and see for yourself – definately a place for any man to visit.

aucklandstockholm – A Stunning New Dimension In Men’s Fashion



April 22nd, 2010





Image: http://adrianerdedi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/aucklandstockholm.jpg

The young, fashionable and creative mind of aucklandstockholm owner Dylan Porter takes mens
fashion down a path of pushing the boundaries without pushing them so far they become a dot.

His awesome new range is so stylish, fun and has an awesome casual Bondi Beach vibe… where
Dylan spends most of his time conceptualising, soaking up the sun and hitting the surf.

Pictured is my favourite ensemble in his collection, the white and black striped shorts and
blazer – very nautical and preppy. It stands out, it’s sharp and its an absolute classic
which you could wear pretty much every single Spring and Summer. High quality materials and
manufacturing, perfect for the classic styled quintessential man. Perfect for lunch at
Icebergs.

You can see aucklandstockholm at Tuchuzy – 90 Gould StÂ Bondi Beach – (02) 9365 5371
