Aj Discala writes about the 2012 Cannes Film Festival

Posted on June 5, 2012 by



Aj Discala as many other people love the Cannes Film festival. Why? Because it is the most
exciting, says Aj Discala with many great movies, great events and a great location launching
the Cote d’Azur season.Â Once a year celebvilles finest migrate from Hollywood to the
sunkissed shores of the south of France.

The 65th annualÂ  Cannes Film Festival Â was held from May 16 to May 27, 2012Â Italian
film directorÂ  Nanni Moretti Â was the President of the Jury.

Aj Discala explains that the festival opened with the US filmÂ  Moonrise Kingdom , directed
byÂ  Wes Anderson Â and closed with the lateÂ  Claude Miller ‘s final filmÂ 
ThÃ©rÃšse Desqueyroux .



Aj Discala says everybody wants to know who the winner is.TheÂ  Palme d’Or Â was
awarded to Austrian directorÂ  Michael Haneke Â for his filmÂ  Love . Haneke
previously won the Palme d’Or in 2009 forÂ  The White Ribbon .



Aj Discala shares that the Austrian directorâ€™s powerful and understated film stars
two French acting icons â€” 85-year-old Emmanuelle Riva and 81-year-old Jean-Louis
Trintignant â€” as an elderly couple coping with the wifeâ€™s worsening health.

Cannes jury member Jean Paul Gaultier praised the performances of the two actors and the
â€œincredible connectionâ€� they established in the movie.

However, says Aj Discala this years festival was characterized by bad weather and the film
selection was criticized.

Although Wes Andersonâ€™s coming-of-age picaresqueÂ  â€œMoonrise
Kingdomâ€� launched the festival on May 16 on a whimsical, adventurous note, the movie
hewed to the directorâ€™s signature controlled, ultra-composed style and thematic
preoccupations with difficult families, precocious children and young love.

Aj Discala explains that from the outset, when organizers announced the directors competing
for the festivalâ€™s top honor, Cannes seemed stalled in a past era: Of the 22 films
competing for the Palme dâ€™Or this week, not one is directed by a woman, a nod to the
mythical image of the heroic auteur that Cannes is famous for championing in its 66-year
history. This entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged AJ Discala by . Bookmark the
