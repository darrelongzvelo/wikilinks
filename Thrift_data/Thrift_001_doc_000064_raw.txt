[ edit ] Early life



Stone was born in Meadville , Pennsylvania . The second of four children, she is the daughter of
Dorothy ( nÃ©e Lawson), an accountant and homemaker , and Joseph William Stone II, a tool and
die manufacturer and factory worker. [1] [2] [3] Stone graduated in 1975 from Saegertown High
School in Saegertown, Pennsylvania . [3]

[ edit ] Career



[ edit ] Modeling



Stone won the title of Miss Crawford County in Meadville, and was a candidate for Miss
Pennsylvania . [3] One of the pageant judges said she should quit school and move to New York
City to become a fashion model. [3] In 1977, Stone left Meadville, moving in with an aunt in New
Jersey . Within four days of her arrival in New Jersey, she was signed by Ford Modeling Agency in
New York.

[ edit ] 1980â€“1989



While living in Europe, she decided to quit modeling and become an actress. “So I packed my
bags, moved back to New York, and stood in line to be an extra in a Woody Allen movie,” she later
recalled. [ citation needed ] While auditioning, she met actress Michelle Pfeiffer , who
recognized her from the pageant she competed in, and the two became friends. [ citation needed
] Stone was cast for a brief role in Allen’s Stardust Memories (1980), [3] and then had a
speaking part a year later in the horror film Deadly Blessing (1981). When French director
Claude Lelouch saw Stone in Stardust Memories , he was so impressed that he cast her in Les Uns et
les Autres (1982), starring James Caan . [ citation needed ] She was on screen for two minutes
and did not appear in the credits.

After starring on the short-lived TV series Bay City Blues in 1983, her next film role was in
Irreconcilable Differences (1984), starring Ryan O’Neal , Shelley Long , and a young Drew
Barrymore . Stone played a starlet who breaks up the marriage of a successful director and his
screenwriter wife. In 1984, she appeared in a two-part episode of Magnum, P.I. , titled
“Echoes of the Mind”, where she played identical twins, one a love interest of Tom Selleck
‘s character.

Through the rest of the 1980s, she had roles in King Solomon’s Mines (1985), Police Academy
4: Citizens on Patrol (1987), Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (1987), Action
Jackson (1988), and Above the Law (1988). Stone was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst
Actress for her performance in Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold . Also in 1988, Stone
took over the role of Janice Henry for the filming of the miniseries War and Remembrance .

Stone in France , 1991

Her appearance in Total Recall (1990) with Arnold Schwarzenegger gave Stone’s career a
boost. [3] To coincide with the film’s release, she posed nude for Playboy , showing off the
muscles she developed in preparation for the film (she lifted weights and learned taekwondo
). In 1999, she was rated among the 25 sexiest stars of the century by Playboy . [4]

The role that made her a star was that of Catherine Tramell , a brilliant, bisexual , alleged
serial killer , in Basic Instinct (1992). [3] Several better known actresses of the time
turned down the part, mostly because of the nudity required. [ citation needed ] In the
film’s most notorious scene, Tramell is being questioned by the police, and she crosses and
uncrosses her legs, revealing the fact she is not wearing any underwear. [5] According to
Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no panties, and although she and Verhoeven
had discussed the scene from the beginning of production, she was unaware just how explicit
the infamous shot would be: [6]

“I knew that we were going to do this leg-crossing thing and I knew that we were going to allude
to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene.
Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers
was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left.” [7]
[8]

Stone at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival

She claimed in an earlier interview, however, that “it was so fun” watching the film for
the first time with strangers. [6] Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, “As
much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot
between her legs, which was a straight lie”. [9] Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas , who later
befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir , Hollywood Animal , that the actress was
fully aware of the level of nudity involved.

Following Basic Instinct , she was listed by People magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful
people in the world. [10] In 1992, photographer George Hurrell took a series of photographs of
Stone, Sherilyn Fenn , Julian Sands , Raquel Welch , Eric Roberts , and Sean Penn . In November
1995, Stone received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , located at 6925 Hollywood Blvd. That
same year, Empire chose her as one of the 100 sexiest stars in film history. In October 1997, she
was ranked among the top 100 film stars of all time by Empire .

In 1995, she received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Dramatic Motion Picture, for
her role as “Ginger” in Martin Scorsese ‘s Casino , opposite Robert De Niro . [3] She also
earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for the role. [3] The same year, she
starred opposite Gene Hackman , Russell Crowe , and Leonardo DiCaprio in the Sam Raimi western
The Quick And The Dead . Also in 1995, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award . [11]

Stone starred opposite Ellen DeGeneres in the 2000 HBO film If These Walls Could Talk 2 , in
which she played a lesbian trying to start a family. For her work on ‘Walls’, she was again
recognized by Women in Film , this time with the Lucy Award . [11]

In 2001, Stone was linked to a biopic of the German film director Leni Riefenstahl . The
prospective director, Paul Verhoeven , and Riefenstahl herself, favoured Stone to portray
Riefenstahl in the film. According to Verhoeven, he discussed the project with Stone and she
was very interested. Subsequently, Verhoeven pulled out of the project as he wanted to hire a
more expensive screenwriter than the producers did. [12] [13]

Stone was hospitalized on September 29, 2001 for a subarachnoid hemorrhage , which was
diagnosed as a vertebral artery dissection rather than the more common ruptured aneurysm ,
and treated with an endovascular coil embolization . [14]

Stone in 2005

In 2003, she appeared in three episodes from the eighth season of The Practice . For her
performances, she received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.

Also in 2003, she appeared in a James Woods -directed American Stroke Association television
commercial to raise awareness of the symptoms of a stroke . This commercial was also shown in
Canada courtesy of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada . [15]

Stone attempted a return to the mainstream with roles in the films Cold Creek Manor (2003) with
Dennis Quaid and Catwoman (2004) with Halle Berry ; however, both films were critical and
commercial flops.

After years of litigation, Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction was released on March 31, 2006. A
reason for a long delay in releasing the film was reportedly Stone’s dispute with the
filmmakers over the nudity in the film; she wanted more, while they wanted less. A group sex
scene was cut in order to achieve an R rating from the MPAA for the U.S. release; the
controversial scene remained in the U.K. version of the London -based film. Stone told an
interviewer, “We are in a time of odd repression and if a popcorn movie allows us to create a
platform for discussion, wouldn’t that be great?” [16]

Despite an estimated budget of $70 million, it placed only 10th in gross on its debut weekend
with a meager $3,200,000, and was subsequently declared a bomb. [17] It ultimately ran in
theaters for only 17 days and finished with a total domestic gross of under $6 million. Despite
the failure of Basic Instinct 2 , Stone has said that she would love to direct and act in a third
Basic Instinct film.

She appeared in the 2006 drama Alpha Dog opposite Bruce Willis , playing Olivia Mazursky, the
mother of a real-life murder victim. Stone wore a fatsuit for the role. [18] In February 2007,
Stone found her role as a clinically depressed woman in her latest film, When a Man Falls in the
Forest , uplifting, as it challenged what she called “ Prozac society.” “It was a
watershed experience,” she said. “I think that we live in a… Prozac society where
we’re always told we’re supposed to have this kind of equilibrium of emotion. We have all
these assignments about how we’re supposed to feel about something.” [19]

In December 2006, she co hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway together with
Anjelica Huston. The concert was in honor of the Nobel Peace Prize winners Muhammad Yunus and
Grameen Bank . [20] Also in that year, she appeared in the last episode of the Turkish TV series
Kurtlar Vadisi (Valley of the Wolves) along with Andy Garcia . [ citation needed ]

On January 5, 2010, it was announced that Stone would be joining the cast of Law & Order: Special
Victims Unit for a four-episode arc beginning in April 2010. She portrayed Jo Marlowe , a
former cop-turned-prosecutor. [21] Her performance has been met with lukewarm reviews.
[22]

[ edit ] Criticism



[ edit ] Tanzania



On January 28, 2005, Stone helped solicit pledges for $1 million in five minutes for mosquito
nets in Tanzania , [23] turning a panel on African poverty into an impromptu fund-raiser at the
World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland . Many observers, including UNICEF , criticized
her actions by claiming that Stone had reacted instinctively to the words of Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa , because she had not done her research on the causes, consequences
and methods of preventing malaria ; if she had done so, she would have found out that most
African governments already distribute free bed nets through public hospitals. [24]

Of the $1 million pledged, only $250,000 was actually raised. In order to fulfill the promise
to send $1 million worth of bed nets to Tanzania, UNICEF contributed $750,000. [25] This
diverted funds from other UNICEF projects. [25] According to prominent economist Xavier
Sala-i-MartÃ­n , officials are largely unaware of what happened with the bed nets. Some
were delivered to the local airport. [25] These reportedly were stolen and later resurfaced
as wedding dresses on the local black market . [24] [25]

[ edit ] Chinese earthquake



Stone sparked a storm of criticism for her comments made in an exchange on the red carpet with
Hong Kong ‘s Cable Entertainment News during the 61st Annual Cannes Film Festival on May 25,
2008. When asked about the 2008 Sichuan earthquake she remarked:

Well you know it was very interesting because at first, you know, I’m not happy about the way
the Chinese are treating the Tibetans because I don’t think anyone should be unkind to
anyone else. And so I have been very concerned about how to think and what to do about that
because I don’t like that. And I had been this, you know, concerned about, oh how should we
deal with the Olympics because they are not being nice to the Dalai Lama, who is a good friend of
mine. And then this earthquake and all this stuff happened, and then I thought, is that Karma?
When you’re not nice then the bad things happen to you? [26] [27]

Observers have noted that Wenchuan County , the epicenter of the earthquake, is located in
Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture , where ethnic Tibetans comprise over half of
the population. According to the Hollywood Reporter , after her comments, one of China’s
biggest cinema chains released statements stating its company would not show her films in its
theaters. [28] The founder of the UME Cineplex chain and the chairman of the Federation of Hong
Kong Filmmakers, Ng See-Yuen called Stone’s comments “inappropriate” and said the
UME Cineplex chain would not be releasing her films in the future. [28] Christian Dior
advertisements featuring Stone’s image were dropped from all ads in China amid the public
uproar. [29] Stone was struck from the 2008 Shanghai International Film Festival guest list,
with the event’s organizers considering a permanent ban for the actress. [30]

Dior China had originally posted an apology in Stone’s name, but Stone later denied making
the apology during an interview with the New York Times , saying “I’m not going to
apologize. I’m certainly not going to apologize for something that isn’t real and
trueÂ â€“ not for face creams,” although she does admit she had “sounded like an
idiot”. [31] While Stone cited the Dalai Lama as her “good friend” when she made the
remark at the Cannes film festival, the Dalai Lama has reportedly distanced himself from her
remark, stating, “yes, I’ve met that lady”. [32] [33]

[ edit ] Mensa



For many years, Stone maintained that she had an IQ of 148 [34] and was a member of Mensa , [35]
[36] but in April 2002, she admitted she was not, and had never been a member of the high-IQ
society. [35] [37] Jim Blackmore of Mensa said, “It’s delightful to finally see Ms. Stone
admit that she’s not and never has been a member of our society.” However, Stone went on to
claim that she “went to a Mensa school.” [37] In response to this new claim, Blackmore said
that would not have been possible as there had been no Mensa schools since the early 1960s. [37]

[ edit ] Personal life



Stone suffers from diabetes [38] [39] and asthma . [40] In March 2006, Stone traveled to Israel
to promote peace in the Middle East through a press conference with Nobel Peace Prize winner
Shimon Peres . [41]

[ edit ] Religion



Stone is a convert to Tibetan Buddhism . [42] She believes in God and is religious by
self-description. [43] She is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church . [44]

[ edit ] Relationships



Stone married television producer Michael Greenburg in 1984 on the set of The Vegas Strip War ,
a television film he produced and she starred in. The couple separated three years later, and
their divorce was finalized in 1990. [45]

In 1993, Stone met William J. MacDonald (aka Bill MacDonald) on the set of the film Sliver ,
which he co-produced. MacDonald left his wife Naomi Baca for Stone and became engaged to her.
They separated one year later in 1994. [46]

While working on the film The Quick and the Dead in 1995, Stone met Bob Wagner (a second
assistant director) and they became engaged. After they separated, Stone returned the
engagement ring via FedEx . [47]

On February 14, 1998, Stone married Phil Bronstein , executive editor of the San Francisco
Examiner and later San Francisco Chronicle . [48] Stone and Bronstein were divorced in 2004.
[49] They adopted a baby son, Roan Joseph Bronstein, in 2000. [50] Stone adopted her second
son, Laird Vonne Stone, in 2005, [51] and her third son, Quinn Kelly Stone, in 2006. [45] [52]

In 2005, during a television interview for her film Basic Instinct 2 , Stone hinted at an
interest in bisexuality , stating “Middle age is an open-minded period”. [53] Stone also
has said that in the past she’s “dated” girls. Furthermore, in Naked Instinct , an
unauthorized biography of Stone, author Frank Sanello details a sexual liaison between
Stone and a woman in the bathroom of the Beverly Hills Hotel . [54] In an interview on the Michael
Parkinson talk show in Britain on March 18, 2006, she said she was straight . However, in
January 2008, she was quoted as saying, “Everybody is bisexual to an extent. Now men act like
women and it’s difficult to have a relationship because I like men in that old-fashioned
way. I like masculinity and, in truth, only women do that now”. [55]

In 2011, Stone stated on Piers Morgan Tonight that she was never married to George Howe Englund
Jr., despite contrary internet rumors. [56]
