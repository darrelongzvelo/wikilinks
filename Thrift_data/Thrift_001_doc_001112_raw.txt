Canada's Military Space Policy:

Part 2, The Changing Political Landscape



The recent announcement that the Department of National Defence (DND) is set to release an "
updated " but not substantially changed Canadian military space policy over the next few
months suggests a series of obvious questions.



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TRk4RNWFWcI/AAAAAAAAAlY/caNyX89b6bo/s200/Jean_Chretien_2010.jpg
Jean Cretien, the 20th Prime Minister of Canada.

In part one of this blog post, titled " The Axworthy Doctrine ," I attempted to answer some of
those questions by showing how the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's led
Canada to re-orient defense spending away from traditional Canadian priorities and towards
international peacekeeping missions as defined by the concept of " human security ."



This doctrine, initially viewed by the governing liberal party under Jean ChrÃ©tien as a
great way to save money, also created a requirement to support a far more combat capable force
on lengthy international missions.



The easiest way to do that, at least according to the Summer 2000 Canadian Military Journal
article " Is the Sky Falling? Canada's Defence Space Program at the Crossroads ," was to
develop an indigenous military space communications and surveillance capability.
According to the article:

The massive troop deployments of the 1990s highlighted the immediate requirement for
adequate indigenous Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM). The increased
employment of precision guided munitions demonstrated a growing dependence on accurate
strategic intelligence, satellite imagery, and satellite navigation and positioning.
Also, the general increase in littoral operations by naval forces placed a greater
dependence on accurate meteorological and geodetic capabilities.



As the (Canadian) government continued to commit Canadian Forces across the world, more and
more space support was necessary. Reluctantly perhaps, the Liberal government accepted
that the militarization of space was a long-existing fact that had to be publicly supported if
it was to meet other foreign policy goals. Why was the Liberal government reluctant to accept
the " militarization of space " as a long existing fact? According to the article there was
ample precedent for this reluctance:



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TRk6Kd5VL7I/AAAAAAAAAlg/b1Vf1RidAvU/s320/Pierre+Trudeau+in+1971.jpg
Pierre Trudeau, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada in 1971. Canada’s endorsement of the
United Nation’s treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in 1963 (the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty ) and the United Nation’s Outer Space Treaty (UNOST) in 1967 were
interpreted almost verbatim by Ottawa, and led to the removal of DRB (the Defence Research
Board ) control from most of Canada’s space projects.



The first Trudeau government saw no distinction between the militarization of space
(placing military space assets in orbit) and the ‘weaponization’ of space (placing
weapons in orbit), and moved quickly to deprive Canada’s military of any space assets or
capability.



In 1968, the government withdrew financial support from most defence space projects,
preferring instead to concentrate its resources on the development of a domestic satellite
communications system. In essence, the longtime Canadian government policy, starting from
the 1960's and continuing at least until the middle 1990's, was to simply " withdraw financial
support " from the military in favor of civilian programs (like Telesat Canada , a federal
government crown corporation formed in 1969 to improve communications in the far North) and
scientific satellites.



But by 1994, this historic neglect of the Canadian military was no longer a reasonable option.
According to the article:

As future space technologies all but eliminate Canada’s traditional geographic
situational importance, Ottawa will have to rely on providing a share of the security burden
rather than relying on the outdated American involuntary guarantee of protection. These new
technologies, and the potential for even more radical improvements on the horizon helped the
Canadian military to push forward a plan to insure that a requirement for a Canadian
communications and surveillance capability would be at the core of the 1998 military space
policy.





Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TRk8x5aRgXI/AAAAAAAAAlk/lXla70zgazA/s1600/War+on+Terror.jpg
But almost immediately, the Canadian military's precarious financial position virtually
guaranteed the continued, heavy reliance on foreign, mostly US space assistance to fulfill
defense needs which put a considerable strain on that relationship.



As well, an evolving US strategy (ironically enough, based on core concepts quite similar to
those found in the Canadian advocated Axworthy Doctrine) slowly caused the ChrÃ©tien
government to back away from some of the more critical practices associated with the US " war on
terror ."



So we've moved away from the situation existing throughout the 1960's to the 1990's where
Canadian space policy provided no support whatsoever for military projects to the point
where where the federal government perceives a need to develop an indigenous military space
communications and surveillance capability to support Canadian troops on international
missions and knew that they couldn't just rely on the Americans to do the job for them.



This brings us to the period around 2008 and the Harper Governments Canada First - Defense
Strategy . How does the issuance of that government policy paper influence and effect the
current and potential next Canadian military space policy document?



That will be the subject of our 3rd post on this topic . Posted by Chuck Black 0 comments Links to

Part 1, The Axworthy Doctrine



The recent announcement by Colonel AndrÃ© Dupuis, the Director of the Department of
National Defence (DND) Directorate of Space Development (DSpaceD) that DND is set to release
an " updated " but not substantially changed Canadian military space policy early in 2011
suggests a series of obvious questions.

Lloyd Axworthy, as drawn by Graeme Mackay . At the very least, if the new policy is going to be
pretty much the same as the old policy, then what was the old policy?



For the answer, we need to start with something called the 1994 Canadian White Paper on Defence
.



Called the " Axworthy Doctrine " after incoming Liberal MP Lloyd Axworthy (who helped
originate and champion many of the ideas in the document), the focus of the 1994 white paper was
to scale back expenditures allocated by the outgoing Conservative government in order to
allow Canada to take advantage of the so called " peace dividend " expected to accrue to western
democracies after the collapse of their major opponent, the Soviet Union .



Included among the cuts was Canada's traditional commitment to the " level and tempo of
Canada-U.S. defense relations, particularly in NORAD, (the North American Aerospace
Defense Command , which) has been decreasing since the late1980s " according to the document "
Canada, Getting it Right This Time: The 1994 Defence White Paper " published by the Strategic
Studies Institute (SSI) of the United States Army War College .



Canadian contributions to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) were also cut back
as were Canadian financial contributions to the NATO allied infrastructure program and
force levels for the CF-18 Hornet fighter jet.





Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TRjk_ZxJ_VI/AAAAAAAAAlE/4Kvf_Pcb5ig/s400/NORAD+HQ.jpg
The current NORAD HQ in Building 2 at Peterson Air Force Base. Cheyenne Mountain is "no longer
used on a daily basis" according to Wikipedia. But while military cutbacks to Canada's NATO
and NORAD contributions might seem like a sane and sensible policy for laymen like you and I,
those cutbacks also undermined two of the four traditional pillars of Canadian military
policy (the other two are protection of Canadian sovereignty and international
peacekeeping missions).



Even worse, the Axworthy Doctrine suggested that direct threats to North American security
requiring sovereignty protection capabilities were unlikely in the foreseeable future.
With three of the four traditional justifications for a Canadian military seemingly under
fire from an incoming government mandated to slash spending, a new rationale was needed for
Canadian military spending.



This is where the Axworthy Doctrine got creative.



It championed a concept called " human security " which challenged traditional notions of
international security  by arguing that security should be focused around the individual
instead of the state. It also argued that the United Nations (UN) had a " responsibility to
protect " people anywhere in the world against genocide and ethnic cleansing attempts, even
to the extent of invading or interfering in the internal politics of otherwise sovereign
nations.





Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TRjmYbWkdoI/AAAAAAAAAlI/FmwSkGpSMpk/s1600/Shake+Hands+with+the+Devil.jpg
An account of the 1994 UN mission. Axworthy (who eventually became Minister of Foreign
Affairs in the Jean ChrÃ©tien liberal government) felt this new Canadian military role
could be undertaken by the existing Canadian Forces without the need for any additional
military expenditures. In essence, the ruling liberal government could legitimately task
the Canadian Forces with the Axworthy Doctrine and still cut military funding.



Was this a great country or what?



To be fair, the doctrine was widely considered to be a reasonable response to help prevent a
repeat of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide where the Canadian commander of a UN peace keeping mission
(Lieutenant General Romeo Dallaire ) was prevented from taking steps he felt would diffuse
the situation and save lives.



But even in this area, the "Axworthy Doctrine" was a two edge sword. According to the Canadian
Encyclopedia :

It may sound warm and fuzzy on the surface, but underlying that vision is the cold hard
recognition that military intervention may be necessary to achieve this end. Rejecting the
sanctity of national borders that has been central to the UN since its founding in 1945, the
proposal would create a sort of official licence to invade. The concept of a " license to invade
" rogue regimes for the greater good found an obvious following in the United States
(especially after 9/11) which initially provided much of the support infrastructure needed
to send Canadian soldiers around the world.





Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TRjoYkf41lI/AAAAAAAAAlM/FIdKkDXpYtk/s400/Other+rogue+regimes.jpg
A cartoon about another rogue regime. Unfortunately, the Americans soon started making
noise about how Canada should build their own infrastructure, and not simply piggy back on
existing US capabilities so Axworthy ended up being wrong about his doctrine not needing new
expenditures to support combat capable troops on lengthy international missions



Oddly enough, the easiest way to support the Axworthy Doctrine was to develop an indigenous
military space communications and surveillance capability to support Canadian missions
abroad.



The requirements for this capability (which led directly to the formulation of Canada's 1998
military space policy) and a bit of background on why there was no Canadian military space
policy prior to 1998 will be the subject of our 2nd post on this topic . Posted by Chuck Black 0

Holiday Notes from Commercial Space



For those of you who don't have enough space stories to read over the holiday season, here are
five items currently being tracked:



    Image:
    http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TRDFV_SDgiI/AAAAAAAAAks/taS2cF84qzM/s200/Bob+Richards.jpg
    Dr. Robert Richards.

    - The December 20th, 2010 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) press
    release titled " NASA Selects Companies for Future Lunar Demonstration Data " lists San
    Fransisco based Moon Express Inc. as one of three companies receiving delivery orders
    under the Innovative Lunar Demonstrations Data (ILDD) project to develop vehicle
    capabilities and demonstrate end-to-end robotic lunar landing missions. Canadian
    born entrepreneur and Moon Express founder/ team leader Dr. Robert D. Richards is also
    the founder and former CEO of Odyssey Moon , an Isle of Man based commercial lunar
    enterprise and the first official contender in the Google Lunar X PRIZE (GLXP)
    competition. There is no word on why Dr. Richards left Odyssey Moon to form Moon Express,
    which is also in competition for the GLXP, but his new company seems to have jumped ahead of
    his old firm (and most of the rest of the GLXP pack) with this NASA announcement. The GLXP
    offers a total of $30 million in prizes to the first privately funded teams to land a robot
    on the Moon and successfully complete a series of tasks.

    DEXTRE

    - According to the December 17th, 2010 NASA press release " Dextre's Final Exam Scheduled
    for December 22-23, 2010 " the scrappy little Canadian contraption officially known as
    the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulato r (SPDM), a component of the Mobile Servicing
    System on the International Space Station (ISS) will finally roll out for duty aboard the
    ISS. As outlined in my October 3rd, 2010 Commercial Space post " DEXTRE Corner Cutting,
    Com Dev Deal Making and IAC Storytelling " the final checkout had been delayed because of a
    July 2010 failure when DEXTRE simply didn't have the capability to remove a
    failed power controller on the ISS, due to the use of "low fidelity" hardware in order to
    save money.

    Mike Pley

    - Long-time employee and interim chief executive officer Mike Pley has been confirmed as
    permanent CEO of space hardware manufacturer Com Dev International according to the
    December 14th, 2010 CNW Group press release " COM DEV names Michael Pley as CEO ." Fired CEO
    John Keating doesn't seem to have done anything wrong during his tenure, except perhaps
    for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, according to the December 14th, 2010 Ottawa
    Business Journal article " Com Dev makes CEO permanent in bid to boost profitability "
    which quotes Com Dev chair Terry Reidel as stating that " we determined that our
    performance targets can best be achieved through a course correction rather than
    through sweeping change ." Elizabeth Howell, over on the PARS3C blog , in her November
    11th, 2010 article " COM DEV adds another satellite win to roster " says the Cambridge,
    Ont.-based firm is relying on repeat business from existing customers to maintain
    revenue.

    - Canadian space icon Macdonald Dettwiler (MDA) continues its exceptional run of good
    luck, according to the December 13th, 2010 Canadian Press article " Quebec invests $9m to
    aid MacDonald, Dettwiler expand Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue plant ." According to the
    article, the money comes on top of a no-interest loan of $9 million and " an additional
    $900,000 " to help train employees. The funds will " allow MDA to make investments they
    would not have done otherwise ," according to Quebec premier Jean Charest who is quoted in
    the article. According to an earlier December 3rd, 2010 Ottawa Citizen article " The
    $25-Billion Question Who gets what... and why " a total of $158.6 million had been spend up
    until that time in fiscal year 2010 by the various Canadian government departments for a
    series of MDA contracts relating to satellite and military surveillance technologies.
    This is up 71% from fiscal year 2009, when the government halted the sale of the BC firm to a
    US company for security reasons and the December 13th announcement will only add
    additional revenue to MDA bottom line.

    

    



    

    - And finally, US astronaut Donald R. Pettit , known around NASA as an uncommonly gifted
    handyman capable of rebuilding a jet engine in his garage workshop (at least according to
    the November 14th, 2008 New York Times article " Handyman to Return to His Space Workshop
    ") can also claim a patent for a zero-gravity coffee cup, which used the wetting angle to
    carry the coffee along a crease to permit drinking and avoid the necessity of a straw. A
    newer version of the cup (perhaps with a jaunty Canadian flag on the outside plus a couple
    of pounds of Tim Horton's coffee) seems like an appropriate present for Canadian
    astronaut Chris Hadfield , who is currenty training to become the second Canadian to take
    part in a long-duration spaceflight aboard the ISS beginning in 2012.

    

Mmm... Now I know what I want for Christmas.

ASX in 2011. Media savvy. Since incorporating as a nonprofit in 2003, the community managed
Astronomy & Space Exploration Society (ASX) at the University of Toronto has grown into one of
the largest space focused organizations in Canada with approximately 2300 members building
public events to educate, excite, and inspire students, professionals and the general
public on astronomy and space.

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TQ_vF6cnFDI/AAAAAAAAAkk/-GAujHRK0zo/s200/Billboards+in+Space.jpg
Pizza for ISS in 2001 . Not media savvy. They're a knowledgeable group of up and coming experts
who bring marketing savvy and social media expertise to an industry long dominated by the dull
press releases and boring media advisories that more properly belong to an earlier era.



Lately, ASX members have branched out to share their knowledge with other organizations. ASX
past president Farnaz Ghadaki spoke on 'Next Generation Considerations for
Commercialization of Space' and 'Space Marketing' at the 2010 Canadian Space Summit while
another ASX past president, Tahir Merali was a plenary speaker at the 61st Annual
International Astronautical Congress (IAC2010), held in the Czech Republic last October.



But the core focus for the organization has always been the January " Expanding Canada's
Frontiers " symposium and the lineup for their 8th annual event, scheduled for Friday,
January 28th, 2011 from 7:00-9:00 PM has just been released. The focus for 2011 is on
"unraveling the universe" with speakers including:

    

    - Dr. Alexei Vladimir Filippenko , a professor of astronomy at the University of
    California, Berkeley and a member of the National Academy of Sciences . Filippenko is
    considered to be one of the worlds most highly sited astrophysicists and has spearheaded
    efforts to develop robotic telescopes, including the Katzman Automatic Imaging
    Telescope (KAIT), which is helping to conduct the Lick Observatory Supernova Search
    (LOSS). He is also a prominent member of both the High-Redshift Supernova Search Team and
    the Hubble Space Telescope Nuker Team which uses high-resolution imaging and
    spectroscopy to investigate the structure and dynamics of normal galaxies. His
    research focuses on supernovae and active galaxies at optical , ultraviolet , and
    near-infrared wavelengths. 

    

    

    - Dr. Michel Lefebvre , a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the
    University of Victoria  who founded the Canadian ATLAS collaboration which
    contributed to the construction of the ATLAS particle detector that currently study
    high energy proton-proton collisions in the Large Hadron Collider , at the European
    Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Lefebvre has also served on and chaired the
    Subatomic Physics Grant Selection Committee of the Natural Sciences and Engineering
    Research Council of Canada (NSERC). His research focuses on high energy particle
    physics, the development, the origin of mass and quantum field gauge theories. 

    

    

    - Dr. Gilbert Holder , an associate professor of physics at McGill University . He is
    also the chairholder of the Canada Research Chair in Cosmological Astrophysics and a
    scholar with the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research ’s (CIfAR) Cosmology &
    Gravity Program. His research focuses on astrophysics and cosmology, studies of the
    cosmic microwave background, large scale structure in the universe, dark energy, the
    first stars and massive clusters of galaxies.

held in the ample facilities at  Convocation Hall , 31 Kings College Circle on the University
of Toronto campus.



The event is free for current U of T students who have registered in advanced ( click here for
student registeration ), $15 dollars CDN until January 6th, 2011 for those of us who are no
longer in school ( click here for non-student registration ) and $20 dollars CDN after January
6th for those of us who are simply a little slow to register. Posted by Chuck Black 0 comments

Canadian Teachers Funding American Rockets





Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TQjBtIHjmwI/AAAAAAAAAkU/Dr1GS0g1xu4/s1600/Proposed+Kistler+K-1.jpg
The proposed K-1 reusable rocket The December 11th, 2010 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Online
article " Financial meltdown scuttles dreams of Green Bay's rocket man " tells the story of
businessman George French, who almost succeeded in turning his private dream of going to
space into direct competition with Space Exploration Technologies (Space-X) for a series of
lucrative government contracts to supply the International Space Station (ISS).



According to the article, "French enlisted a high-tech investment bank to help raise the
serious capital and secured commitments, he said, for more than $300 million, much of it from a
Canadian teachers' pension fund."



Say again? An unnamed Canadian teachers pension fund investing serious money in an American
space focused start-up?



Mmm...





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TQi-zXRu5vI/AAAAAAAAAkM/RmKyGAm4SVc/s1600/Rocketplane+PR+Image.jpg
Rocketplane PR image. The article tells the story of Rocketplane , an Oklahoma based, space
tourism start-up incorporated in 2001 under founder and CEO French, using his own funds and
Oklahoma state law provisions allowing the company to claim and then resell state approved
tax credits as a qualified space transportation provider in order to raise money.



French initially envisioned building an aircraft, rocket hybrid that would send passengers
more than 330,000 feet (100 km) above the Earth. Rocketplane was an early competitor for the
Ansarii X-Prize which was eventually won by the Burt Rutan designed SpaceShipOne .



But Rocketplane eventually needed to branch out.



In 2006, after failing to win the X-Prize, the company purchased Kistler Aerospace Corp.,
which had just gone through bankruptcy but possessed a potential design for a reusable
orbital rocket, the K-1 . The combined company then used the orbital rocket design as a basis
for a winning bid to develop crew and cargo launch services, as part of the NASA Commercial
Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, for the International Space Station .

Comparison between Space-X Falcon 9 and K-1

This is where the real serious trouble started.



The COTS contract shook loose some seed money, but according to the article "it was nowhere
near the hundreds of millions the company needed to build and launch the K-1."



But it did include substantial amounts from the unnamed Canadian teachers pension fund.



However, according to the article, the teachers money wasn't enough and the sub-prime
mortgage crisis turned Wall Street cold on raising further funds. NASA, after twice
postponing a deadline for Rocketplane to show a bank balance sufficient to complete the
project, canceled the contract and went with Space-X.



The various entities which made up Rocketplane slowly went bankrupt or shut down with the
final component ( Rocketplane Kistler ) sliding into bankruptcy protection on June 15th,
2010.



The article makes no mention about whether the unnamed Canadian teachers pension fund ever
got it's money back, but budding Canadian entrepreneurs should take note that sometimes,
staid institutional investors just might put money in projects, even when they are just a
little bit "out of this world."

NASA's Direction and Canada's Opportunity





Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TQVYdsXC0uI/AAAAAAAAAj8/zyZ3vklKdBA/s1600/Canadian+Flag.JPG
While it's true that "it ain't over until it's over" the outlines of the new direction for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are finally beginning to come clear.



Canadian companies, and especially the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) should take a close look
to note that the American plans don't seem to include any specific requirement for Moon or
Martian rovers.



They are instead focused on smaller investments in multiple areas (especially alternative
propulsion technologies such as VASIMR or ion engines of the types used on the Hayabusa
unmanned spacecraft ) to encourage the development of a series of breakthrough
technologies.



There's even a Facebook page, titled " NASA's New Direction: Space Propulsion and Power "
which provides links to some of the new technologies being developed and background
materials outlining the reasons for the new focus.





Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TQVh0GEo41I/AAAAAAAAAkA/HdldHlzV_KM/s400/US+House.jpg
The US House of Representatives. Even at the political level, the deal is close to being done
with money allocated across the board to include development of a new heavy lift rocket , plus
the continuation of the commercial, off the shelf (COTS) program and the commercial crew
development (CCDev) program.



The December 9th, 2010 article on the Space Politics blog titled " CR passes House, with an
interesting shuttle provision " states:

The House last night narrowly approved a yearlong continuing resolution last night . The
bill, as previously noted here , splits the difference between the authorized level of $19
billion for NASA and the FY10 level of just over $18.7 billion, and includes funds for HLV
development as well as COTS and commercial crew. The Senate plans to develop its own omnibus
spending bill which, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) tells Florida Today, would also fund NASA at
$18.9 billion , but allocate funds among various programs differently. There’s some
question, though, if the Senate version would win out over the House’s CR. The most recent
visible activity related to COTS and CCDev is last weeks successful launch by Space
Exploration Technologies (Space-X) of it's Falcon 9 rocket and the recovery of the payload
Dragon capsule .



Media pundits (including me, last week in this CTV interview ) have called it a "milestone" and
the "first successful private launch into orbit."







Of course, most of the big ticket NASA funding is politically directed and designed to provide
a cushion to large aerospace focused companies with contracts winding down and employees
likely to loose their jobs.



But the real key to NASA's future is epitomized by people like recently appointed NASA chief
technologist Robert Braun . Here's a talk he gave earlier this year on the topic of NASA's
future.







Of particular interest in the presentation is the focus on developing multiple avenues for
"breakthrough" technologies which, when taken together, create the capability to send
increasing numbers of large "two story house" sized objects to Mars in order to provide a
platform for manned exploration of the red planet.



This path seems to be at odds with the recent Canadian focus on smaller, unmanned rovers using
existing or incremental technological improvements in order to explore Mars on a smaller
scale and remotely.



The CSA, with it's focus on smaller rovers and the next generation Canadarm funded through the
$110 million Canadian Economic Action Plan , might not be in a position to take advantage of the
American opportunities as they develop, especially since the Canadian fund is scheduled to
wind down in March 2011, well before the Americans get down to their business of  developing
the next generation of useful space technologies.

Muslim Pride Supporting Canadian Spaceport





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TP4-a4IlQDI/AAAAAAAAAj0/dlSxOnQQ4uI/s200/Redouane.jpg
BC astronomer, Dr. Redouane Al Fakir. 



The Vancouver based Mohammad Institute for Space Science doesn't want to wait for a Canadian
Space Agency (CSA) contract before moving forward with space exploration.



According to the December 5th, 2010 Canadian Press article, " Head of Muhammad Institute
wants B.C. space-launch site ," the institute is raising money to build a Canadian commercial
space port off the coast of Vancouver using funds from private investors in Qatar , Saudi
Arabia , the United Arab Emirates plus other gulf and Muslim states.



The article quotes the head of the Muhammad Institute, Dr. Redouane Al Fakir as stating that
his goal has always been to " return Muslims to the place of pride they held, centuries ago, as
world leaders in astronomy ."



To that end, Dr. Al Fakir says he's secured $250,000 in startup money from overseas sources and
has begun an international fund raising drive to raise the estimated $100-million it would
take to build the facility.







The three year old organization has a number of other projects on the go including an orbital
telescope and a plan to land a small unmanned research spacecraft on the Moon by 2015 according
to the October 25th, 2010 AhlulBayt News Agency post " Mohammd Moon Station to Be Set Up ."



The organizations website at www.muhammadinstitute.org goes into quite a bit of detail
about what they call Mohammad Moon Station 1 and offer the ability to participate in the
mission with a symbolic donation so it would seem easy enough to dismiss their claims as simple
publicity. 



However the page listing the people at the Muhammad Institute include influential
scientists and space advocates who I would be loath to dismiss without at least giving them
some opportunity to follow up on their claims.



The September 1st, 2009 Vancouver Sun article " B.C. astronomer reviving Islamic science "
reports substantial support among the BC based scientific community for the organization:

Al Fakir's far-reaching goals are being supported by dozens of the world's leading thinkers
and scientists, including the former head of UBC's interdisciplinary studies program,
Rhodri Windsor-Liscombe, and renowned UBC astronomer Bill Unruh.



"I find Redouane's plans highly commendable and ambitious," Unruh said.

 

"His goal ... is to try to increase the visibility and practice of science in the world's Muslim
communities by bringing together their scientists with the best established scientists
from around the world, independent of their religious or non-religious affiliation."

 

Unruh believes the wider scientific community feels "a lot of goodwill" toward Al Fakir's
enterprise, as reflected in the long list of high-calibre scientists who have become
associated with his plans. The fund raising for the spaceport will be done under the
organizational umbrella of a company called Space Launch Canada and not under the banner of
the Muhammad Institute, but $100 million CDN is a lot of money for any organization to raise.



However, I'm open to seeing what Dr. Al Fakir is able to generate over the next few years. Posted

"Faces of Space" at the University of Toronto

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TPw1E_hLXLI/AAAAAAAAAjw/eY6p2QK2eTs/s1600/Hart+House.jpg
The Hart House tower. Farnaz Ghadaki, one of my colleagues at the Canadian Space Commerce
Association (where I currently serve as secretary/ treasurer and one of the five directors)
has signed me up for the next Astronomy and Space Exploration Society (ASX) "Faces of Space"
talk at the University of Toronto .



I'll be speaking this Thursday, December 9th, at the St. George campus Hart House building
(located at 7 Hart House Cir, Toronto) in the East Common Room (starting at 7pm EST) on the topic
of the commercialization of space.



Ghadaki and ASX president Ray Chen have also said that I'm only able to babble on for forty-five
minutes or so before shutting up and letting the audience ask some questions.

The map to Hart House. This might be difficult given that I've written 160+ short 500 word
articles over the last eighteen months for both this blog and Spaceref.ca on the topic of space
commercialization.



Either there is a lot involved to the topic or I'm very long winded. Anyway, all are welcome to
come out and see which one it is.



There is no charge for the event (but please RSVP to space.society@utoronto.ca , and include
as the subject line "FoS1").



Afterwords, most of us are going to the Molly Bloom Irish Pub at 191 College Street to network
and share tall tales of daring and adventure. Posted by Chuck Black 0 comments Links to this

Commercial Space Activities Utilizing the Canadian Economic Action Plan





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SjnNZeKhheo/TPu28TPu9UI/AAAAAAAAAjg/ed0IhkDr5oY/s200/canadian-money.jpg
Except for the RADARSAT constellation program (which is separately funded by the federal
government), one or two Canadian military programs (such as Sapphire ) and any money that
might be saved by downsizing it's astronaut corps (which is what the US is studying, according
to the December 1st, 2010 article in the Los Angeles Times titled " Astronauts considered in
NASA budget cuts "), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) yearly budget of approximately  $375
million doesn't really do much more than support existing infrastructure and maintain
ongoing projects.



In essence, it provides enough cash on hand to keep the lights on at CSA headquarters in the John
H. Chapman Space Centre , but not a whole lot more.



That's why the Canadian Economic Action Plan , with its additional $110 million CDN allocated
for exploration surface mobility (Moon rovers) and the next generation Canadarm is so
important to the CSA. The action plan provides the only real funding for pretty much
everything new the CSA is going to be able to develop over the next few years.

Lights on at CSA HQ. Photo courtesy WZMH Architects . Unfortunately, this program is winding
down in March 2011.



For those of us who follow these things, here is a partial list of Canadian companies and
organizations involved in recent contracts awarded to Neptec Design Group and Macdonald
Dettwiler (MDA) for $11.5 million each to build the lunar exploration light rover (LELR)
prototype.

    

    - The Neptec project will include contributions from Ontario Drive and Gear , Com Dev
    Canada , McGill University , the Northern Centre for Advanced Technology (NORCAT) and
    NGC Aerospace . 

    

    

    - The MDA project will " develop two next-generation lunar rover prototypes " according
    to the November 19th, 2010 Vancouver Sun article " MDA inks 11.5m deal for two lunar rovers
    " and will be integrated with a number of other Canadian technologies being developed
    under " separate MDA contracts. " This likely means that MDA will develop most of their
    prototype internally while Neptec depends on external expertise.

    

It's worth noting that, according to the November 22nd Spaceref.ca article " MDA and Neptec
Awarded Contracts to Build Lunar Exploration Light Rover Prototypes ," the awarded
contracts are simple design studies and no actual rovers may ever get built:

Currently there is no funding to develop a production lunar rover that would actually go to the
moon. However the investments made to date are intended to position Canada in such a way that if
Canada's space exploration partners agree on a rover mission to the Moon that Canada would be
poised to contribute in a significant way. So the CSA is essentially " working on spec "with the
lunar rover program, investing time and resources with no guarantee of future funding and no
real market (so far).



The primary funding program for the rovers is also winding down next spring. It will be
interesting to see if this CSA gamble to develop new projects for future space missions ever
pays off. Posted by Chuck Black 0 comments Links to this post
