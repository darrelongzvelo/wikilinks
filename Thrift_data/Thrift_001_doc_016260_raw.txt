Demon tactic #301: “Tell them to wait.” What’s the Bible about? → June 8, 2012 ·

The Bible may be the best truth we are ignoring





Image: http://andrewejenkins.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/umpire1.jpg?w=300&h=199
There are several ways off looking at reality, of looking at the issue of â€œ objective
truth .â€� A story of three umpires summarizes the possibilities quite well…

â€œThereâ€™s balls and thereâ€™s strikes,â€� says the first,
â€œand I call them the way they are.â€�

â€œNo!â€� exclaims the second, â€œThatâ€™s arrogant. Thereâ€™s
balls and thereâ€™s strikes and I call them the way I see them.â€�

â€œThatâ€™s no better,â€� says the third. â€œWhy not be realistic about
it…? Thereâ€™s balls and thereâ€™s strikes and they ainâ€™t nothing till
I call them!â€�

    The three positions characterize people today.

    - Those who call it objectively â€“ and see truth as an entity existing on its own
    (calling it the way it is, like the first).

    

    

    - Those who admit some degree of subjectivity. .. and feel like we create truth in some way,
    as we interpret and apply it (call it like we see it, like the second umpire). And ,

    

    

    - There are those who suggest we create reality completely , that there is no objective
    truth!

    



It seems that more and more society is leaning towards the perspective of the third umpire.
Weâ€™re not even like the second, just claiming to bring our own baggage to the table with
us. Rather, weâ€™re creating our own realities on our own rules and terms. This is
dangerous territory. For, remember, feelings and instincts and even good intuitions do not
change the nature of Truth . Truth exists outside ourselves, and it helps to have that standard
(i.e. like the first umpire) whereby we can understand the world around us.

A pilot I heard about was flying (during lessons) and hadnâ€™t looked at the gauges in a
while. His flight instructor, keenly aware of the situation, asked him how things were
going… He thought everything was fine, and he told the instructor. â€œAll
good,â€� he said.

The teacher, then, told him to look at the gauges … He did, and he learned he was flying
straight down at a rapid rate! He felt fine, though…. And â€œhis realityâ€�
suggested he was O.K. The point, though, is that, like him, we need a gauge of truth, a barometer
or thermometer…

Amidst this situation, the Bible claims to present truthâ€“ objective truthâ€“
unchanging, uncompromising truth. And, what is strange is that, even in our world that is
sliding into the perspective of the third umpire, the Bible is gaining popularity.

People now have access to the Bible like no other book. Richard Abanes writes,

â€œThe Bibleâ€“ historyâ€™s best-selling and most widely distributed
bookâ€“ is enjoying even greater popularity as time passes. Bible sales in 1995 climbed
to a record $54 million from $29 million in 1991. Not surprisingly, Bible printing and
distribution has become a lucrative industry, with a growing number of publishers and
private entrepreneurs entering the business. Even media magnate Ted Turner has released an
edition of Scripture: â€˜a gilt-edged, 17-pound, $395 version of the Holy Bible
[NRSV]… Printed in Italy on six- colored presses and sparkling with metallic-gold ink,
this oversized, boxed masterpiece features rare images from illuminated Renaissance
manuscripts locked away for centuries in the Vatican Library.â€™â€�

But, despite the access, rather than looking at it as objective truth, many of us opt for the
position of one of the other umpires. Just because we have access to Scripture does not mean we
trust it. Indeed, it doesnâ€™t even mean that we know whatâ€™s written in the
pages.

    Here are some of the issues, though:

    - People can cite the fact that the Bible is the best-seller of all time, but they
    canâ€™t quote anything from it.

    

    

    - People cannot name four or five books of the Bible, but they could give you four or five
    names from this yearâ€™s World Series .

    

    

    - People claim Jesus is the greatest Teacher to have ever lived, but who can actually
    quoteâ€“ or even misquoteâ€“ anything that Jesus actually said?

    

    

    - Can you give me the names of the twelve disciples? I bet you can give me those of the Seven
    Dwarfs…

    

    

    - Whatâ€™s the greatest achievement of John the Baptist ? What about that of John
    Lennon?

    Some people are focused too much on worldly things and not things of God. In order for you to
    have a life more abundantly you have to change you’re desires and thought process.

    I agree with kelly. We have to renew our mind daily because we are on a constant battle
    field, every day satan is seeking out someone to destroy. He only comes to steal, kill ,and
    destroy. Jesus came that we may have life and have it more abundantly., but the key is to
    seek him first and all these other things shall be added to you. Reply

    I believe the bible is the truth, i just believe that people choose to not listen to the
    truth that would mean they have to live on someones terms other than theres. If we read the
    bible and apply it in our everyday lives we will be okay only we have the choice to listen to
    the truth which is the bible or listen to themselves instead which is the devil talking
    through us. Reply

    In my experience i have learned to stop desiring things not of God even though i still do
    sometimes i know the way to live life is to desire things and the ways of God. Strive to be
    like Jesus! Reply

    I believe the Bible is the truth. I believe the Bible also has a bigger story between the
    lines. When I read God’s inspired word I pray that the mystery to the Gospel is revealed
    to me. When I really open my mind to what God has to say I am amazed at what He reveals to me.

    For me it has been a battle for whenever I get close to God I’m reading the bible daily an
    everything falls into place. Thats when you seek him the most I started my day reading
    something to get filled up so my day will go by a lot smoother it just seems to be that way.

    I don’t think we are ignoring it a lot of people just don’t understand what they are
    reading,and others really don’t care at all.I bet if there were some way the bible was
    fix like some kind of video game then many people know more about it.Sad but true. Reply

    theres is a paradox as mr. b says but a normal paradox is solved by human an ordinary man made
    thought process. the bible is not a normal book an requires abnormal thinking to agree
    upon. the bible is a true accordn written by men of god an faith does play a gigantic role in
    understanding it. Reply
