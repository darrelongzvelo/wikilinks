Executive Chef



The Studio at Montage Laguna Beach



The Studio | 30801 S Coast Hwy | Laguna Beach, CA 92651

Studio is open Tuesday through Sunday from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Reservations may be made
calling (949) 715-6420.











Image:
http://www.atasteofdawn.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Studio2-252x300.jpg By far
one of the most exquisite resorts in Southern California is the Montage, Laguna Beach .
Basking in the breathtaking landscapes of the Pacific Ocean , this is a 5-star coastal resort
that exemplifies prestige and sophistication without being stuffy. When you pull up to the
Montage you are greeted by a palatial entry that leads into a beautiful lounge and bar that
overlook the glorious Pacific and a pool that can only be described as “grand”. If you look
just past the pool, down on the grounds below, to the right is Mosaic Bar and Grill and just below
that on a grassy nook is The Studio . The Studio is a restaurant that makes you want to inhale and
breathe in the phenomenal appeal of both beauty and intrigue. Executive Chef of The Studio is
Chef Craig Strong . The first time I met Chef Strong I had come into the restaurant rather late,
sat at the Community Table with my guest, and immediately was greeted by Tosana, the wonderful
Bartender. After ordering a cocktail, I asked if the Chef was in. To my surprise he was just in
front of me speaking to other guests. Not only does Chef ALWAYS have a smile on his face, he is one
of the most genuinely kind people I’ve ever come across. He was gracious and spoke to us as if
we were old friends and that is how is he with every guest.



Image: http://www.atasteofdawn.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Montage2.jpg After
speaking with him for a while, he inquired as to what we liked to eat and we told him we were
interested in trying the Tasting Menu he’d prepared but had a question. Were there were any
gluten-free options for the Chef’s Tasting Menu (aside from the obvious)? He smiled and
said, “we will make sure there are”. With that he excused himself and gracefully headed
back to the kitchen and soon after, a server appeared with a basket of warm bread. Chef Strong
was not only willing to adapt the tasting menu but sent out gluten-free breads that had been
gently toasted so that I could experience what any other guest would. This is only one of many
incredible moments I’ve enjoyed at The Studio thanks to Chef Strong. I have since returned
several times and now, knowing my tastes, Chef Strong continues to surprise me with his
kindness, his willingness to prepare any dish, and his love for what he does. While he is a
highly decorate chef, there is nothing pretentious or entitled about him. He is simply a
wonderful person and a very talented chef.

As I’ve gotten to know Chef, I have grown to admire him even more. During the course of one of
our conversations, I remember him telling me that his hope was to have his own herb and
vegetable garden on the property. I am pleased to say that his vision came to fruition and you
can now see several rows of stoned encased rectangular gardens plentiful in fresh
ingredients just outside of the restaurant. If you’re lucky, on occasion you’ll even get
to see a rather humorously dressed scarecrow! Chef Craig Strong of The Studio is above par in
every way from the service of his staff to his plate presentation to the integrity and sheer joy
he exude that extends into every reach of the restaurant. While it’s near impossible not to
feel as if you’ve entered a small bite of heaven at the Studio (and the Montage), the fare, the
ambiance, and the class that emits from every direction makes this an experience you must
engage in.

Thank you to Chef Craig Strong and to Lauren Crowley for making this piece possible.

Where did your passion for food begin?



At home in San Diego in our family garden. I wanted to know how our food transformed from a seed to
the delicious meals on our table.

What is your favorite childhood memory ?



First time I made apple pie with my Grandma Strong. I remember cutting the butter into the flour
with two knives.

What is your absolute favorite thing to make?



My lemon tart – delicious

http://www.atasteofdawn.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/StudioM11-199x300.jpg



When you’re at home, what is your guilty pleasure?



Cheese – I always have Triscuits and a nice selection of cheese. I also love quesadillas !

 

If you were asked to make one meal to appeal to everyone for an important dinner, what would it be
and why?



Paella – it reminds me of my time in Spain . It is the Spanish version of a BBQ, it is what the men
cook. It is a festive, fulfilling dish for a party.

How did the concept of The Studio arise?



About Studio

With a panoramic oceanfront location and modern French cuisine infused with California
influences, Studio is the portrait of beachside indulgence.

A refined and inventive menu reflects masterful attention to detail accented with an
elegant, creative touch. Since its debut in early 2003, Studio at Montage Laguna Beach has
become a culinary destination for discerning gourmets and oenophiles alike.



Image:
http://www.atasteofdawn.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/StudioM3-282x300.jpg

Set on an oceanfront bluff in the artistic village of Laguna Beach, Studio is designed to
captivate the senses. Ocean breezes, sweeping views and lush landscapes create a refreshing
sense of place at the water’s edge and a fitting backdrop for the shared enjoyment of fine
food and wine. Situated facing due west, the Craftsman-inspired restaurant – reminiscent
of an elegant yet charming beach cottage – treats guests to a striking view through
expansive doors and windows, often open to the refreshing ocean breeze.

Custom-built wine vaults flank the entryway and spotlight more than 2,500 bottles of the
restaurant’s wine collection. The unique, turn-of-the-century bar adds a sophisticated
and classic touch, while the large communal bar area offers an interactive dining experience
for sampling fine wines or small tastes from the restaurant’s award-winning kitchen. The
picturesque dining room seats up to 80 guests and perfectly captures the feeling of the
area’s early Plein Air paintings. Rich, dark browns and rustic wood beams combine with
elegant shades of cream and sand to create classic and warm dÃ©cor with modern
sensibilities. Tables are well spaced throughout the dining room to ensure an intimate
experience and are appointed with carefully selected linens, the finest Raynaud china , and
classic Riedel glassware.

For a more intimate dining experience, guests can enjoy the private dining room overlooking
the Pacific Ocean, or for the ultimate indulgence, guests can arrange to dine at the Chef’s
Table, a warmly appointed dining room adjacent to the kitchen, complete with a stone
fireplace and the interactive attention of Chef Craig Strong and his staff. Guests will
create a menu and wine pairings based on personal preference or place themselves in the hands
of the Chef to create a unique tasting menu for the evening. Guests at the Chef’s Table also
have the opportunity to watch the evening unfold in the kitchen and learn about its design,
which echoes that of a residential French country kitchen. Warm granite surfaces, tiled
floors and walls, and Craftsman-style cabinetry frame the imported focal points of this
French kitchen, including an exclusive Molteni range and Pavailler ovens .

The cuisine of Studio is Modern French with California influences. Chef Craig Strong draws
inspiration from a breadth of cultures to create succulent dishes that pay homage to the
bountiful fruits and vegetables of our region. Because of his strong relationships with

What is your vision for The Studio and beyond?



The Studio dining experience, does not have to be reserved for special occasions, it is
available for everyday occasions. Studio has a communal table and bar where you can have a full
multi-course meal, or just a light appetizer and a glass of wine. Fine dining twenty years ago
was uptight, pretentious, that doesnâ€™t fit my personality. Studio offers the
freshest ingredients, and finest service in a comfortable and beautiful oceanfront
location.

(You have created one of the most exquisite, non-pretentious, quality dining experiences in
all of Orange County. – ATOD)

Chef Craig Strong’s Bio



Chef Craig Strong joined Montage Laguna Beach as Executive Chef of Studio in June 2009. Chef
Strong, known for his modern French cuisine with California influences, developed a love for
cooking at an early age. One of eight children growing up in San Diego, he was inspired by his
mother and grandmother to first experiment with tomatoes and zucchini grown in the
family’s vegetable garden that was his to manage. At age 19, he attended L’Academie de
Cuisine near Washington, D.C., where he studied under some of the most respected chefs in the
area, including Chefs FranÃ§oise and Pascal Dinot.

Most recently, Chef Strong was Chef de Cuisine to what is now The Langham, Huntington Hotel &
Spa’s Dining Room in Pasadena, Calif. During his eight-year tenure, he was responsible for
all facets of the restaurant, including menu design and development. Under his direction,
The Dining Room became one of Los Angeles’ top destination dining venues and a showcase for
his love of pairing fine food with wine in ever-changing dishes, inventive tasting menus for
winemaker dinners and delicious special events. He and the restaurant received many
accolades, including Michelin One-star ratings in 2007 and 2008; Gourmet magazine ’60
World’s Best Hotel Dining Rooms,’ Los Angeles Times 3 Star Rating, Food & Wine ’50 Best
Hotel Restaurants’ and California Homes magazine ‘#1 Hotel Restaurant.’ Strong was
named runner-up Chef of the Year by Angeleno magazine ; was a semi finalist in the 2009 James
Beard Foundation Awards for Best Chef/Pacific.

From 1990 to 1994, Chef Strong held numerous culinary positions, including Saucier at La
Caille in Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah; the Capitol Club at Hyatt Regency , Washington,
D.C.; Sous Chef at the fine dining Glitretind Restaurant at Stein Erikson Lodge in Deer
Valley, Utah; First Assistant to Chef at the Adams Mark Hotel in Philadelphia, and then at The
Ritz-Carlton , Philadelphia, where he honed classic techniques with Asian influences. In
1995, he moved to Atlanta to work at The Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead , as Garde Manger with Chef
Guenter Seeger and then as Saucier and Tournant with Chef Joel Antunes, whose classically
trained French background added yet another international dimension to Strong’s style.

Chef Strong then moved to Europe as Sous Chef for The Newport Room at the Hotel Arts in Barcelona
, the fine dining restaurant in a property managed by Ritz-Carlton. Working in Spain added
another facet to Chef Strong’s cooking. The emphasis on olive oil, fresh seafood and the
Mediterranean climate, similar to that of Southern California, led Chef Strong to embrace
the bold flavors and rustic style of Spanish cuisine, adding the refinement of French
techniques.

The concept and overall experience of Studio is dedicated to highlighting the best this
idyllic location has to offerâ€”pristine ingredients from local purveyors,
unsurpassed views of the Pacific Ocean and an elegantly comfortable approach to the dining
experience.

Studio has most recently been recognized with Three Stars from Los Angeles Times , Five Stars
from Mobil Travel Guide , Robb Report as one of ‘America’s Finest Dining Restaurants,’
and Food & Wine magazine’s ‘Top 50 Hotel Restaurants’. Studio has also earned the
‘Best of Award of Excellence’ from Wine Spectator and is rated one of Zagat Survey’s
‘America’s Top Restaurants’.
