Samurai Champloo

Samurai Champloo
(ã‚µãƒ ãƒ©ã‚€ãƒ�ãƒ£ãƒ³ãƒ—ãƒ«ãƒŒ, Samurai
ChanpurÅ« ? ) is an anime series consisting of twenty-six episodes that began broadcasting
May 20, 2004 on Fuji Television in Japan . It was directed by Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy
Bebop fame. The show is set in a fictional version of Edo period Japan, featuring elements of
action, adventure and comedy blended with an anachronistic , predominantly hip-hop
soundtrack. Its name comes from the Okinawan word " chanpurÅ« " (e.g. goya champuru), which
means to mix or blend. Thus, the title may be translated as "Samurai Remix " or "Samurai Mashup
", keeping with the series' blended theme.



Theme: there's no running from the past. There are episodes dedicated to the characters
wrapping up earlier history, history that puts their lives at risk.

Jin is challenged by a master swordsman, named Kagetoki Kariya, who has unfinished business
with Jin relating to the death of Jin's master. It is revealed to us that Kariya attempted to
gain control of Jin's dojo and to train its adepts for the purpose of assassination. Jin
opposes this and Jin's master is ordered to kill him. Jin manages to survive the attempt on his
life, killing his master in the process. Mugen is confronted by three brothers whom he
scarred, crippled and drove insane during his days of piracy. Fuu finally meets the Sunflower
Samurai, named Seizou Kasumi, who is actually her father. We find out that the government
tailed her in order to find this man, who was once the leader of a Christian rebellion. Kasumi,
already terminally ill, is slain by Kariya. Kariya then attempts to kill Fuu. Jin, who was
thought to be dead, appears suddenly to finish the duel with Kariya. In order to defeat him, Jin
utilizes the last technique his master taught him: to allow oneself to be stabbed in order to
create an opening in an opponent's defense. Afterwards, Mugen and Jin (both severely
wounded) attempt to settle their score, but fail to do so as their swords break upon hitting one
another. Both pass out. Afterwards, they decide they've lost the will to kill each other. They
actually find out that they are very much alike and form a bond of sorts. At the very end, the
three part at a fork in the road. Fuu reveals that the coin she flipped in the first episode was
actually heads. The three then part ways and go to live out their lives.







Manga~



Samurai Champloo Volume 1

TOKYOPOP description: “In a world full of evil, a hardworking waitress, an arrogant
mercenary and a mysterious samurai meet. Through a series of misunderstandings, Fuu, Mugen
and Jin find themselves running from officials and wanted by the law. Together they form an
uneasy alliance to search for the enigmatic Sunflower Samurai. Along the way they come across
misleading characters, ninjas, assassins and a prince in disguise. Their journey proves to
be nothing less than a roller coaster ride of battles, danger, desperation and
companionship.”

Samurai Champloo Volume 2

TOKYOPOP description: “When rumors of a mysterious figure with a vendetta against
samurais start to spread, Mugen and Jin volunteer to take care of the killer before the body
count rises any further. But after a grueling, explosive battle, they discover that the
samurai killer is on a mission of his own--to collect the swords of a thousand defeated
warriors! Could this vicious swordsman be the link to the elusive Sunflower Samurai?"



Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked is a beat 'em up game for Playstation 2 . It has an original story
based on the anime series Samurai Champloo though Bandai has stated it has no relation to the
show.



The playable characters are Jin and Mugen. Upon the completion of the game, a third
“secret” character is made available. The game includes the original three characters:
Mugen , Jin , and Fuu . Mugen(ãƒ ã‚²ãƒ³),ã€€is the group's wild card who is
not to be underestimated. He has a sword style all his own which incorporates Capoeira
techniques. Mugen has little tact and is easily swayed by food, booze, or women. His speed and
ability along with his care free attitude and short temper make Mugen a force to be reckoned
with. Jin(ã‚žãƒ³),ã€€who is known quite well for his tremendous skill with the
style he uses, which he learned from his former Sensei, Mariya Enshirou of the Mujushin
Kenjutsu Dojo, one of the few master swordsmen. Jin is calm, cool, and he keeps his wits about
him. As most traditional samurai, Jin has two swords by his side at all times. He is more likely
to part with a comrade than his swords. Jin is gentle but when he unsheathes his sword there is no
greater force in the land. Fuu(ãƒ•ã‚Š), unlike both of the boys, is cheerful and a
quite colorful person. She's indecisive, stubborn and has no greater joy than eating until
she's as fat as a cow. She's spunky, brave, and compassionate. She never thinks twice about
helping a stranger in need, even if that stranger stole her money pouch earlier in the day.
Worso Tsurumaki, Worso is the secret character that is unlockable after you beat both Mugen
and Jin's stories
