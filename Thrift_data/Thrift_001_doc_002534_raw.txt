"It may not be an artistic masterpiece," said the maker of the UEFA Champions League Trophy,
"but everybody in football is keen to get their hands on it."

The adidas Starball has been synonymous with the UEFA Champions League since its
introduction, with FC Bayern MÃŒnchen's 2001 victory against Valencia CF in Milan the
first final to be contested using one of the iconic balls.







Those early balls were hand-stitched, but technology has evolved season on season since
then, with the 2004 Finale ball, launched ahead of the 2004 UEFA Champions League final in
Gelsenkirchen, representing a major breakthrough; the 32-panel ball adopted the Roteiro
construction and, in a break with tradition, used thermal bonding technology, rather than
being hand-stitched.







Balls launched for UEFA Champions League finals were originally used in standard
competition the following season - with the Starball being a different colour for most
campaigns. However, a new tradition began in 2006 with the launch of the Finale Paris - the
first ball that was designed specifically for the final, to be used exclusively by the
eventual winners for the following season.







Thermal bonded, like all subsequent final balls, the Finale Paris represented a break with
design tradition, pioneering a new 14-panel design making the ball rounder, smoother and
thus easier to control than any previous ball.







The Finale 7, used for the Athens final of 2007, further honed these developments, with 2008's
Finale 8 ball used in Moscow introducing the new PSC-Texture, with the dimpled surface
further enhancing control. Innovation continued with the Finale Rome for the 2009 decider.
Like previous final balls, it incorporated elements of the related to the final's branding
and was marked with the location of the crucial game.







The launch of the Finale Madrid marked the ten-year anniversary of adidas as the official
match ball supplier of the UEFA Champions League. It was therefore fitting that this ball
introduced yet another chapter in the development of ball technology.







Under the motto "design becomes technology" adidas succeeded in adjusting the technology of
the ball to a star-panel design, making the adidas Finale ball and UEFA Champions League logo
inseparable and providing the truest possible ball flight.







The adidas Finale 10, the official ball for the 2010/11 UEFA Champions League, retains the
materials and technology of the previous edition, with the iconic star panels decorated in
classic UEFA Champions League colours.







As official supplier of the UEFA Champions League, adidas will continue to bring the best
technological and design features to future balls, creating a new Starball for every season
of the competition as well as a special ball for every final. Diposkan oleh

Match Reports











It is now 14 goals without reply from three games as the strong start continues.







The Blues were afforded the luxury of a missed Frank Lampard penalty before Florent Malouda
opened the scoring for the third game running, again with a right-foot finish.







Chelsea then hit the bar, a feat also performed by Stoke with the score still 1-0. Didier Drogba
sealed the win from the penalty spot with quarter-of-an-hour to go, followed soon after by a
debut for Ramires.







This was never the fireworks of the last home game versus West Brom, or the second half at Wigan.
Stoke showed limited ambition and kept players massed at the back. Kenywne Jones up front
looked a man just back from injury.











Carlo Ancelotti was able to field a settled side, just one change forced upon him by Branislav
Ivanovic's back injury. Paulo Ferreira came in. It was in fact the same side that started the
first game of the season, here at the Bridge two weeks ago.







We've already seen John Mikel Obi create a goal with his long passing this season and he almost
did so again on four minutes, sliding one out to a flying Ashley Cole who shot across goal and
just wide.







On seven minutes Stoke midfielder Dean Whitehead linked with Jones and shot powerfully at
Petr Cech who gathered at the second attempt. Then Walters lobbed onto the roof of the net after
Etherington had got the better of Ferreira and crossed. That was a genuine scare.







Nerves should have been settled three minutes later when Stoke skipper Shawcross brought
down Malouda in the box but Lampard's poor run from the penalty spot continued. He hit it low but
too close to Sorensen who saved. That is three in a row spurned for club and country.















In fact Drogba tested the keeper more with a 30-yard free-kick soon after that was beaten away
by Sorensen's stinging fists.







The Ivorian later couldn't work the ball away from his feet for an effective shot after Michael
Essien had played it through. Essien himself then headed over a corner.







Approaching the half-hour, Chelsea began to put pressure on, winning a succession of corners
but the tall Stoke defence stood strong. They were finally ripped apart by Chelsea's
counter-attacking play 31 minutes in.







The defence pounced as Jones tried to hold the ball up, Terry and Alex snapping into the
challenge.







The captain snaffled up the loose ball and raced away before slipping the perfect pass on to
Malouda for an emphatic finish.















Cole almost made it a rapid 2-0 when he swivelled on Drogba's high ball in to rap the crossbar
with a shot. Cole was then the recipient of a nasty sliding challenge which earned Whitehead a
booking.







Our left-back was forward again just before the break, almost teeing up Drogba, and when the
ball was played back in by Anelka, Lampard volleyed over.







Etherington became the game's second booking just before the interval for tripping a
fast-breaking Anelka. Chelsea may have been the home side, but Stoke were looking vulnerable
to us on the counter-attack.



















Drogba was guilty of passing up a chance he normally buries just four minutes after the
restart. Anelka looped a cross onto his forehead but from just eight yards out he nodded it
straight at the keeper.







There was better work from the man with the Golden Boot in his own penalty area soon after as he
blocked an Etherington shot following Cech's fist away.







Stoke by this time had made a change through injury, Glenn Whelan now on for Whitehead.







The game fell into the doldrums. Chelsea's tempo was slow and Terry took a bash sliding into a
50-50 in the Stoke half. He was clearly troubled as he played on.







Whelan then hit the bar for Stoke having advanced into a big gap after Anelka lost the ball, the
25-yard effort rebounding back with Cech struggling. That was one strike of the woodwork
each.







Salomon Kalou replaced Lampard on 71 minutes, Malouda dropping back into the deeper midfield
role he played at the close of last season.







On 75 minutes came the game-clinching foul. The Blues broke out once again through Anelka and
as he beat Sorensen to the ball, the keeper brought him down. The Frenchman had been heading
wide of the goal which saved Sorensen a card, and Lampard's substitution saved a decision over
whether he should take the penalty. Drogba powered it in.















Alex did his bit to preserve the season's clean sheet with an excellent challenge in Chelsea's
area, met by a high-volume singing of the Brazilian's name.







Another Brazilian, Ramires, was met with an equally-loud cheer when he made his debut with
seven minutes of the 90 left. Essien made way.







Sturridge had also come on for Anelka and shot across the face of goal before the end and also
smashed one from distance into Sorensen's midriff.







Kalou should have made it 3-0 with normal time up having bustled through the challenge of the
last defender but one-on-one with Sorensen, he couldn't finish.











Chelsea (4-3-3): Cech; Ferreira , Alex, Terry (c), Cole; Essien (Ramires 84), Mikel, Lampard
(Kalou 71); Anelka (Sturridge 80), Drogba, Malouda.

Roman Abramovich    

  A spokesperson for Roman Abramovich has denied the billionaire is behind a takeover of
Eredivisie outfit Vitesse.



Georgian businessman Merab Jordania had apparently taken over the Dutch side, but Quote had
suggested that Abramovich was in fact facilitating the deal.



However, that information is incorrect as a representative of the Chelsea owner from his
private investment company Millhouse LLC explained that the report run by the financial
magazine was "based on anonymous sources" and "misinformed", adding that the 43-year-old is
"not involved".



Vitesse have struggled during these tougher economic times, selling off a majority of their
stars over the last few season and building a team based on youth. Diposkan oleh

Cape Town - Defending English Premiership champions Chelsea are looking to bolster their
squad ahead of the transfer market deadline on August 31.



Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti has fuelled speculation that he may be preparing a bid for
Everton midfielder Jack Rodwell after he picked out the 19-year-old for praise, according to
the Daily Mail website .



The Everton midfielder has been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge in the past with reports
that a £16m bid had been turned down last year.



The Blues are also planning a move for Real Madrid midfielder Rafael Van der Vaart and are
refusing to give up in their pursuit of Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic.

stadium terindah..



Stamford Bridge Stadium



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mitEPGK03V8/SnEIsZrtDZI/AAAAAAAAAHw/yML7hCaZcpg/s320/chelsea+fc.jpg
S tamford Bridge  adalah stadion sepak bola yang terletak di kota London. Stamford Bridge
merupakan kandang dari klub kaya raya Chelsea Football Club. Dinamai "The Bridge" oleh
penggemar klub tersebut.





Berdiri: 1905

Alamat : Stamford Bridge, London SW6 1HS England

Telpon : 0870 300 1212

Ketua : Roman Abramovich

Stadion: Stamford Bridge





Beberapa nama yang sempat menjadi calon bagi klub ini adalah Stamford Bridge FC, Kensington
FC, dan London FC hingga akhirnya Chelsea FC menjadi pilihan tetap.



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mitEPGK03V8/SnEI5rclDgI/AAAAAAAAAH4/6DIzVzRuInU/s320/Stamford+Bridge.GIF



Chelsea bermarkas di stadion Stamford Bridge yang secara resmi dibuka pada 28 Apri l 1877.
Stadion tersebut dirancang oleh arsitek asal Skotlandia Archibald Leitch yang juga
merancang banyak stadion sepakbola lain di Inggris seperti Old Trafford (Manchester
United), Celtic Park (Glasgow Celtic), Anfield (Liverpool), dan White Hart Lane (Tottenham
Hotspur). Tadinya kapasitas awal Stamford Bridge dapat menampung 100 ribu penonton dan
akhirnya mengalami berbagai perubahan hingga kapasitas akhir bagi 42.055 penonton
sekarang

































Old Trafford Stadium



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mitEPGK03V8/Sm1Ot7QFDcI/AAAAAAAAAHg/BneriZFobcs/s320/Manchester+United.jpg
Old Trafford adalah sebuah stadion sepak bola di kota Stretford, Trafford, Manchester,
Inggris. Stadion Old Trafford merupakan kandang dari klub Manchester United F.C.





Sir Bobby Charlton memberikan julukan Old Trafford sebagai The Theatre of Dreams. Lapangan
ini menjadi permanen milik Manchester United F.C. sejak 1910 (sempat absen pada tahun
1941-1949 karena dibom saat Perang Dunia Kedua).





Stadion ini terletak kira-kira setengah mil dari Lapangan Kriket Old Trafford dan
Manchester Metrolink. Old Trafford sering dipakai menjadi tuan rumah pertandingan
semi-final Piala FA (sebagai tempat netral), dan sebagai markas tim nasional sepak sepak
bola Inggris ketika Stadion Wembley dalam proses renovasi. Stadion Old Trafford juga
menjadi salah satu tempat pertandingan pada piala dunia 1966 dan Euro 1996. Dengan
terpilihnya london sebagai tuan rumah olimpiade 2012, stadion ini direncanakan untuk
beberapa pertandingan penyisihan sepak bola pria dan wanita.



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mitEPGK03V8/Sm5sUmjLYkI/AAAAAAAAAHo/oo3E6zpSzgk/s320/Manchester+United.jpg
Old Trafford memiliki kapasitas 76.000, dan menjadi satu-satunya stadion di Inggris yang
memiliki rating 5 bintang. Namun, dalam 3 - 4 tahun mendatang stadion ini tidak akan menjadi
markas dari  Inggris  karena akan adanya penilaian penentuan rating bintang oleh UEFA
dalam 3 - 4 tahun mendatang dan kemungkinan besar stadion Wembley akan mendapatkan rating 5
bintang karena oleh beberapa media dianggap layak memenuhi syarat stadion 5 bintang UEFA

Santiago Bernabeu

Spanyol baru saja meraih gelar kedua mereka dengan menjuarai piala eropa 2008. Sedangkan di
pentas piala dunia, Spanyol belum pernah merengkuh gelar di pentas Piala Dunia. Namun,
Negeri Matador itu punya sumbangsih besar dalam perjalanan sejarah Piala Dunia. Sumbangsih
itu berupa Stadion Santiago Bernabeu.



Sejarah stadion Santiago Bernabeu memang tak bisa dipisahkan dengan perjalanan Real
Madrid, klub raksasa di pentas Liga Spanyol. Santiago Bernabeu berdiri seiring pesatnya
prestasi dan fanatisme publik pada El Real. Real Madrid sendiri berdiri pada 1902. Saat
pertama kali eksis di pentas Liga Spanyol, Real tak memiliki stadion yang representatif.
Mereka hanya memanfaatkan stadion kecil bernama Campo de O'Donnel yang hanya memiliki
kapasitas 8.000 penonton. Sebelas tahun Real memanfaatkan Campo de O'Donnel. Pada 1912,
mereka hijrah ke komplek stadion yang lebih luas di Estadio de Chamartin. Real resmi memakai
Estadio de Chamartin sejak 17 Mei 1923 yang sekaligus menandai gelar pertama Real di pentas
Liga Spanyol. Laga pembuka pemakaian Estadio de Chamartin ditandai dengan laga lawan
Newcastle United yang disaksikan 22.500 suporter. Seiring perjalanan waktu, prestasi Real
semakin membaik. Dukungan publik pun terus melimpah. Ini yang kemudian memunculkan gagasan
pada Don Santiago Bernabeu, yang terpilih sebagai presiden Real pada 1943, untuk merenovasi
Estadio de Chamartin. Bernabeu melihat, Estadio de Chamartin tak cukup untuk menampung
luapan pendukung yang ingin melihat langsung penampilan tim kesayangan mereka di lapangan.



"Ini bukan ambisi pribadi saya. Tapi, ambisi klub dan pendukungnya. Real klub besar. Kami
butuh stadion yang megah sebagai representasi kebesaran Real Madrid," papar Bernabeu
kepada situs resmi Real.



Ucapan Bernabeu seolah titah yang tak boleh dibantah. Setelah dana terkumpul sebanyak 3 juta
pesetas (sekitar USD20 Ribu atau Rp184 Juta) untuk pembangunan lapangan, serta 37 juta
pesetas (USD 275 Ribu atau Rp2,5 M) untuk pembangunan fisik stadion, pada 17 Oktober 1944
peletakan batu pertama yang menandai renovasi total Estadio de Chamartin dimulai.



Sebagai desainer, pengurus Real menunjuk dua arsitek Luis Alemany Soler dan Manuel Munoz
Monasterio. Setelah tiga tahun berjalan, wajah baru Estadio de Chamartin yang awalnya hanya
sebuah stadion kecil dengan model bangunan yang kaku, berubah menjadi stadion yang lebih
modern. Daya tampungnya juga lebih luas, yakni mencapai 73.300. Pada awal Desember 1947,
stadion dinyatakan siap pakai. Untuk menunjukkan bahwa stadion sudah layak pakai, pada 14
Desember 1947, digelar laga pembukaan antara Real Madrid menjamu klub Portugal, OS
Belenenses. Laga tersebut dimenangkan Real 3-1. Sabino Barinaga tercatat sebagai pencetak
gol pertama di stadion baru Real. Nah, untuk menghargai ide besar Santiago Bernabeu, sejak 4
Januari 1955, stadion tak lagi memakai nama Estadio de Chamartin. Nama itu berubah menjadi
Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.



Seiring perkembangan zaman, stadion sempat beberapa kali direnovasi. Daya tampung terus
diperluas. Bahkan, pernah mencapai 120.000. Namun, daya tampung kembali diperkecil
menjadi 80.000 karena terbentur regulasi baru UEFA musim 1998-1999 soal kapasitas stadion
yang tak boleh lebih dari 100.000.

yang namanya diambil dari nama Presiden FC Madrid tersebut untuk pertama-kalinya dibangun
pada 27 Oktober 1944.

match report chelsea vs west brom



MATCH REPORT: CHELSEA 6 WEST BROMWICH ALBION 0

Posted on: Sat 14 Aug 2010 A  Didier Drogba  hat-trick,  Frank Lampard  among the
goals, a mighty home win and Chelsea on top of the table. No it is not a reposting of the report
from the final league game of last season, but happily the first one of this campaign. Just six
minutes of league football was played by Chelsea since the final goal against Wigan back in May
and  Florent Malouda  netting the first against West Brom at the Bridge today. The dodgy
pre-season results were quickly forgotten and although the rest of the play between that
Malouda strike and Drogba's first goal just before the interval was a little uninspiring, in
the second half the Blues put the ragged Baggies to the sword, Drogba scoring a further two,
Lampard opening his account for the season and Malouda wrapping up the match as he began it when
he netted his second. The afternoon had begun with good news with Lampard declared over his
injury suffered on duty with England and he was named in the starting line up, as were  Petr
Cech  and Alex whose recoveries came just in time for the 'big kick-off'.

Image: http://www.chelseafc.com/javaImages/e1/eb/0,,10268~8973281,00.jpg Didier
Drogba  was also handed a start following his appearance off the bench in the Community
Shield. Paulo Ferreira  was rewarded for his pre-season form by retaining the right-back
shirt so  Branislav Ivanovic  dropped to the bench.  Salomon Kalou  made space for
Drogba in the front three with  Nicolas Anelka  moving wide right. Before kick-off there
was the expected and totally deserved warm reception for Chelsea cup final heroes Roberto Di
Matteo and Eddie Newton (their manager in 1997, Ruud Gullit, was an on-pitch guest at
half-time to similar applause). The first shot of the game was from Di Matteo's team - sliced
well wide by Morrison. Anelka was the first to let fly for Chelsea - his on target but straight at
Carson. That was on three minutes and less than two minutes later the former England keeper
made a double save but still could not prevent Malouda from opening his account for 2010/11. It
was the same Frenchman who initially won a free-kick in a central position when his run was
blocked by Ibanez. Di Matteo's hopes that his side could survive an early storm on the pitch as
the rain poured down from above evaporated when Drogba's attempt was pushed out to Mikel and
although Carson intervened again, the ball fell to Malouda just two yards out. The chance was
unmissable. Cole, a persistent attacking presence in the early stages, flashed a dangerous
ball across the area soon after before Cech made his first save to keep out Dorran's deflected
shot. Bednar had the ball in the net for West Brom on 18 minutes but the Baggies' lone striker was
offside when receiving the ball. The biggest supply of danger in the midway part of the first
half was from the two keepers - both escaping when under-hitting clearances. Chelsea were
failing to follow up strongly on the good start. With Malouda and Anelka tucked in behind
Drogba - the shape looking more Yuletide decoration than genuine 4-3-3 -  Stamford Bridge
 was looking a very congested pitch. On 34 minutes Cole showed he is far more than just an
attacking instrument in a narrow game when he was back with a timely intervention when West
Brom threatened a break with Bedner found quickly. Then the game became the  Florent Malouda
 show for a four-minute period.

Image: http://www.chelseafc.com/javaImages/e4/eb/0,,10268~8973284,00.jpg First he
crashed a shot against the post as the flag was going up - a tight offside call. Then the number 15
was almost the beneficiary of an expertly-executed Lampard back heel but was strongly
resisted by Jara's challenge. Then Drogba was dumped to the turf and this time Lampard stung
Carson's hands with a free-kick. It came Malouda's way once more but this time the opening
goalscorer headed over. Right on the stroke of half-time came Chelsea's third free-kick
within shooting range. The rotation put Drogba back on strike and it was third time lucky for
the Blues as West Brom's wall let Carson down badly by letting the ball straight through,
giving the keeper no chance of making it. The ball flew just inside the right-hand post at the
Shed End. Last season's Golden Boot winner was off and running.

Image: http://www.chelseafc.com/javaImages/df/eb/0,,10268~8973279,00.jpg There was
a spot of good fortune six minutes into the second half when Dorrans' deflected shot dropped a
couple of yards wide after Ferreira had been caught in possession. Cech would have struggled
had it been on target. Any chance of West Brom getting back into the game was ended soon after
when Drogba netted his second, gobbling up his chance from inside the six-yard box when West
Brom missed their chance to clear, a Terry header having been stopped on the line. That made it
3-0. With our run of good opening day results now certain to continue, Ancelotti began to
change his team - Ivanovic coming on for Ferreira shortly after the right-back had collected
the game's only booking. Benyoun would soon follow on to the pitch for his home debut but not
before goal number four. A Chelsea hatful without a Lampard goal is always unlikely and this
was not to be such an occasion. Lamps took Cole's square pass after Anelka had made an incision
and wrong-footed Carson before rolling the ball home. Drogba completed his hat-trick on 67
minutes when he both tried and received his luck with a shot from 25 yards out - the ball taking a
heavy deflection off Tamas on its way into the net. Now one of the major tasks remaining was to
preserve a clean sheet that an all-round solid defensive display deserved. Alex did his bit
with a headed deflection on a shot with five minutes remaining, and then substitute Cox shot
wide when well placed. Then on 89 minutes at the other end a France combination ended the day -
Malouda taking Anelka's beautifully-judged pass on the right and finishing off the inside of
the post.

Image: http://www.chelseafc.com/javaImages/d8/eb/0,,10268~8973272,00.jpg Chelsea

CHELSEA HISTORY



For information on the current season, see  Chelsea F.C. season 2009–10 . This article
documents the  History of  Chelsea Football Club , an English  association football
 team based in Fulham, West London. For a general overview of the club, see  Chelsea F.C.
Founded in 1905, Chelsea quickly gained a reputation for signing big name players and for
attracting large crowds, but failed to win a major trophy in their first fifty years. They
spent thirty of their first forty seasons in the First Division, although often found
themselves finishing in mid-table or battling relegation. The closest Chelsea came to
success was in the  FA Cup ; they were runners-up in  1915  and losing semi-finalists in
1911, 1920, 1932, 1950 and 1952. The duck was finally broken by manager  Ted Drake , who
introduced a series of changes at the club and led Chelsea to the league championship in  1955
. The period 1963–72 saw Chelsea regularly challenge for honours for the first time,
although they often narrowly missed out. The  League Cup  was won in  1965 , the FA Cup in 
1970  and the  UEFA Cup Winners' Cup  in  1971 ; they were also FA Cup runners-up in  1967
 and League Cup runners-up in  1972 . Several problems over the next decade, principally
the debt burden caused by an ambitious attempt to redevelop Stamford Bridge, brought the club
to the brink of extinction, before a revival under  John Neal  in the mid-1980s saw the club
win the  Second Division  title and ultimately re-establish itself in the top flight. A
further revival under managers  Ruud Gullit  and  Gianluca Vialli  from 1996–2000
saw Chelsea win the FA Cup in  1997  and  2000 , the League Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in
1998, and qualify for the Champions League for the first time; the club have not finished
outside of the top six in the Premier League since the  1995–96  season. In 2003, Chelsea
were bought by Russian billionaire  Roman Abramovich , ushering in the club's current phase
of success.  JosÃ© Mourinho  led them to two league titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups in
three seasons. The club added a further FA Cup in  2009 , a league and FA Cup " Double " in 2010 and
reached their first UEFA Champions League final in  2008 .

File:Cfcpensioner.png Chelsea's first  crest In 1896,  Henry Augustus "Gus" Mears ,
football enthusiast and businessman, along with his brother,  Joseph Mears , purchased
the  Stamford Bridge Athletics Ground  in  Fulham , West London, with the intention of
staging first-class  football  matches there, though they had to wait until 1904 to buy the
freehold, when the previous owner died. They failed to persuade  Fulham Football Club  to
adopt the ground as their home after a dispute over the rent, so Mears considered selling to
the  Great Western Railway Company , who wanted to use the land as a  coal -dumping yard.
Mears' colleague Fred Parker was trying unsuccessfully to dissuade him. Parker later
recounted what happened next: Feeling sad that the old ground would be no more, I walked slowly
by his [Mears'] side when his dog, coming up from behind unobserved, bit me so severely through
my cycling stockings as to draw blood freely. On telling the owner "Your damned dog has bitten
me, look!" and showing him the blood, instead of expressing concern he casually observed,
"Scotch terrier; always bites before he speaks." The utter absurdity of the remark struck me
as so genuinely funny that although hopping about on one foot and feeling blood trickling
down, I had to laugh heartily and tell him he was the "coolest fish" I'd ever met. A minute later
he surprised me by slapping me on the shoulder and saying, "You took that bite damned well, most
men would have kicked up hell about it. Look here, I'll stand on you; never mind the others. Go to
the chemists and get that bite seen to and meet me here at nine tomorrow morning and we'll get
busy". [ 1 ] Thus on a whim, Mears changed his mind and decided to take Parker's advice to instead
found his own football club to occupy Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea's squad in 1905 Chelsea Football Club were founded on 10 March 1905 [ 2 ]  at The Rising
Sun pub, (now The Butcher's Hook) opposite today's main entrance to the ground on the Fulham
Road. Since there was already a team named Fulham in the  borough , the name of the adjacent
borough, the  Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea , was settled on after  London FC , 
Kensington FC  and  Stamford Bridge FC  had been rejected. [ 3 ]  Blue shirts were adopted
by Mears, after the  racing  colors of  Lord Chelsea , along with white shorts  and dark
blue  socks . Chelsea were denied entry to the  Southern League  following objections
from Fulham and  Tottenham Hotspur , so instead applied for admission to the  Football
League . Their candidacy was endorsed at the Football League  AGM  on 29 May 1905, with a
speech by Parker, which emphasised the new club's financial stability and its impressive new
stadium and team playing an important part. Scottish international half-back  John
Robertson  was hired as the club's first player-manager. The club began with established
players recruited from other teams, such as 22 stone goalkeeper  William "Fatty" Foulke ,
who was an  FA Cup  winner with  Sheffield United , and inside forward  Jimmy Windridge
 who came from  Small Heath . Chelsea's first league match took place away at  Stockport
County  on 2 September 1905. They lost the game 1–0. [ 4 ]  Their first home match was
against Liverpool  in a friendly. They won 4–0. Robertson also scored Chelsea's first
competitive goal, in a 1–0 win against  Blackpool . [ 5 ] Chelsea finished a respectable 3rd
in the  Second Division  in their first season, but Robertson steadily saw his position
undermined by board room interference. He lost the power to select the team in November 1906,
and by January 1907 he had left for  Glossop . [ 6 ]  Club secretary  William Lewis  took
temporary charge and led the team to promotion at the end of the season, thanks largely to the
goals of Windridge and  George "Gatling Gun" Hilsdon . The latter was the first of many
prolific strikers/forwards to play for Chelsea; he scored five goals on his debut and 27 in the
promotion season en route to becoming the first player to score 100 goals for the club.

Chelsea beat West Brom at  Stamford Bridge  in September 1905 Lewis was succeeded by 
David Calderhead , who was to manage Chelsea for the next 26 years. The club's early seasons
produced little success, and they yo-yoed between the First and Second divisions. They were
relegated in  1909–10 , promoted in  1911–12  and finished second-bottom in 
1914–15 , the final competitive season before football in England was abandoned owing to
World War I. The club would normally have been relegated, but the league was expanded after the
war, and Chelsea were invited to re-join the First Division. In spite of their checkered
fortunes, Chelsea became one of the best-supported teams in the country, with fans attracted
by the team's reputation for playing entertaining attacking football and for signing star
players, notably defensive back  Ben Warren  and striker  Bob Whittingham . 67,000
people attended a league game against  Manchester United  on Good Friday 1906, a
then-record for a football match in London. [ 7 ]  55,000 attended the first-ever  London
derby  in the top division, against  Woolwich Arsenal , a record for a First Division match.
77,952 attended a fourth round FA Cup tie against Swindon on 13 April 1911. In 1915, under the
shadow of the First World War, Chelsea reached their first  FA Cup  final, the so-called 
"Khaki" cup final , owing to the large number of uniformed  soldiers  in attendance. The
match against Sheffield United was played in a sombre atmosphere and staged at  Old Trafford
 in  Manchester  to avoid disruption in London. Chelsea, minus their top amateur
striker, Vivian Woodward , who had sportingly insisted that the team who reached the final
ought to keep their places, were seemingly unnerved by the occasion and outplayed for much of
the match. Goalkeeper  Jim Molyneux 's mistake allowed United to score before half-time,
but the Blues held out until the final six minutes, when their opponents added two more to win
3–0.

[ edit ] Between the wars

1919–20 , the first full season following the war, was Chelsea's most successful up to that
point. Led by 24 goal striker  Jack Cock , the club's latest glamour signing, they finished
3rd in the league – then the highest league finish for a London club – and reached the FA Cup
semi-finals, only to be denied by eventual winners  Aston Villa , which saw them miss out on a
chance to play in the final at  Stamford Bridge . The club were relegated again in  1923–24
 and in four of the next five seasons were to narrowly miss out on promotion, finishing 5th,
3rd, 4th and 3rd. With long serving mainstays including  Willie Ferguson ,  Tommy Law
 and  Andy Wilson , Chelsea finally reached the First Division again in  1929–30 , where
the club was to remain for the next 32 years. To capitalise on the 1930 promotion, the club spent
£25,000 ($49,000) on three big-name players; Scots  Hughie Gallacher ,  Alex Jackson
 and  Alec Cheyne . Gallacher in particular was one of the biggest talents of his era, known
for his goalscoring and for having captained Newcastle to a championship in  1926–27 . He
and Jackson had also been members of the Wembley Wizards  team (as had Law), the Scotland team
which beat England 5–1 at Wembley in 1928. However, though the team occasionally clicked,
such as in a 6–2 win over  Manchester United  and a 5–0 win over  Sunderland , none of the
trio had the desired impact. Gallacher was Chelsea's top scorer in each of his four seasons,
scoring 81 goals in total, but his time in west  London  was hindered by his personal
troubles and punctuated by long suspensions for indiscipline, including a two month ban for
swearing at a referee. [ 8 ]  Jackson and Cheyne struggled to settle at the club and were unable
re-capture their previous achievements. The trio didn't make 300 appearances between them
and by 1936 all had left at a significant financial loss to the club. [ 9 ]  Their
disappointment epitomised Chelsea's flaws throughout the decade, whereby performances
and results rarely matched the calibre of players at the club. Money was spent, but some feel it
was too often spent on inappropriate players, especially forwards, while the defence
remained neglected. The FA Cup was to be the closest the club came to silverware. In 1932, the
team secured impressive wins over  Liverpool  and  Sheffield Wednesday , and were drawn
against Newcastle United in the semi-finals.  Tommy Lang  inspired Newcastle to a 2–0
lead, before Gallacher pulled one back for Chelsea. The Blues laid siege to the United goal in
the second half, but were unable to make a breakthrough and the Geordies went on to lift the
trophy. Calderhead stepped down in 1933 and was replaced by  Leslie Knighton , but the
appointment saw little change in Chelsea's fortunes. At different times during the decade
the club had on its books such players as  Tommy Law ,  Sam Weaver ,  Syd Bishop ,  Harry
Burgess ,  Dick Spence  and  Joe Bambrick , all established internationals, yet their
highest league finish in the decade was 8th. Ironically, two of the club's most reliable
players during the decade cost them nothing: goalkeeper  Vic Woodley , who was to win 19
consecutive caps for England, and centre-forward  George Mills , the first player to score
100 league goals for Chelsea. They avoided relegation by two points in  1932–33  and 
1933–34 , and by one point in  1938–39 . Another promising cup run in 1939, which included
wins over Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday, petered out with a home loss to  Grimsby Town  in
the quarter-finals. The club continued to be one of the country's best-supported teams. The
visit of Arsenal on 12 October 1935 attracted a crowd 82,905 to Stamford Bridge, which remains
a club record and the second highest ever attendance at an English league match. Crowds of
almost 50,000 attended Gallacher and Jackson's home debuts. In 1939, with the club having
come no closer to on-field success, Knighton stepped down. He was succeeded by Scotsman and
former  Queens Park Rangers  manager,  Billy Birrell .

[ edit ] The War, Dynamo and the new youth system (1940–52)

Birrell was appointed Chelsea manager shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.
Three games into the  1939–40  season, first class football was abandoned in Britain for
the duration of the conflict, meaning that all wartime results are only regarded as
unofficial. Chelsea competed in a series of regional competitions and, like every other
club, saw their squad severely depleted by the war effort (only two members of Chelsea's 
1938–39  team ever played for them again). The club thus fielded a series of "guest"
players, most notably  Matt Busby , Walter Winterbottom  and  Eddie Hapgood . They also
competed in the  Football League War Cup , during which they made their  Wembley  debut,
losing 1–3 to  Charlton Athletic  in the 1944 final, and beating  Millwall  2–0 a
year later in front of crowds of over 80,000. After the latter match,  John Harris  became
the first Chelsea captain to lift a trophy at Wembley, receiving the cup from  Prime Minister
  Winston Churchill .

Moscow  at the bridge In October 1945, with the War having just ended, the English football
authorities sought a way to celebrate the return of the peace-time game. As part of a 
goodwill  gesture, it was announced that  FC Dynamo Moscow , reigning champions of the
Soviet Union, would tour the United Kingdom and play several home teams, including Chelsea.
The match took place on 13 November at Stamford Bridge with Chelsea wearing an unfamiliar red
strip due to a clash with Dynamo's blue kit. Before kick-off, the Dynamo players presented a
bouquet of flowers to their opposite number. [ 10 ]  The Russian team surprised many
observers with their talent and tenacity by fighting back from 0–2 and 2–3 down to earn a
3–3 draw. An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people attended the match, with thousands
entering the ground illegally. This crowd is the highest ever recorded at Stamford Bridge.
Spectators watched from numerous obscure places, including many on the dog track and on the
top of stands. [ 11 ] Following the war, Chelsea again spent big, and again bought three
big-name forwards, this time  Tommy Lawton ,  Len Goulden  and  Tommy Walker , for around
£22,000. The trio provided both goals and entertainment – Lawton set a new club record by
scoring 26 goals in 34 league games in  1946–47 [ 4 ]  – but Chelsea finished 15th that
season and never finished above 13th under Birrell. After a falling out with Birrell, Lawton
was sold to  Notts County  for £20,000; his replacement was  Roy Bentley , signed from 
Newcastle United  for £11,500 in 1948. 1950 saw Chelsea enjoy another run in the  FA Cup .
After beating  Manchester United  2–0 in a pulsating quarter-final, they were drawn to
face London rivals  Arsenal  at  White Hart Lane . Two goals from Bentley put Chelsea in
control, but a freak goal from Arsenal (Chelsea's goalkeeper misjudged a corner and punched
it into his own net) just before half-time turned the game. Arsenal equalised 15 minutes from
full-time and then won the replay 1–0. A year later , Chelsea seemed destined for
relegation: with four games remaining, they were six points behind, at the bottom of the
table, and without a win in fourteen matches. After unexpectedly winning the first three,
Chelsea went into their final match needing to beat  Bolton Wanderers  and hoping for the
right result between fellow relegation candidates  Everton  and Sheffield Wednesday .
Chelsea won 4–0 and Wednesday beat Everton 6–0, thus ensuring Chelsea's survival on 
goal average  by 0.044 of a goal. [ 4 ]  In 1952, Chelsea again faced Arsenal in the FA Cup
semi-finals and after a 1–1 tie in the first match, lost the replay 3–0. Birrell resigned
shortly afterwards. Birrell's biggest contribution to Chelsea was off the field. In a bid to
counter the spiraling cost of  transfer fees  in football, he oversaw the development of an
extensive new youth and scouting programme, headed by ex-players  Dickie Foss ,  Dick
Spence  and  Jimmy Thompson , which would ultimately see the club produce its own players. [
12 ]  The policy would provide the core of Chelsea's first team for the next three decades in
particular, producing such players as  Jimmy Greaves ,  Bobby Smith ,  Peter Osgood , 
Peter Bonetti ,  Ray Wilkins ,  Ron Harris , Bobby Tambling ,  Alan Hudson ,  Terry
Venables  and  John Hollins .

crest 1952–1953 In 1952, former  Arsenal  and  England  striker  Ted Drake  was
appointed manager. One of the first "tracksuit managers" who used to shake each player by the
hand and wish them "all the best" before each match, Drake proceeded to modernise the club,
both on and off the field. One of his first actions was to remove the image of a  Chelsea
pensioner  from the match programme and the club's old  nickname  was no more. From then on
they were to be known as the Blues . This also led to the introduction of a new "lion rampant"
crest. [ 13 ] He improved the training  regime , introducing ballwork to training sessions, a
practice rare in England at the time; the youth and scouting systems begun by his predecessor
were extended and he abandoned the club's old recruiting policy of signing often unreliable
stars, opting instead for lesser known but more reliable players from the lower divisions. [ 4
]  He also urged the club's fans to be more partisan and to get behind the team. [ 4 ]  Drake's
early years were unpromising, as Chelsea finished 19th and just a point away from relegation
in his first season and 8th in his second. In  1954–55 , the club's  jubilee  year,
everything clicked. The team found a consistency rate not previously there as Chelsea
unexpectedly won the  First Division  title. It included  goalkeeper   Charlie 'Chic'
Thomson , amateur players  Derek Saunders  and  Jim Lewis , central midfielder  Johnny
'Jock' McNichol , wingers  Eric "Rabbit" Parsons  and  Frank Blunstone , defender 
Peter Sillett  and future  England  manager  Ron Greenwood  in central defence, as
well old club stalwarts, right back  Ken Armstrong , left-back  Stan Willemse  and 
veteran  defender  John Harris . Perhaps the only genuine star in the side was captain ,
top-scorer (with 21 league goals) and England international  Roy Bentley .

Image: http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png
During  Ted Drake 's reign as manager, the club's old Chelsea pensioner  badge was
abandoned at his insistence in favor of this, the "Lion Rampant Regardant" Chelsea had begun
the season much as they had finished the last, with four consecutive defeats, including a
thrilling 5–6 loss to Manchester United, which left them 12th in November. From there the
team went on a remarkable run, losing just 3 of the next 25 games and secured the title with a game
to spare after a 3–0 win against  Sheffield Wednesday  on  St George's Day . Key to the
success were two league wins against principal rivals and eventual runners-up
Wolverhampton Wanderers . The first was a dramatic 4–3 win at  Molineux  – a game in
which Chelsea were trailing 2–3 going into stoppage time – and a 1–0 win at  Stamford
Bridge  in April, secured with a Sillett  penalty  awarded after Wolves captain  Billy
Wright  had punched a goal-bound shot over the bar. [ 14 ] Chelsea's points total of 52 for that
season remains one of the lowest to have secured the English League title since the First World
War. In the final game of the season, Chelsea, now champions, were given a guard of honour by 
Matt Busby 's Manchester United  Busby Babes . That same season saw the club complete a unique
quadruple, with the reserve, 'A' and junior sides also winning their respective leagues.
Winning the Championship should have ensured that Chelsea became the first English
participants in the inaugural  European Champions' Cup  competition to be staged the
following season. Indeed, they were drawn to face  Swedish champions   DjurgÃ¥rdens
 in the first round. However, Chelsea were denied by the intervention of the  Football
League  and the  F.A. , many of whose leading members were opposed to the idea and felt that
primacy should be given to domestic competitions, so the club were persuaded to withdraw. [ 15
]  Chelsea did play an unofficial UK championship  friendly  against Scottish 
champions Aberdeen , which Aberdeen won. Chelsea presented a plate with the club crest to
Aberdeen as a reward. Chelsea were unable to build on their title success, and finished a
disappointing 16th the following season. The team was aging and there followed a succession
of uninspiring mid-table finishes; one bright spot in this period was the emergence of the
prolific goalscorer  Jimmy Greaves , who scored 122 league goals in four seasons. Along with
Greaves, a series of other promising youngsters, informally known as  Drake's Ducklings ,
emerged in the first team, though their inexperience ensured that performances remained
erratic. One of the lowest points for the club in this period was being knocked out of the  FA
Cup  in the 3rd round by  Fourth Division  side,  Crewe Alexandra , in January 1961. When
Greaves was sold to  AC Milan  in June 1961 the writing was on the wall and, without his goals,
results slumped. Drake was sacked in September after a 4–0 loss to  Blackpool  with
Chelsea bottom of the league table. He was replaced by 33-year-old player-coach  Tommy
Docherty .

Tambling  and  Barry Bridges , two key players in the Chelsea side of the 1960s, pictured at
Stamford Bridge in 2009. The  swinging sixties  ushered in an era that saw football and
inimitable style merge in the heart of London; with the fashionable  King's Road  at the
heart of the swagger. Superstars of the time, including  Michael Caine ,  Steve McQueen , 
Raquel Welch ,  Terence Stamp  and  Richard Attenborough (now Life Vice President of the
club) were regularly seen at Stamford Bridge as the team became one of the most glamorous and
fashionable in the country. A 60s Chelsea side that oozed charisma and class established the
club as a big name for the first time, but ultimately failed to match its swagger with on-field
triumphs, and endured several near-misses. Docherty imposed a regime of strict discipline,
sold off many of the club's older players, and replaced them with the new generation of
talented youngsters emerging from the youth system, supplemented by some shrewd transfers.
By the time he took over in January 1962, the team were already all but doomed to relegation and
he used the time to experiment and plan for the future. Chelsea were duly relegated and in
Docherty's first full season as manager he led them back to promotion as  Second Division
 runners-up, secured with a crucial and hard-fought 1–0 win at rivals Sunderland  (and a
goal scored via  Tommy Harmer 's groin) and a 7–0 final day win over  Portsmouth . Chelsea
thus returned to the First Division with a new, youthful team which included the
uncompromising  Ron "Chopper" Harris ,  goalkeeper   Peter Bonetti , prolific
goalscoring winger  Bobby Tambling  (whose 202 goals remain a  club record ),
midfielder  John Hollins , full-back  Ken Shellito , striker Barry Bridges , winger  Bert
Murray  and  captain  and playmaker  Terry Venables , all products of the youth system.
To these, Docherty added striker George Graham , left-back  Eddie McCreadie  and elegant
defender  Marvin Hinton  for minimal fees to complete the  Diamonds  line-up –
Docherty had referred to the team as his "little diamonds" during a TV documentary and the name
stuck. [ 16 ] Chelsea finished a credible 5th in their first season back in the top-flight, and
in the next were on course for a domestic "treble" of league,  FA Cup  and  League Cup ,
playing a brand of football based on high energy and quick passing and utilising innovative
tactics – they were one of the first English teams to use overlapping full-backs. [ 17 ]
 Chelsea set the early pace and emerged in a three-way tussle for the league title with
Manchester United and  Leeds United . The  League Cup  was secured thanks to a 3–2 first
leg win against  Leicester City , with a memorable solo effort from McCreadie proving to be
the difference between the sides, and then a hard-fought 0–0 draw in the second leg at 
Filbert Street . However, cracks were also beginning to appear, as the temperamental
Docherty increasingly clashed with some of the strong personalities within the dressing
room, particularly Venables. The team were beaten by title rivals Manchester United in March
and lost 2–0 in their  FA Cup  semi-final against  Liverpool , despite going into the
latter match as favourites. They were nonetheless top with four games remaining. Docherty
then sent home eight key players (Venables, Graham, Bridges, Hollins, McCreadie, Hinton,
Murray and  Joe Fascione ) for breaking a  curfew  before a crucial match against 
Burnley . [ 18 ]  The bare bones of the team that remained, a collection of reserves and
youngsters, were beaten 6–2 as the title challenge collapsed; Chelsea eventually
finished 3rd. The following season proved equally eventful, if ultimately unsuccessful,
with Chelsea challenging in the League, the FA Cup and the  Fairs Cup . Playing a then-club
record total of 60 games in the three competitions in the days before substitutes, the team
were hit hard by the fixture pile-up. They finished 5th in the League, while in the FA Cup,
Chelsea gained revenge for their semi-final defeat by knocking-out holders Liverpool at 
Anfield  en route to another semi-final, where they were drawn to face  Sheffield
Wednesday , again at Villa Park. Favourites to reach the final, the side froze on the day and
were beaten 2–0 by the  Yorkshire  club. Their Fairs Cup run, taking in wins over  AS Roma
 (a violent encounter, during which the Chelsea team coach was ambushed by Roma fans),  TSV
1860 MÃŒnchen  and  AC Milan  (the last on the toss of a coin after the teams had finished
level), ended in a semi-final loss to  FC Barcelona . Both home sides won 2–0 and on
another  coin toss , the replay was staged at the Nou Camp , with Barca winning 5–0.
Docherty, his relationship with several players having reached breaking point, then made
the decision to break up a team with an average age of 21. Venables, Graham, Bridges and Murray
were all sold during the close-season. Scottish winger  Charlie Cooke  joined for
£72,000, as did striker  Tommy Baldwin , who arrived in part-exchange for Graham. Also
emerging from the youth set-up was a highly-rated teenage striker named  Peter Osgood .
Docherty's transfer manoeuvrings initially paid off. Chelsea, with Osgood at the heart of
the team, topped the league table in October 1966, the only unbeaten side after ten league
games. But Osgood broke his leg in a League Cup tie and the side's momentum was disrupted. To
replace Osgood, Docherty immediately signed striker  Tony Hateley  for a club record
£100,000, but Hateley's aerial game didn't suit Chelsea's style and he struggled to fit in. [
19 ]  They drifted down the league and finished 9th. The highlight of that season was reaching
the FA Cup final. En route to that final was a win over  Leeds United  in the semis, the game
widely seen [ 20 ]  as the one which kicked off the fierce rivalry between the two clubs. In his
finest moment for Chelsea, Hateley headed in what proved to be the winner, but in a
hotly-contested match, Leeds had two goals disallowed, one for offside and one for a  Peter
Lorimer  free-kick taken too quickly. Chelsea competed with  Tottenham Hotspur  in the
first all-London  FA Cup  final, known as the  Cockney Cup Final . It was Chelsea's first
appearance in the final since  1915  and their first ever appearance in the final at 
Wembley . In leading out the side, Ron Harris, at 22, was the youngest ever captain to take to the
field in the competition's finale. In a game which failed to match the anticipation, Chelsea
underperformed and a late Tambling header was not enough to prevent a 2–1 loss to a Spurs side
containing both Venables and  Jimmy Greaves . Docherty was sacked shortly into the next
season with the team having won only two of their opening ten games, which included a 6–2 home
loss to  Southampton , amidst rumours of dressing room unrest over bonus payments and whilst
serving a 28-day ban from football management handed out by the  FA . [ 21 ]

[ edit ] Dave Sexton

After Docherty's departure, his assistant  Ron Suart  was placed in temporary charge of
the first team. Chelsea lost their next game 7–0 against Leeds United, equalling the club's
highest-ever margin of defeat (in  1953–54 , they had lost 8–1 to Wolves).  Dave Sexton
, ex-Chelsea coach and  Leyton Orient  manager, and a character far more calm and reserved
than Docherty, was appointed manager. The core of the side inherited from Docherty remained
largely unchanged, although he added more steel to the defence with the signings of  John
Dempsey  and David Webb , as well as signing striker  Ian Hutchinson , giving mercurial
midfielder  Alan Hudson  his debut and recalling winger  Peter Houseman . Sexton proved a
stabilising influence and led Chelsea to two more top six finishes, as well as a brief foray
into the Fairs Cup in  1968–69 , where they were knocked out by  DWS Amsterdam  on a coin
toss.

Hutchinson 1970 FA Cup Final  starting lineup. In the  1969–70  season Osgood and
Hutchinson scored 53 goals between them, helping the club finish 3rd in the league and reach
another FA Cup final. This time the opponents were  Leeds United , reigning league champions
and one of the dominant sides of the era. Chelsea were generally second best in the first match
at Wembley played on a boggy pitch, but twice came from behind to gain a 2–2 draw, first
through Houseman and then a late headed equaliser (four minutes from full time) from
Hutchinson. The replay was staged at  Old Trafford  a fortnight later and is as well known
for the uncompromising tactics employed by both sides as the skill and talent on display. [ 22 ]
 Chelsea again went behind but equalised for the third time in the match with a diving header
from Osgood from a Cooke cross. As the game went into  extra time , Chelsea took the lead for the
first time when Webb headed in a Hutchinson  throw-in  to seal a  2–1 win . Winning the Cup
qualified Chelsea to play in the  UEFA Cup Winners' Cup  for the first time.
Straightforward wins over  Aris Thessaloniki  and  CSKA Sofia  took them to the
quarter-finals, where they knocked out  Club Brugge  thanks to a dramatic comeback.
Trailing 2–0 after the first leg, it took an Osgood goal nine minutes from the end of normal
time in a tense match to put Chelsea level on aggregate. They went on to win the game 4–0 after
extra time. Fellow English side (and holders)  Manchester City  were dispatched in the
semi-final. The first final match against  Real Madrid  finished 1–1 but a rare goal from
Dempsey and another strike from Osgood in the replay – played just two days later – were
enough to secure a 2–1 win and Chelsea's first European honour. The song  Blue is the Colour
 was released in 1972 with members of the squad singing, and it reached number five in the  UK
Singles Chart . [ 23 ]  The song was to become one of the most famous English football songs, and
forever associated with the Chelsea team of that  era .

[ edit ] Decline (1972–83)

The Cup Winners' Cup triumph proved to be the last of Chelsea's successes in the decade, as a
series of problems combined to almost bring the club to its knees. From the early 1970s, the
discipline of the team began to degenerate, as Sexton fell out with several key players, most
notably Osgood, Hudson and Baldwin over their attitude and lifestyle. As the spirit of the
team declined, so too did results. Chelsea set two records in defence of the Cup Winners' Cup
in  1971–72 : a 21–0 aggregate win over  Luxembourg  side  Jeunesse Hautcharage ,
which remains a record scoreline in European competition. [ 24 ]  The result included a
13–0 home win over Jeunesse, the biggest winning scoreline in Chelsea's history. However,
the team were knocked out of the competition by little-known  Ã…tvidabergs FF  under
the  away goals rule  in the next round. In the same season, Chelsea were knocked out of the FA
Cup by Second Division  Leyton Orient  despite having led 2–0, and lost in the  League
Cup final  to underdogs  Stoke City . They finished 12th in  1972–73  and 17th the
following season. The feud between Sexton and Osgood and Hudson reached its apogee after a
4–2 home defeat to  West Ham United  on  Boxing Day  1973, after Chelsea had led 2–0 at
half-time; [ 25 ]  the pair were both sold a few months later. Sexton himself was sacked early
into the  1974–75  season after a poor start, and succeeded by his assistant,  Ron Suart
, who was unable to reverse the club's decline and they were relegated in 1975. The building of
the pioneering East Stand (which retains its place even in the modern stadium) as part of a plan
to create a 60,000 all-seater stadium added to the club's woes. The project had been described
as "the most ambitious ever undertaken in Britain". [ 26 ]  It coincided with a  world
economic crisis  and was hit by delays, a builders' strike and shortages of materials, all of
which sent the cost escalating out of control, to the extent that the club's debts stood at £4m
by 1977. [ 27 ]  As a result, between August 1974 and June 1978, Chelsea were unable to buy a
single player. The decline of the team was matched by a decline in attendances – those who
remained were marred by a fierce reputation for  violence  amongst a section of the Chelsea
support (the boundary between passion and  hooliganism  being dangerously narrow in
those days). The late 1970s and the 1980s were the " golden age " of  football firms  in
England; Chelsea's own such firm, the  Chelsea Headhunters , were particularly notorious,
known for their violence and links to extremist political groups and would blight the club
throughout the following years. [ 28 ]

Image: http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png The East
Stand, one of the main causes of Chelsea's financial problems in the 1970s and 1980s Former
left-back  Eddie McCreadie  became manager shortly before Chelsea's relegation in 1975
and, after a year of consolidation in  1975–76 , led the side to promotion again in 
1976–77  with a team composed of youth players, most notably  Ray Wilkins  and 24-goal
striker  Steve Finnieston , and veterans from more successful times like Cooke, Harris and
Bonetti. But McCreadie left following a contract dispute with chairman  Brian Mears  over
a company car [ 29 ]  and another ex-player was appointed, this time former right-back  Ken
Shellito . Shellito kept Chelsea in the  First Division  in  1977–78 , though the
highlight of that season was a 4–2 win over  European  champions Liverpool in the FA Cup.
Shellito resigned midway through the following season with the club having won just three
league games by  Christmas . Even the brief return of Osgood did little to improve the club's
fortunes. Shellito's successor, former  double -winning  Tottenham Hotspur   captain
  Danny Blanchflower  was unable to stem the slump and the club were  relegated  again
with just five league wins and 27 defeats, ushering in one of the bleakest periods in Chelsea's
history. Wilkins, one of the club's few remaining stars, was sold to  Manchester United
 and  England 's  1966 World Cup final  hero  Geoff Hurst  became manager in September
1979 with  Bobby Gould  as his assistant. Their arrival saw an immediate upturn in
Chelsea's form, and for a large period Chelsea topped the Second Division table, but a late
collapse saw them finish 4th, meaning the club missed out on promotion on  goal difference .
In the next season the team struggled to score goals, going on a nine-match run without one,
winning only three matches in twenty and finishing 12th in  1980–81 . [ 30 ]  Hurst was
sacked. In 1981 Mears resigned as chairman, ending his family's 76-year association with the
club. One of Mears' last actions was to appoint former  Wrexham  boss  John Neal  as
manager. A year later,  Chelsea Football & Athletic Company , heavily in debt and unable to
pay its players, was acquired from the Mears family interests by businessman and one-time
chairman of Oldham Athletic ,  Ken Bates , for the sum of £1, though for reasons which remain
disputed, he did not buy  SB Properties , the company which now owned the Stamford Bridge
freehold. By this point, Chelsea were in a parlous financial state and losing £12,000 a week.
[ 31 ]  Bates would later describe what he took over as "a social club with a little football
played on a Saturday". [ 4 ] There were hangers-on in the wrong areas, all over the club. I wrote
everything off and started again. Chelsea used to have a bootman to clean the boots. The
apprentices just stood around watching him clean away. He went. The directors had their own
chauffeur to drive them around town. He went. Even the lottery lost money. How? There were just
two birds selling tickets. They went. [ 32 ] 1981–82 , an otherwise forgettable season
during which Chelsea again finished 12th, Chelsea went on their first significant FA Cup run
for years and drew European champions Liverpool in the fifth round. They outplayed their
illustrious opponents and won 2–0. In the quarter-finals, they were pitted against old
rivals  Tottenham Hotspur  who, in a pulsating game, won 3–2, despite Chelsea taking the
lead through  Mike Fillery . The  1982–83  season proved to be the worst in Chelsea's
history. Following a bright start, the team slumped dramatically, going on a nine-match
winless run as the season drew to a close and faced relegation to the  Third Division  which,
given the club's financial troubles, could well have dealt it a killer blow. In the
penultimate game of the season at fellow strugglers  Bolton Wanderers ,  Clive Walker
 hit a last-minute winner from 25 yards (23 m) to ensure a crucial 1–0 win. A draw at home
to Middlesbrough  in the final game ensured the club's survival by two points.

[ edit ] Battle for the Bridge

As noted above, when Bates bought Chelsea in 1982 he only bought the club and not  SB
Properties , the company which now owned the freehold of Stamford Bridge; the club and the
stadium had been separated in financial restructuring during the late 1970s. [ 33 ]  Bates
initially agreed a seven year lease, which would keep Chelsea at Stamford Bridge while its
future was decided. [ 34 ] According to Bates, he and David Mears, the majority shareholder
of  SB Properties , shook hands on a deal which would see Chelsea acquire Mears' stake in  SB
Properties  for £450,000. [ 35 ]  However, Bates later discovered that Mears was also in
discussions with  Crystal Palace  owner  Ron Noades , with a view to moving Chelsea away
from Stamford Bridge and have them ground share with Palace at  Selhurst Park . [ 36 ]  Mears
and  Lord Chelsea  subsequently sold their shares in  SB Properties  to property
developers Marler Estates, giving Marler a 70% stake. [ 35 ] Over the next decade, Bates waged a
war of attrition against Marler, acquiring a minority stake in  SB Properties  and
initiating a series of court injunctions and delaying tactics, designed to wear them down. [
37 ]  He also launched the "Save the Bridge" campaign, with the aim of raising £15m to acquire
the freehold from Marler. Marler in turn put forward several schemes which would see Chelsea
removed from Stamford Bridge. David Bulstrode, chairman of Marler, proposed a merger
between  Fulham  and  Queens Park Rangers , with Chelsea then relocating to Rangers' 
Loftus Road  stadium. In March 1986, Marler's plans to redevelop the Stamford Bridge site
without Chelsea were approved by  Hammersmith and Fulham Council ; the council reversed its
policy when the  Labour Party  gained control of it in May 1986. [ 38 ]  In December 1987, in a
"momentous decision", Bates' own plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a modern football
stadium were approved by the council's planning committee. [ 39 ] Chelsea were nonetheless
served notice to quit Stamford Bridge, upon the expiry of the lease in 1989. [ 37 ]  However,
Cabra Estates, which had purchased Marler in 1989, were eventually bankrupted in the
property market crash of 1992. This enabled Bates to do a deal with their creditors, the 
Royal Bank of Scotland , and reunite the freehold with the club. [ 40 ]  Bates then created
the  Chelsea Pitch Owners , a non-profit organisation owned by the fans which in 1997
purchased the  freehold  of the stadium, the club's  naming rights  and the pitch to
ensure that property developers could never again try to purchase Stamford Bridge.
Following this, work was begun to renovate the entire stadium (bar the East Stand), making it
all-seater and bringing the stands closer to the pitch and under cover, which was finally
completed by the  millennium .

[ edit ] Revival (1983–89)

The summer of 1983 marked a turning point in Chelsea's history. Manager  John Neal  made a
series of signings who were to be crucial in turning around the club's fortunes. In came
striker  Kerry Dixon  from  Reading , skillful winger  Pat Nevin  from  Clyde ,
midfielder  Nigel Spackman  from  Bournemouth  and  goalkeeper   Eddie Niedzwiecki
 from  Wrexham  in addition to  John Hollins  returning as player-coach, all for a
combined total of less than  £ 500,000. Dixon struck up a prolific strike partnership with
fellow Neal signing  David Speedie  and both linked up well with Nevin, a combination that
would produce almost 200 goals in three years. The new-look Chelsea began the  1983–84
 season with a 5–0 win against  Derby County  on the opening day and romped to promotion;
among the highlights were a 5–3 at  Fulham  and a 4–0 win over  Kevin Keegan 's 
Newcastle United . After a dip in form around Christmas, Neal signed winger  Mickey Thomas
 and Chelsea didn't lose another game that season. Dixon hit 36 goals in all competitions –
a seasonal tally bettered only by  Bobby Tambling  and  Jimmy Greaves  – and promotion
was sealed with another 5–0 win over old adversaries  Leeds United . The team were
crowned  Second Division  champions on the final day with a win away at  Grimsby Town , with
some 10,000 Chelsea fans making the trip to  Lincolnshire . [ 41 ] Upon their return to the 
First Division , Chelsea were unlikely European contenders in  1984–85 , eventually
finishing 6th, although the events at  Heysel  that season rendered European
qualification moot. They were also on course to reach their third  League Cup  final,
drawing relegation candidates  Sunderland  in the semi-finals. However, ex-Chelsea
winger  Clive Walker inspired his team to a 3–2 win at Stamford Bridge to seal a 5–2
aggregate win for Sunderland, which was followed by a near-riot; the game continued with 
mounted police  and supporters on the pitch, with the violence later spilling over onto the
streets. [ 42 ]  Neal retired at the end of the season due to ill health, and was replaced by
Hollins.

crest 1986–2005 In  Hollins'  first season, Chelsea challenged for the title, topping
the table in February, but long-term injuries to Dixon and Niedzwiecki, combined with a poor
run of results, especially during the  Easter  period, during which the side conceded ten
goals in two games, appeared to end their chances. A 2–1 win over  Manchester United  at 
Old Trafford  and another by the same scoreline over  West Ham  at  Upton Park  –
effectively denying the latter the title – left Chelsea three points behind leaders
Liverpool with five games remaining. One point from the remaining fixtures, however, denied
them and another 6th place finish was the result. In the same season, the inaugural  Full
Members Cup  was won with a 5–4 win over  Manchester City  at  Wembley , thanks to a
Speedie  hat-trick  and in spite of the opposition fighting back from 1–5 down.
Following this new beginning, the form of the side slumped again, finishing 14th in the next
season. The spirit of the side began to disintegrate after Hollins and his assistant  Ernie
Walley  fell out with several key players, notably Speedie and Spackman, who were
subsequently sold. [ 43 ]  Hollins was sacked in March the following season with the side
again in  relegation  trouble.  Bobby Campbell  took over in March but couldn't prevent
Chelsea's relegation via the short-lived play-off system with a loss to  Middlesbrough , a
match which was again followed by crowd trouble and an attempted pitch invasion, resulting in
a six-match closure of the terraces the following season. Nevertheless, the club bounced
back immediately and emphatically, despite failing to win any of their opening six league
games, and were promoted as Second Division champions with 99 points, 17 points clear of
nearest rivals  Manchester City .

[ edit ] The 1990s: Back On Track

Chelsea had an impressive return to the First Division in 1989–90. Campbell guided a squad
of mostly unremarkable players to a creditable fifth place in the final table. Although the
ban on English clubs in European football was lifted that year, Chelsea missed out on a  UEFA
Cup  place because the only English place in the competition that year went to league
runners-up  Aston Villa . In the same season, he led Chelsea to their second  Full Members
Cup  success, with a 1–0 win over  Middlesbrough  in the final at  Wembley . Despite
recruiting the club's first million pound players,  Dennis Wise  and  Andy Townsend , the
next season proved a disappointment, as Chelsea finished 11th in the First Division and were
knocked out of both cups by lower league opposition. Campbell was promoted to general manager
at the end of the season; he was succeeded as team manager by first team coach  Ian Porterfield
, who helped Chelsea finish high enough in 1991–92 to qualify for the first-ever season of
the  Premier League . Porterfield was sacked halfway through the  1992–93  season,
with the team having not won a league match for two months. He was replaced on a caretaker basis
by 1970 FA Cup hero,  David Webb , who steered the club clear of relegation and eventually
secured an 11th place finish. Webb was replaced by 35-year-old former England midfielder 
Glenn Hoddle , who had just won promotion to the Premiership as player-manager of  Swindon
Town . Hoddle's first season as manager saw Chelsea's league form dip slightly, and for a time
they were threatened by relegation, with the goals of  £ 1.5m signing  Mark Stein
 playing an important part in survival. In the same season Chelsea reached the  FA Cup Final
, where they faced  Premiership  champions  Manchester United , a team Chelsea had beaten
1–0 in both league games that season. After going in 0–0 at half-time, United were awarded
two second-half penalties by referee  David Elleray  in the space of five minutes, both of
which were scored. With Chelsea having to attack, it left gaps in defence and United
eventually won 4–0. This was nevertheless sufficient for Chelsea to compete in the 
1994–95 Cup Winners Cup , since United had already qualified for the Champions League. They
reached the semi-finals of that competition, going out 3–2 on aggregate to eventual
winners  Real Zaragoza . With Chelsea's future at Stamford Bridge now secure, Bates and
millionaire director  Matthew Harding  were now making money available for the club to
spend on players. In the summer of 1995, Chelsea recruited two world-famous players,  Dutch
 legend  Ruud Gullit , on a free transfer from  Sampdoria , and Manchester United
striker  Mark Hughes  (£1.5 m), both of whom would play a significant role in the club's
future success. Hoddle also signed talented  Romanian  full-back  Dan Petrescu  for
£2.3m. Hoddle guided Chelsea to another 11th place finish in 1995–96 , and another FA Cup
semi-final, and then resigned to become manager of the  England national team .

[ edit ] Renaissance: Gullit, Vialli and Zola (1996–2000)

Gianfranco Zola Gullit was appointed player-manager for the  1996–97  season, and
added several top-class players to the side, including European Cup-winning  Juventus
striker  Gianluca Vialli , cultured French defender  Frank Leboeuf  and  Italian
internationals   Gianfranco Zola  (whose skill would make him a firm favourite with the
crowd and see him become one of Chelsea's greatest ever players) and  Roberto Di Matteo
 (the latter for a club record £4,900,000). They were later joined by the powerful and
prolific  Uruguayan  midfielder  Gustavo Poyet  and  Norwegian  "super-sub" 
Tore AndrÃ© Flo . With such players, it was under Gullit and his successor that Chelsea
emerged as one of England's top sides again and gained a reputation for playing a neat,
entertaining and attractive passing game performed by technically gifted players, which
was informally dubbed "sexy football", though the club's inconsistency against supposed
"smaller" teams remained. Gullit capped an impressive first season in management by leading
Chelsea to their highest league placing since 1990 (6th) and winning the FA Cup, ending the
club's 26-year wait for a major trophy. The most memorable match of the run was a 4th round
comeback against  Liverpool , in which Chelsea, inspired by Hughes, overturned a 2–0
half-time deficit to win 4–2. The  2–0  victory over  Middlesbrough  in the final
at  Wembley  got off to a frantic start with Di Matteo scoring after 43 seconds;  Eddie
Newton 's late goal clinched it. The win was a happy end to a season which had looked to be
dominated by sadness after the death in October of popular director and financial
benefactor  Matthew Harding  in a  helicopter  crash following a League Cup match
against  Bolton Wanderers . Gullit was suddenly sacked in February 1998, ostensibly after a
contract dispute, [ 44 ]  with the team 2nd in the Premiership, and in the semi-finals of two
cup competitions. Another  player-manager  was appointed – the 33-year-old Vialli.
Vialli began his management career in style by winning two trophies in two months. The League
Cup was secured with another 2–0 win over Middlesbrough at Wembley (with Di Matteo again on
the scoresheet). Chelsea reached the  Cup Winners' Cup  final following a dramatic
semi-final win against  Vicenza . Having lost the away leg 1–0 and then conceded an away
goal, Chelsea bounced back to win 3–1 on the night and go through, with Hughes again the
catalyst. They won their second Cup Winners' Cup title with a 1–0 victory against  VfB
Stuttgart  at the  RÃ¥sunda Stadium  in Stockholm , with Zola scoring with his first
touch having been on the pitch for just 17 seconds. Following that, Vialli led the club to a
1–0 win over European champions  Real Madrid  in the Super Cup  at the  Stade Louis II
 in  Monaco . During the  1998–99 Premiership  campaign, Chelsea made their first
sustained challenge for the title for years. Despite an opening day loss against  Coventry
City , the side were not beaten in the League again until January and topped the table at 
Christmas . Their title chances eventually disappeared after a home loss to  West Ham United
 and consecutive draws against Middlesbrough,  Leicester City  and  Sheffield
Wednesday  in April, which saw the Blues finish 3rd, four points behind winners Manchester
United. A season which promised much ultimately ended trophyless, with Chelsea's defence of
their Cup Winners' Cup title ending in a semi-final loss against  RCD Mallorca  while they
were knocked out of both the other cups in the quarter-finals. Third place in the league was
nevertheless high enough for a first-ever appearance in the  Champions League .

Weah 2000 FA Cup Final  starting lineup. 44 years after being denied entry to the inaugural
championship, Chelsea made their debut in Europe's premier competition in August 1999 and
they put in a series of impressive performances en route to a quarter-final tie against  FC
Barcelona . It included memorable draws at the  San Siro  and the Stadio Olimpico
 against  AC Milan  and  SS Lazio  respectively, as well as a thumping 5–0 win
against  Turkish  side  Galatasaray  at the  Ali Sami Yen Stadium . During the first leg
of the quarter-final against Barcelona at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea took a 3–0 lead, only to
concede a late  LuÃ­s Figo   away goal . Trailing 2–1 during the second leg at the  Camp
Nou , the team were just seven minutes away from the semi-finals, but conceded a third and were
eventually beaten 5–1 after  extra time , losing 6–4 on  aggregate . By now, Chelsea had
a top-notch multi-national squad which included Zola, Di Matteo, Poyet,  Dutch
 goalkeeper  Ed de Goey , and French  World Cup -winning trio Frank Leboeuf,  Marcel
Desailly  and  Didier Deschamps . Under Vialli, Chelsea would become the first side in
English football to field a starting 11 composed entirely of foreign players, highlighting
the increasing internationalization of the game. The  1999–2000  season saw
inconsistency return to Chelsea's league form as the side struggled to juggle Premier League
and Champions League commitments, ultimately finishing a disappointing 5th. Vialli did
lead the team to a second  FA Cup win  in four years that season – this time against  Aston
Villa , with Di Matteo again scoring the winner – in the last final to be played at Wembley
before its redevelopment. The  Charity Shield  was added in August with a 2–0 win
against  Manchester United , to make Vialli Chelsea's then most successful manager.

[ edit ] Claudio Ranieri (2000–2004)

Vialli spent almost £26m on new players during the summer, including high-scoring 
Dutchman   Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink  and talented  Icelandic striker  EiÃ°ur
GuÃ°johnsen , but was dismissed in September 2000 after winning just one of the opening five
matches and, once again, with rumours circulating that the manager had fallen out with
important players. [ 45 ]  He was replaced by another Italian,  Claudio Ranieri , who, in
spite of his initial problems with the English language, guided them to another top six finish
in his first season. Ranieri gradually re-built the side, reducing the average age of the
squad by selling some older players, including Wise and Poyet, and replacing them with  John
Terry , William Gallas ,  Frank Lampard  and  Jesper GrÃžnkjÃŠr .

Abramovich Ranieri's second season saw some more progress, mainly in the cups, with Chelsea
reaching the League Cup semi-finals and another FA Cup final, but was unable to prevent them
from losing to  double  winners  Arsenal  in the latter. League form saw little
improvement, though, and Chelsea again finished 6th. With rumours of the club's perilous
financial state circulating, Ranieri was unable to sign any more players. As a result,
expectations of Chelsea in the  2002–03  season were more limited. Chelsea
nevertheless made an unexpected title challenge and, in perhaps one of the most significant
matches in the club's history, defeated Liverpool 2–1 in the final game of the season to
finish 4th and secure the final Champions League berth ahead of the  Merseysiders . With the
club facing an apparent financial crisis, [ 46 ]  Bates unexpectedly sold Chelsea F.C. in
June 2003 for £60 million. [ 47 ]  In so doing, he reportedly recognised a personal profit of
£17 million on the club he had bought for £1 in 1982 (his stake had been diluted to just below
30% over the years). The club's new owner was Russian billionaire  Roman Abramovich , who
also took on responsibility for the club's £80 million of debt, quickly paying most of it. He
then went on a £100 million spending spree before the start of the season and landed players
like  Claude MakÃ©lÃ©lÃ© ,  Geremi ,  Glen Johnson ,  Joe Cole  and  Damien Duff
. The spending saw a good return, with Chelsea finishing as Premiership runners-up (their
best league finish for 49 years) and reaching the Champions League  semi-finals after
dramatically beating Arsenal in the quarter-finals. But Ranieri may have been sacked
because of some bizarre tactical decisions in the semi-final loss against  AS Monaco  (for
example, switching central midfielder  Scott Parker  to right-back and right-back Glen
Johnson to centre-back to accommodate more attackers in the team) and for ending the season
trophyless. Nevertheless, Ranieri was given a hero's send-off in his final match in charge.
That match also gave Chelsea fans a glimpse of what could easily have been if not for
Abramovich's takeover, as Chelsea handily beat Leeds United, who were relegated,
managerless, virtually bankrupt and seemingly destined for oblivion. In Ranieri's place,
Abramovich recruited  JosÃ© Mourinho  (who had lifted two  Portuguese league
 titles, a  Portuguese Cup , a European Cup  and a  UEFA Cup  with  FC Porto ) as the
club's new manager. Abramovich also brought legendary Dutch scout  Piet de Visser , who
scouted  Ronaldo  and  Romario  for  PSV Eindhoven , and is considered one of the
greatest scouts in history.

crest 2005–2006

(centenary) 2004–05 was the most successful season in the history of Chelsea Football
Club. After a slow start to the league season, scoring eight goals in their first nine games and
trailing leaders Arsenal by five points, Chelsea's title campaign gradually picked up
momentum, driven by the high-scoring  Frank Lampard  and the return from injury of
brilliant young Dutch winger  Arjen Robben  – with the latter in the side, Chelsea both
won more and scored more. They topped the table after a win against  Everton  in November
2004 and never relinquished their lead, losing only one league game all season and winning a
record 29, gaining a record 95 points in the process. A record-breaking defence, led by
captain  John Terry  and his new partnership with  Ricardo Carvalho , the versatile 
William Gallas , the brilliant fullback  Paulo Ferreira , midfield linchpin  Claude
MakÃ©lÃ©lÃ©  and talented goalkeeper  Petr ÄŒech , provided the backbone of the
side, conceding just 15 goals all season and keeping 25  clean sheets  while ÄŒech went
a  Premiership -record 1025 minutes without conceding a goal. Chelsea eventually secured
the title with a 2–0 away win at  Bolton Wanderers  thanks to two goals from Lampard,
almost fifty years to the day since they had won their last league title. Winning the league
completed a domestic double for the club, since Chelsea had already won the League Cup in
February after a thrilling  3–2 win  over Liverpool in the final at the  Millennium
Stadium .

Mourinho was a major figure during his time with Chelsea In the Champions League, Chelsea
coasted through the group stages, qualifying for the knockout phase with two games to spare,
and were drawn against  FC Barcelona , one of the strongest sides in Europe. In the first leg at
the Nou Camp , Chelsea took a 1–0 lead but had  Didier Drogba  controversially sent-off in
the second half with Chelsea still ahead, and the  Catalans eventually won 2–1. Mourinho
claimed that Barcelona manager  Frank Rijkaard  had spoken to referee  Anders Frisk  at
half-time – a claim later proved correct – and that the result had been "adulterated". [ 48
]  After receiving  death threats  from Chelsea fans, Frisk retired and Mourinho
received a two-match touchline ban for bringing the game into disrepute. Chelsea won a
pulsating return leg 4–2 at Stamford Bridge, with John Terry heading in a controversial
winner to send them through. In the quarter-finals, a 4–2 home win over German champions 
Bayern Munich  and a 3–2 loss in Germany were enough to ensure passage through to the
semi-finals, where they faced Liverpool. Following a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge,
Liverpool went 1–0 up at  Anfield  thanks to a disputed goal from  Luis GarcÃ­a  and
Chelsea were unable to break down a resilient defence, thus missing out on the chance of a
treble. A year later Chelsea retained their league title, setting more records in the
process. Winning their first nine games, the side emphatically set the pace in the 
Premiership  – including a 4–1 win over Liverpool at  Anfield  – and at one stage
were 18 points ahead of nearest rivals  Manchester United . Following a late-season blip,
and with United on a run of nine consecutive wins, the points gap was closed to seven points as
Chelsea went into a key match with  West Ham United . A goal down after ten minutes and a man down
after 17 following  Maniche 's  sending off , the side bounced back to win 4–1 and maintain
the gap. The title was eventually secured with a 3–0 win over United at  Stamford Bridge .
They became the first London club to win back-to-back league titles since the 1930s, and only
the fifth side to do so since the Second World War. They also set the record for the most clean
sheets (six) from the start of the season and equalled the best home record for a top division
team since  Newcastle United  in  1906–07  (18 wins and 1 draw from 19 games). In the
cups, however, there was less success as they were knocked out of the  Champions League
 by  FC Barcelona  and the FA Cup  semi-final by  Liverpool . The 2006–07 season saw
Chelsea relinquish the Premier League trophy to Manchester United after remaining second in
the league for the majority of the season. The club were still in the running to achieve an
unprecedented  quadruple  at the end of April, and played all but one of the maximum 63
possible games at the start of the season. They won the  League Cup  by beating  Arsenal
 2–1 in the last ever English cup final at the Millennium Stadium, and beat United 1–0 in
the first  FA Cup final  at the new Wembley Stadium; Chelsea were also the last team to win it
at the old Wembley. They reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, only to be knocked
out again by Liverpool, this time in a penalty shoot-out.

[ edit ] Grant, Scolari and Hiddink (2007–2009)

On 20 September 2007, Mourinho left Chelsea by "mutual consent" [ 49 ]  following an
indifferent start to the season and after several months of well-documented friction
between Mourinho and Abramovich. [ 50 ]  Shortly afterwards  Israeli   Avram Grant , who
had been appointed Chelsea's director of football on 8 July 2007, [ 51 ]  was announced as
Mourinho's successor. [ 52 ] Despite the managerial upheaval and a high level of player
absence (in all, members of the team were unavailable for selection 286 times in the 62
fixtures), [ 53 ]  Chelsea were on course to win  three different competitions , a feat
previously achieved by only two other English clubs, Liverpool in 1983–84 and Manchester
United in 1998–99, but ultimately finished as runners-up in all three. Chelsea reached
their third  League Cup final  in four years, but suffered a surprise 2–1 defeat to
mid-table Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley. Chelsea emerged as United's closest rivals in the
title race; a 2–1 victory over United at Stamford Bridge in April left the teams level on
points with four games remaining. [ 54 ]  The teams were still level on points going into the
final game of the season, although United's superior goal difference meant Chelsea had to
better their result; in the event, Chelsea drew 1–1 with  Bolton Wanderers  and United
beat  Wigan Athletic  to take the title. Grant also led Chelsea to their fourth Champions
League semi-final in five years, and they were again drawn to face Liverpool, although this
time it was Chelsea who prevailed, winning 4–3 on aggregate to reach the final for the first
time in their history. Their opponents in the final were Manchester United, making it the
first all-English final in the competition's history. [ 55 ]  In an even game, Lampard's
first-half strike cancelled out  Cristiano Ronaldo 's opener, and the teams remained at
1–1 for the rest of the match, taking the final to a  penalty shootout , where John Terry
and  Nicolas Anelka 's misses from the spot gave United victory. After the conclusion of the
2007–08 season, Chelsea became the highest ranked club under  UEFA 's five-year 
coefficient  system used in the seeding of European club competitions in the following
season, a sign of the consistency of the club's performance over the first five years of Roman
Abramovich's ownership. [ 56 ] Grant was sacked as Chelsea manager three days later. [ 57 ]
 Grant's replacement was Brazilian  Luiz Felipe Scolari , who had guided  Brazil  to
victory at the  2002 FIFA World Cup  and Portugal  to runners-up at  Euro 2004 . [ 58 ]
 However, despite a bright start which saw Chelsea top the league table early in the season,
Scolari was sacked on 9 February 2009 due to "results and performances of the team...
deteriorating at a key time in the season", and with the club lying 4th in the Premier League. [
59 ]   Russia  coach  Guus Hiddink  was appointed caretaker manager until the end of the
season. Under Hiddink, performances and results improved; Chelsea lost just one more game
all season, eventually finishing 3rd in the league and reaching the FA Cup final. In the
Champions League, a 7–5 aggregate win over Liverpool in the quarter-finals, including an
epic 4–4 draw at Stamford Bridge, took Chelsea to another semi-final, against  FC
Barcelona . After drawing 0–0 in the first leg at the  Nou Camp , Chelsea took an early lead in
the second through Essien, but in a controversial game, in which Chelsea squandered numerous
chances and had several penalty appeals turned down, a  stoppage time  equaliser from 
AndrÃ©s Iniesta  sent Barcelona through on away goals. In the immediate aftermath,
Drogba caused more controversy after swearing at referee  Tom Henning Ã˜vrebÃž . [ 60 ]
 In consolation, goals from Drogba and Lampard gave Chelsea a 2–1 victory over  Everton
 in the  FA Cup Final  at Wembley on 30 May, the club's second FA Cup triumph in three years. [
61 ]

[ edit ] The Ancelotti Era (Since 2009)

Former  AC Milan  coach  Carlo Ancelotti  was confirmed as Hiddink's successor on 1 June
2009. [ 62 ]  He started his career by winning the  World Football Challenge  in the  USA .
In Ancelotti's first competitive match Chelsea met Manchester United in the  Community
Shield . The game ended in a 2–2 draw, with Chelsea winning 4–1 on penalties to take the
trophy, the club's first victory in a shoot-out since beating  Ipswich Town  in the League
Cup in January 1998. [ 63 ] On 3 September 2009, in a rare but not unprecedented punishment,
Chelsea were  banned  from registering any new players for the next two  transfer windows
, in January and Summer 2010, after  FIFA 's dispute resolution chamber (DRC) ruled that
French winger  GaÃ«l Kakuta  had  breached his contract  with French club  RC Lens
 when he joined Chelsea in 2007, and that Chelsea had induced him to do so. [ 64 ]  The club were
subsequently cleared by the  Court of Arbitration for Sport  and the transfer ban was
lifted. [ 65 ] At the end of a season where Chelsea exchanged places at the top of the table with
Manchester United several times, and were briefly leapfrogged by Arsenal, they sealed their
third Premier League title in six seasons with an 8–0 home win over  Wigan Athletic  on the
final day of the season. The win also took Chelsea's league goal tally for the season to 103, the
highest since  Tottenham Hotspur  in 1963, and the very first time in Premier League
history that a club had scored 100 or more goals in a season. [ 66 ]  A week later, Chelsea
completed the first " league title and FA Cup double " in the club's history by beating 
Portsmouth  1–0 in the  FA Cup final , thanks to a  Didier Drogba  free-kick, his
seventh goal in six cup finals for Chelsea. [ 67 ]
