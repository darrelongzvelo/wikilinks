Bluebird

March 28, 2010

http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/img_0684.jpg?w=270&h=151
I’m in Snowbird, Utah for the week! The annual trip began with an elusive ‘Bluebird’
day. Cobalt skies, bright sun, perfect skiing. Clear skies up here isn’t that common, so
when it happens, it deserves a nickname. I’m loving spending time with my favorite ski
partners – Kristen and Katie – and it’s a delight to have Mo join the squad. Tonight, as a
squad, we watched BILL & TED’S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.

Considering this vacation is well-earned —- I turned in a big writing assignment on Friday
—- you should probably consider me off-the-grid. Â However, I am doing a bit of work here
in the tranquil mountains… it doesn’t feel like work when you’ve skied all day. I think
they call this perspective. So who knows, maybe I will blog about my doings. I am reading and
giving feedback on a few scripts of talented AFI writer colleagues, a series of short stories a
friend is hoping to publish, LOSERS re-working of the first act and a potential directing gig
on a financed series of shorts written, directed and produced by women.

I’m also working on drinking wine, soaking in the hot tub, Â and shredding this mountain
to bits.

Tulip Blew-Up

March 17, 2010



Image:
http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/tulip_blewup.jpg?w=240&h=179
I’ve been up since 5AM because I had to review the newest (and strongest) draft of LOSERS as
well as reading the latest draft of my own script before a 9:30AM meeting with Gabe.

WHERE’S MY PRIZE?

I know, I know… repeat after me… the reward is the good work and awesome projects with my
name on ‘em.

A more tangible prize are the tulips I bought for myself. Lucky for me, they inspired LilyDidIt
‘s POTW (“picture of the week” for those not in The Know) which then spawned a little
visit to Photoshopland to tweak the colors and make LDI’s Facebook logo to last us until next
Wednesday.

http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/tulip.jpg?w=499&h=367

Next draft deadline is Friday night at 7pm. Â Yay! I’ll get to go out and enjoy the earned
evening. Gotta back to it…

Reprint: My SportsFanLive Blog Post

March 15, 2010

On the heels of my trip to the Vancouver Olympics with the APPOINTMENT IN VANCOUVER “crew”
(aka Seth Caplan, producer, and Mo Grosser, music sup), I was approached about writing a blog
post about the experience for SportsFanLive .

So I did. Chance to gush about my film AND score free PR? Yes, please.

The post is still available here ,Â BUT because I’m cranking out another draft of the book
adaptation* today (a pass on the bad girl character… making her badder), and a shiny, new
draft of LOSERS was delivered yesterday, I don’t have time to do a fresh blog post. I believe
in recycling in real life and in blog life so… I’m publishing my SportsFanLive post here
for those who missed it the first time and for those who were to lazy to click this time.

Bonus! I’ll include more pics from the trip than the SportsFanLive people did. Yeah, I got
your back.





Director Anna Christopher was in Vancouver to follow skier Casey Puckett, the subject of her
documentary, Appointment In Vancouver . The film focuses on Puckettâ€™s life as a
world-class athlete, father of two and hometown hero, who was preparing for his fifth Olympic
appearance. Here is Christopher’s account Puckett’s latest Olympic experience:

Image:
http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/team-aiv-entering-the-stadium.jpg?w=300&h=225

The girls of team AIV got lots of attention for our gear and not being disgusting looking.

We made awesome signs. Amazing signs. Signs that deserved to be on TV. Which was exactly the
intention.

After camera-tailing four-time OlympianÂ  Casey Puckett for three years and making an
applauded documentary about him, my producer, music supervisor, brother (who is in the film)
and I scrapped our way to the Olympic Games. With our signs in hand, we were determined to get our
film, Appointment In Vancouver , and our favorite skier cross racer, Casey Puckett, some
network coverage.

Appointment In Vancouver documents Caseyâ€™s
dramatic/thrilling/gut-wrenching/inspiring journey to the Games. We capture the
challenges Casey faces as an elite athlete competing on the worldâ€™s stage and as a
father juggling gold-medal dreams while raising kids. The film offers audiences a rare,
exclusive glimpse of the mental, emotional and physical trials of a retired Olympic athlete
making a comeback at age 37.

http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/anna-director-on-left-music-supervisor-mo-on-right.jpg?w=300&h=225

Me, our tickets, Mo.

The film was born the moment I met Casey. The IOC had recently named Skier Cross as the
â€œnewâ€� Olympic sport to debut in Vancouver. Casey said then that he â€œhad
an appointment in Vancouver.â€� His unwavering faith and determination to compete in
the 21st Winter Olympics hooked me. Heâ€™d competed on the U.S. Ski team since he was 19,
raced in Albertville, Lillehammer, Nagano and Salt Lake City. Never medaled. He retired
after his final Olympics. Final? Actually, not so much. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons his
story is so inspiring.

Through a mix of chance, fate, and itch of â€œunfinished business,â€� Casey fell in
love with the emerging sport of Skier Cross. Before he knew it, he was back on the slopes and
dominating the field unlike heâ€™d ever done as an Alpine racer. Heâ€™d found his
cup of tea, and he was guzzling it down. Even Daron Rahlves , Caseyâ€™s teammate, Alpine
racing legend, and co-star ofÂ  Appointment In Vancouver , admits that Casey was better at
Skier Cross than he ever was in Alpine. In the film, Daron says, â€œMy heart pumps a little
harder when I line up against Casey because I know what he can do.â€�

"O Canada" you love red. And Chris Del Bosco.

As theÂ  Appointment In Vancouver crew climbed the million stairs to the grandstand on
February 21, 2010, we wondered what Casey would do that day. The crowd seemed to be pondering
the same thing of all the athletes. An excited but serious vibe emanated from the grandstand as
the first heats began. Every race of four-on-four skiers was enthralling but the crashes were
brutal, which I think caused the pensive energy in the stands. There was no doubt — this sport
was way more electrifying than curling.

Friends have told me the TV coverage made the course appear easy. From our vantage point,
itÂ was not. The crowd gave every race its entire attention because if you looked away for a
second, you may miss something unbelievable. This universal focus gave bonded all of us in the
crowd without words. We were all there for the love of this new sport and the fearless racers who
tried to conquer it.

http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/monster-jump.jpg?w=300&h=225

Monster jump after "trouble alley" at the end of the SX course.

In the first couple heats, scary pile-ups unfolded right before our eyes in the last turn to the
final obstacle — a monster jump. We started calling that toilet-bowl turn â€œtrouble
alleyâ€� and worried about how Casey would handle it. I remembered Caseyâ€™s
perseverance. He fought through seven surgeries to be here. His most recent injury happened
in January when on the way to his first World Cup victory. He fell a mere six seconds from the
finish and separated his shoulder. In that moment, even he thought the ride was over. However,
he pushed through, rehabbed the injury in six weeks, and was here in Cypress on the day Skier
Cross was debuting at the Games. No matter what Casey would be a part of history.

And he was. Not with a medal or a massive crash but by laying down a solid race. Because of his

Daron, on the other hand, did crash.

injured shoulder, he came out of the gates slower than heâ€™d like and found himself in
fourth place. Despite his best efforts, he stayed in fourth for the whole race.

Casey and I texted after the event. What did I say? Iâ€™m not sure. Thereâ€™s not a
go-to phrase for â€œIâ€™m sorry you didnâ€™t achieve your dream and our dream
for you.â€� I know he was disappointed. So was I. But he gave the race everything he had and
thatâ€™s all you can ask. TheÂ  Appointment In Vancouver team remained in the stands
until the end of the event, enjoying the spectacle of the sport but without the gusto with which
we began. We left our signs in the stands.

The funny thing is that when I returned to Los Angeles, I screenedÂ  Appointment In
Vancouver for a few friends. The film ends just before Casey goes to the Olympics. My friends
knew the outcome of the Games, yet they loved the film. Even I still loved it. I realized that
Casey didnâ€™t win a medal on February 21, 2010, but the journey that got him to that
historic day, hisÂ  Appointment In Vancouver , was pure gold.

–Â  ANNA CHRISTOPHER

*When am I going to announce the book and the subsequent project news!?!?!?! I’m waiting on a
few possible press opps to either play out or to die a cold, ignored death to determine when I
sing the news from the blogsphere mountain tops.

Hoo

March 13, 2010

After a four hour meeting with Gabe about Draft 2 (we’re only suppose to meet for two and a half
hours because our brains go mush after that point but somehow we never keep our vow), I needed a
power boost. The universe heard my call.

JR and I hit up a sample sale of high-waisted, size tiny, Grey Ant jeans, then a few
Silverlake-Echo Park oddity shops, and then at Spitfire Girl ,Â I got the boost the
universe knew I needed: a big owl vase. The owl is my power animal, and during these dog-days of
adaptation, he is a welcome visitor in my Â life.

A woman came into the shop claiming she is having a”owl-themed wedding” and, therefore,
was also tempted by the ceramic owl. It would have been perfect for her.

WOULD HAVE BEEN.

She left! Didn’t buy it! Said she was going to maybe (maybe not) come back! Immediately, JR
and the Sales Clerk told me I should purchase our mighty owl. I, being thoughtful, kind and made
of sugar, was concerned about the bride. Â For a few minutes. Then I bought him.

“140,” the innovative, twitter-inspired, feature film organized by Frank Kelly, will
have it’s world premiere at the 1th annualÂ  Newport Beach Film Festival . I was one of 140
filmmakers to direct a segment of the film. I will definitely make it out to the fest to see the
final cut of the project and eat at Newport Beach’s famous crabshack. We dined there when
QUEEN played the same festival years ago.

As of now, I only know that the fest will take place April 22-29. Will update you when I know more.

Nominated Editors Spill the Beans

March 10, 2010



Image:
http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/alan.jpg?w=350&h=263 On
Saturday I attended the Egyptian Theater’s “Invisible Art, Visible Artists”
Seminar. Â The free seminar is an annual tradition for my friends and me on Oscar weekend.
Â Every year the Oscar-nominated editors show up, talk their film, their craft and show a
clip. Â It’s moderated by Alan Heim who is a great editor (ALL THAT JAZZ, NETWORK, THE
NOTEBOOK) and my dad’s doppelgÃ€nger. Â They have the same warm, welcoming energy,
inquisitive listening ability, bushy mustache and even speaking style.

The editors in attendance this year were:

Stephen Rivkin and John Refoua (AVATAR),Â Julian Clarke (DISTRICT 9),Â Sally Menke
(INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS),Â Bob Murawski and Chris Innis (THE HURT LOCKER),Â Joe Klotz
(PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL â€˜PUSHâ€™ BY SAPPHIRE).

I’d already seen the five represented films and enjoyed all of them tremendously (except
for DISTRICT 9). I like it when I’ve previously viewed the films because seeing the clips
becomes extra enlightening and satisfying. It’s like reminiscing over old pictures of
your favorite relatives the night before a family reunion.

My favorite editor was Sally Menke. I’ve seen her interviewed in an AFI Master’s Seminar
for one of the KILL BILLS, but I’d forgotten how articulate, thoughtful and wildly
intelligent she is. Â I was absolutely thrilled when Sally showed and discussed the scene
from INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS that I blogged about and continues to be one of my most read posts:
The Strudel Scene . See below for the juicy insights she offered.

Joe Klotz was my second favorite. I watched PRECIOUS the night before so it was freshly awed in
my world. He loves his profession and the art behind it. I got the sense that he has great respect
for whatever story he’s telling and for the characters in that story. He was grounded,
sincere and without frills. Joe chose the scene in which Precious and her mother physically
fight after Precious comes home with her new baby. This is one of the best scenes in the film. See
below for more details on what he had to say about its creation.



Image:
http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/joe3.jpg?w=500&h=185

Unfortunately, neither Sally or Joe won a golden statue the next night.

    A few insights and behind-the-scenes stories I’ll remember from the seminar:

    - The AVATAR guys had 10 assistants. Sally employed seven assistants (mostly because
    BASTERDS featured English, German, and English scenes). THE HURT LOCKER duo had three
    assistants for their 200 hours of footage. Â Because of budget constraints, Joe Klotz
    edited PRECIOUS on his own Avid in his home. He had one assistant who would sometimes work
    off his personal laptop. You do whatever it takes to make your movie.

    

    - Sally and Chris+Bob (THE HURT LOCKER) spoke about how their films

    Image:
    http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/hurtlocker.jpg?w=300&h=193

    THE HURTLOCKER editors won the Oscar.

    mixed humor with tension. Sally credits this to Quentin’s voice and the tone of his
    films. Chris and Bob believe comedy was an important way to diffuse the tension in their
    nerve-wracking (in a good way) film.

    

    - Sally’s interest and education in human psychology lead her to filmmaking.

    

    - Sally and Quentin had planned to change the Strudel Scene after Cannes. And they did.
    Instead of covering the beginning of the scene when Landa arrives with shots of Landa, the
    officer and Shosanna, the camera remains on and slowly pushes in on Shosanna’s face
    during all the pleasantries. She’s listening to the men and steeling herself for
    facing Landa (the man whoÂ murdered her family years ago). Sally explained that all
    that matters in that moment is Shosanna realizing what’s happening and what she must
    doÂ (not be suspected by Landa). Â They wanted the audience to be with Shosanna,
    seeing into her soul at this important moment.

    

    - Sally also explained the last beat of the scene in which Landa leaves and Shosanna
    gasps/cries and releases tension and fear she was containing while they ate strudel.
    Sally gives us only the briefest of moments of Shosanna gasping and then cuts away.
    Â They made this editorial decision because they wanted Shosanna to be a strong woman.
    It was important that the audience think of her as a tough character because she will go on
    to plan Hitler’s assassination.

    

    - Joe said he picked the clip he did because he wanted to talk about the trust between
    director and editor. Â When he first cut that scene, it didn’t work. The stunts
    weren’t so good, and the coverage was lacking. He couldn’t make the scene sing.
    Director Lee Daniels told Joe he wanted to do a photo shoot with Mo’Nique and Precious
    depicting them from when Precious was a baby through her childhood. Joe trusted in
    Lee’s idea even though he was initially doubtful. Mo’Nique and Baby
    PreciousÂ start out a happy mother-daughter duo and then, when the abuses starts and
    continues, the stress, tension, and unhappiness show on their faces in the pictures. Lee
    took the pics and gave them to Joe, trusting him to figure out how to work them into the
    scene. And he did. Brilliantly.

She Wins

March 8, 2010



Image:
http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/0000031005.jpg?w=740 Last
night I watched the Oscars with a room full of filmmaker friends. Some of them were my friends
before we ever made a movie together, and some of them are my friends because we worked
together. But it doesn’t really matter how our friendship blossomed. What does matter is
that I was with them, all of us cheering, when Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to receive
an Oscar for her achievement in directing.Â I was with the people who have supported me,
believed in me, cheered for ME in my burgeoning career as a (woman) director. Around me were
filmmakers that inspire me, collaborators that make me better at my craft, talents that I want
to work with for the rest of my career. I was exactly where I should have been.

The meaningfulness of Kathryn’s win has been questioned and even lost on some. Â Scott
Mendelson of THE HUFFINGTON POST said:

“While it’s terrific that the previously-undervalued Bigelow became the first female
to win Best Director, it’s more than a little depressing that such a big deal must be made of
it. As I’ve always said, progress comes when you don’t have to talk about it… On the other
hand, how refreshing that a black man was nominated for Best Director and we more or less forgot
about the color of his skin during the campaign season? Progress comes when we don’t feel the
need to mention it.”

For me, it is “such a big deal.” And no one is saying we’ve made progress. I think the major
attention paid to Kathryn Bigelow’s nomination and predicted win is more about noticing
the lack of progress but the potential for it.



Image:
http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/article-1268036188618-089eeb5e000005dc-560664_466x3101.jpg?w=300&h=199
I’m glad “The Kathryn Bigelow Story” got media attention even if some of the approaches
were misguided (Scott does go into this in a way less revolting way: “What bugged me most
about the awards season is how so many pundits tried to turn James Cameron into the big male
bully and Kathryn Bigelow into some helpless female victim of his male oppression.” ) It
would have needed drugs to pull me out of the depression I’d fall into if no one had noticed or
cared that it took us 82 years to produce a woman director whose work was worthy of the award AND
give it to her.

I say ‘us’ because it’s easy to point the finger at the Academy, but is it their fault that
only 7% of directors (the same as in 1987) on the 250 top-grossing movies are women? They
didn’t create patriarchy.

Very few women choose to direct. Fewer still actually get to make movies. This is not to say that
we should scurry to “make up for it” and give anyone with two X chromosomes the bullhorn or
that doors should open because it’s forward-thinking to consider a directorial candidate
who owns a mini skirt. I want it to be about the work not if someone’s got a womb. (Kathryn
Bigelow did the work. I thought so back in July when I saw THE HURT LOCKER .) For the work to be
good, more women filmmakers have to go out there and make killer movies, which is difficult no
matter what your gender. However, I believe, it’s even harder if you aren’t part of the
club. As the numbers show us, women directors are the unusual, the unexpected and unknown
which is an unpopular choice to champion, finance, or encourage in a town that operates under
the mantra of No.

Personally, it means a lot to me that Kathryn Bigelow won. It reinforces that I haven’t
dreamed a madwoman’s dream. But in the big picture, it means a lot that Kathryn Bigelow won
because the moment she got on that stage and took that little, gold man in her hands, the idea of a
woman successfully directing a film wasn’t quite so unorthodox, surprising, or
crazytown. It became real and 41.3 million people were watching.

The Breakups on GOSSIP GIRL

http://annachristophernews.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/gossip_girl_logo-12828.jpg?w=180&h=180
The breakups have a song on tonight’s episode of GOSSIP GIRL (9/8c, CW). Â I watch this
show. Often with my friend Caged Heat. Yes, that’s a nickname not a metaphor. The band tells
me that “Tissue Sample” will be used. Â No word yet on which inevitably sordid scene
will backdrop their tune.

I’ve licensed the breakups’ music for 90% of my projects – most recently forÂ 
APPOINTMENT IN VANCOUVER . Glad GG finally got on the bandwagon.

They Responded with the Opposite of Yes

March 6, 2010

I blogged about the following possibilities for APPOINTMENT IN VANCOUVER so now I feel
responsible to finish the story.

We didn’t get into Florida Film Festival or Tribeca Film Festival.

ESPN “loved” the film but said that if they’d seen the film months ago they could have
worked with it in some capacity but presently (which was about four weeks ago) that was no
longer possible.

It may be ‘cool’ to be a filmmaker but sometimes it’s icy cold.
