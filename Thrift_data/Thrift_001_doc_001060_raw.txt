Edit



The pilot episodes were executive produced and narrated by Thom Beers who also created the
series, and directed, co-written, and produced by Will Raee and co-written by Tom McMahon.

The first two episodes are visually distinct from the rest of the series, as they were
originally intended to be the only episodes. They both open with the words of the disclaimer
displayed in white font on black background, while the voice-over reads: "The stories you are
about to see are true and based on actual events. Names have been changed to protect the
identities of the deceased." "WARNING: The deaths portrayed in this show are real and
extremely graphic." The disclaimer then cuts to a scene of a city at night, followed by images
of various manners of death, either from episodes or file footages , while the voice-over
reads the monologue, which appears in "comic-book" style (comic font inside yellow boxes, as
in a comic book ): "The human body is remarkably resilient ..." "But death...is everywhere.
Most of us try to avoid it, others can't get out of its way..." (note: in the following sentence,
only the ALL CAPPED words are illustrated in large, red " Sin City "/"comic" font; the rest are
only heard) "Every day we fight a new WAR against GERMS, TOXINS, INJURY, ILLNESS, CATASTROPHE
and Calamity." "There's a lot of ways to wind up dead." "The fact that we survive at all is a
miracle..." "Because, every day we live..." "We face 1000 WAYS TO DIE ." The first story begins
with the opening screenshot drawn as a comic, which fades to the live action. The narrator
gives an account of the story as it unfolds, describing the circumstances leading up to the
death and details of the death itself. The story is interspersed with expert testimony from
physicians and scientists about the science of the death (what happens to the body, etc.). The
story ends with another comic screenshot, over which the "Way to Die # " and the nickname for the
death is typed over the image in black and red "True Crimes"/"Sin City"/"comic" font. This
pans right to trivia about a similar incident or related scientific fact, usually less than 30
seconds long, which is depicted entirely in comic formatting. The process repeats with the
second story, which then cuts directly to commercial after the trivia. The third and fourth
stories also follow this format. The fifth story follows suit, but instead goes directly to
commercial after the trivia bit. The sixth story is also depicted, and then cuts to the
real-life story segment, which does not employ the comic face. When the real-life story ends,
the credits roll in red and yellow comic font on black/white-flecked background.

The second episode mimics the first, except that the first and second stories are so long on
their own that they go straight to commercial after their related trivia. The third and fourth
stories follow the prior pattern, only without the trivia bits; the fifth story then leads
into the real-life story, both without trivia.

Originally aired May 21, 2008. Death # "Event" Name Circumstances of Death 293 Freeze Died A

Believed to be dead, the poisoned brother is buried alive, and his corpse is later found by
grave robbers . Shortly before the brother's death, he tried to claw his way out with his
fingers, wearing them down to the bone. 606 Wet Dream A man who wants to live like a fish
constructs a fish suit out of waterbed material and attempts to use it. The suit is so
constricting, however, that he cannot get into the water fast enough, and he perishes from
heat exhaustion . (This is a based off the death of a man in Melbourne, Australia.) 112 Fur
Burger In the 2nd century, one method of execution was wrapping the victim in freshly-killed
animal skins, tying him to a tree, and leaving him to be eaten alive by whatever carnivores
happened to be in the area. In this case, it was a flock of vultures.

Edit



Shot months after the pilot, the first full season is executive produced by Thom Beers who also
created the series. Season One was written and directed by Tom McMahon. This season also
debuted a new narrator with actor Ron Perlman instead of Beers who previously narrated the
pilot episodes.

The episodes in Season One, while maintaining the " tongue-in-cheek " story-telling aspect
of the first two shows, vary in formatting compared to the pilot. The "comic-book" styling is
completely gone, as are the trivia bits between segments. Each episode opens with a
voice-over by the narrator giving brief summaries of upcoming deaths, accompanied by clips.
This fades to a more ominous version of the previous disclaimer: white wording on black
background, while a deeper, echoing voice-over reads: " WARNING: The deaths portrayed in
this show are real and extremely graphic." "The names have been changed to protect the
identities of the deceased." "Do not attempt to try ANY of the actions depicted." "YOU WILL
DIE!" (the word "DIE" echoes ominously). The disclaimer then cuts to animation depicting
human figures encountering various deaths, while the voice-over reads (note: only the ALL
CAPPED words are illustrated) :

"Death...is everywhere. Most of us try to avoid it, others can't get out of its way. Every day we
fight a new war against GERMS, TOXINS, INJURY, ILLNESS, and CATASTROPHE." "There's a lot of
ways to wind up dead. The fact that we survive at all is a miracle, because every day we live, we
face 1000 WAYS TO DIE ." This introduction cuts to a screenshot of the "victim", framed by gray
grainy film art, and information appears as being typed out onto screen: "DATE" and
"LOCATION". The stories are played out as in the "Pilot Season", but end as they began, with a
different screenshot of the "victim" (this time, they are usually dead), again framed in
grainy film art, over which the "Way to Die # " and the nickname for the death typed over the image
in black, yellow and red "True Crimes"/"Sin City"/"comic" font. Two stories are shown in this
manner, then an outro to the commercial says, "Coming up:" followed by brief, clever
descriptions of upcoming deaths. This is usually repeated twice. After the last commercial
break, the real-life story is shown, followed immediately by the end credits, which appear as
white spray-painted bold letters on a grainy film background, backed by heavy metal music .

Season 2 was set to premiere on Dec. 9, 2009 at 10 PM (EST), but a special airing of the season
premiere episode was shown on Dec. 6, 2009 at 12:30 AM (EST). The real-life scenarios of people
escaping death shown at the ending were dropped to make room for more segments. The deaths are
slightly more graphic in this season, and "Idiot Alerts" (in the same font as the "Way to Die #"
and nicknames descriptions are) were added to deaths from moronic and ill-advised stunts
that could easily be imitated in real life. Another change is that under "Location", only the
city is told, not the city and the specific location as it was in Season 1. The wording of the
opening disclaimer was changed slightly from Season 1:

"WARNING: The stories portrayed in this show are based on real deaths and are extremely
graphic." "Names have been changed to protect the identities of the deceased."



"Do not attempt to try ANY of the actions depicted." "YOU WILL DIE!" (this time, the emphasis is
on the word "WILL").

corporate espionage climbs into an air vent to install the bug by the hotel suite which an

dies along with a new vehicle sunk to the bottom of the lake). [6 ]

a theatre assigns himself as the lead in a play he's producing. While doing a flying scene the
holster holding him up is unable to hold his weight, causing it to break. The frayed edge of the
cord then unwinds and races through the system of pulleys at over 700 miles per hour, passing
through the air and slashing the man's jugular vein. 368 Cloudy With a Chance of Pain June 22,
2009 Moscow, Russia A Russian pimp is preparing to leave with one of his prostitutes. She gets
in the car, but locks herself inside when the car is pelted with cement bricks from a failed
cloud seeding operation. As the pimp struggles to get in the car, he is hit in the head by a chunk
of cement and killed. ( As mentioned in the article on cloud seeding , such incident did occur
when a bag of cement failed to open properly, but no deaths or injuries occurred as a result.)
895 Pop Goes The Cholo (a.k.a. Sin-Tubated) August 25, 2008 Albuquerque , NM Two street gang
members take a third member to a back alley doctor to treat a bullet wound to the chest. The gang
leader ends up pistol whipping the doctor into unconsciousness after losing patience with
him. With the doctor out cold, the gang members decide to do the operation themselves, but fail
after inserting the intubation tube down the injured member's esophagus , rather than the
trachea , and end up hemorrhaging the injured member's stomach by filling it with air and
causing it to explode. (This death features the third instance of an interviewee being shown
in shadow for criminal protection and the first time voice alteration is used, in the case of a
gang doctor named Bennie Wilson) 205 Flame Retard-Ant (a.k.a. Stop, Drop, and Die) July 6,
2005 Burnside , KY A pyromaniac attempts to set a tree ablaze after dousing it with gasoline.
Unfortunately, he gets gasoline on his pants and ends up in flames. However, he is quick to jump
into the adjacent river, but the melting of his muscles and cartilage cause shock and
paralysis . The man collapses into the lake and drowns. 245 Rocky Roadkill (a.k.a. Ice Fiend
Man) September 2, 2007 Riverside , CA A drug dealer doing business out of an ice cream truck is
mugged by a meth addict. The driver manages to get away, but upon encountering a sharp turn, the
freezer topples over and leaks chlorofluorocarbon into the truck. The dealer blacks out from
inhaling the refrigerant and slams into a tree, the impact of which ruptures his aortic valve
and causes death by exsanguination. 404 Straight To DVDead (a.k.a. Duel Personalities)
December 6, 2005 Hollywood , CA Two men are reenacting a 1775 Revolutionary War duel for a
movie. One man, upset that he didn't get the lead role, plots to kill the other, so he slips a lead
ball into the gun chamber to make the death seem like an accident. However, when he fires the

the bull and subsequently thrown from a hilltop to his death, whereupon Phalaris himself was
thrown into the bull after being overthrown.)

Coming (a.k.a. Terrorist Wedding) September 24, 2006 Afghanistan An American woman turned
terrorist celebrates with the Taliban by firing off several rounds of an AK-47 into the air

strikes her in the forehead, killing her instantly. 264 Crate and Buried (a.k.a. Air Maul)
August 15, 2004 Darfur , Sudan Two thieves in Sudan steal supply crates needed for refugees . As
the men celebrate, they suddenly get crushed by a falling supply crate that had a faulty
parachute . 458 Lost In Transfusion (a.k.a. Cold Blooded) May 16, 2002 Chicago , IL In order to
beat a company drug test , a cocaine -addicted crane operator injects himself with blood that
matches his type, stolen from a hospital by his girlfriend. However, he doesn't listen when
she warns him to warm the blood before injecting it. He stores the blood in the refrigerator
overnight before injecting it, and as a result, it causes ventricular fibrillation and
tachycardia . 678 Arriva-Deadci (a.k.a. Crying Over Spilled Guts) September 8, 2008
Rochester , NY After a convict on parole is ordered to take out the trash at his new job, he smarts
off to the supervisor. When the parole officer comes to check up on him, he is taking out the
trash as asked. However, he forgets to lock the wheels on the dumpster , which starts to roll
down a slope, crushing the convict against another dumpster, thus piercing his abdomen and
extruding his innards. (May be based on the death of Rodney Brown who was crushed to death when a
dump truck he was operating slipped out of gear and rolled backwards, pinning him between a
dumpster and a gate). [7 ] 402 Miss-Ur Head (a.k.a. Off With His Head) March 8, 1925 Marseille,
France A French criminal is executed via guillotine . His head is studied by a scientist to see
if and how long it stays alive after it is severed . (This is one of the few deaths that is not based
on stupidity or unusual circumstances. Instead it is an experimental procedure and a means of
capital punishment.) 247 Eye-Sick-Kill (a.k.a Silent Night) November 29, 2008 Cedar
Springs , MI A perverted stoner gets fired from his job as a mall Santa . Because of his
intoxicated state, he doesn't hear what his boss says and starts banging on the door to get his
boss to tell him what he said. While banging, an icicle falls from the roof's edge and the man
looks up just in time for the icicle to impale him in his eye and through his brain (likely based
on numerous deaths from falling icicles, including the case where different five people were
killed in 2008 in the Russian city of Samara) [8 ]

Death 219 Chairway to Heaven (a.k.a. Ouch Potato) November 20, 2003 Milwaukee , WI A selfish
man who abandoned his family to "be himself" gets drunk with his friend while setting up his new
house. He brings in a pilot seat from a Soviet fighter jet, unaware that it still works. He pulls
the lever on the seat and is launched 10 feet into the air, crushing his skull against the roof.
623 Eye Swallow (a.k.a. Socket to Me) February 14, 2008 Berkeley , CA A man with acrotomophilia
has sex with a woman who has a glass eye and who lost her arm in a car accident. The woman puts her
eye in a glass with water before continuing. When they are done, she runs to his shower and the
man takes a drink from the glass with the eye, and chokes to death when he accidentally swallows
her glass eye. 255 The Depart-Dead (a.k.a. Gangsta Trapped) March 25, 1991 South Boston , MA A
group of teens play a drinking game called Edward Fortyhands , in which drinkers have beer
bottles taped to their hands and they can't do anything (smoke, urinate, leave the room, etc.)
until the beer bottles are empty. One of them spits a half-lit cigar under a couch, which starts
burning the flammable synthetic stuffing, releasing hydrogen cyanide into the room.
Because they can't open the door, they suffocate on the fumes. 621 Spyanide April 17, 1943
Norfolk , VA An American spy working for the Nazis has a short meeting in a park. After that
meeting, an American tries to return his notebook that he left behind. The spy thinks the
American returning his notebook is out to get him and takes his own life by swallowing cyanide
pills . (This is the first intentional suicide in the series, although it can be based on any
number of suicides at the end of World War II where a cyanide capsule was used or spies working
behind enemy lines and taking their life to avoid capture.) 126 Game Stopped (a.k.a. Game
Over) October 4, 2008 Mattituck , NY A video game addict plays for 60 straight hours trying to
take down his opponents and become the highest-ranked player in the world. When his last
opponent, a girl, beats him at the very last second, he furiously stands up, then drops dead,
unaware that his leg veins had formed clots from being sedentary for so long and now the clots
had moved into his heart and lungs. (Possibly based on the death of Lee Seung Seop , who died
playing StarCraft for the same amount of hours. This is also the first death that shows how the
person died that isn't in the regular CGI format. It is instead shown as a Donkey Kong -esque
format.) 305 Moving Violation (a.k.a. The Long Haul) July 9, 1994 Evanston , IL Two con-movers
are helping a woman move out of her house. One of the movers steals a glass crystal flower. While
packing the boxes in the truck, the van accidentally moves forward, and the man who stole the
flower gets crushed by a falling box, piercing the flower in his heart , killing him (This death
bears a striking resemblance to a known urban legend where a young woman dies after a plastic
Jesus statuette she was holding in her hand while driving pierces her chest and heart after
being hit by a deployed airbag). [9 ] 193 Art Attack (a.k.a. Scrap-Nel) June 11, 2006 New York ,
NY A pervert who pretends to be a French artist to seduce women gets rejected by one of his
targets. In a rage, he punches a "sculpture" that he had made, which was made from a butterfly
bomb , that sends shrapnel into the man's body and kills him. (Based on the death of Paul Gauci,
only Gauci died when he used a butterfly bomb as a hammer.)

with him. The next morning, the jersey chaser prepares him breakfast. The football player
kept guns in hidden places around his house out of fear that someone would come after him for his
money. Not knowing that there's a gun in the oven, the jersey chaser had the oven preheated to
400 degrees, causing heat to build up pressure in the loaded gun. When the chaser opened the
oven, the gun shot her in the head with the bullet exiting out the back of her skull. 592 Descent
of a Woman (a.k.a OCDead) October 20, 2008 Tucson, Arizona A woman with obsessive-compulsive
disorder frequently cleans the inside of her house. While trying to dust off a cobweb, the
woman falls off the small stepladder and lands on top of a mirror, breaking it. She survives the
fall, but notices a glass shard from the mirror sticking out her armpit. She pulls it out, and
bleeds to death, as the glass shard was embedded in her axillary artery . 646 Scarf-Face (a.k.a
Mohammed Al-Die) January 11, 2009 Pakistani Border A terrorist, imprisoned for blowing up a
police station, starves himself for weeks so he can lose enough weight to escape prison by

criminal a large feast. The criminal eats too much way too fast, and dies of multiple organ
failure caused by refeeding syndrome . 174 Dog Dead Afternoon (a.k.a In The Doghouse)
February 10, 2006 Little Rock, Arkansas A thief targets a pit bull to steal for illegal dog
fights. The thief shoots the pit bull with a tranquilizer gun and prepares to steal it, but is
stopped when he sees a security guard. When the guard approaches the pit bull's pen, the thief
shoots him with the tranquilizer gun and the guard collapses on the door and shuts it. As the
thief tries to escape, the pit bull wakes up and bites the thief's neck, puncturing his carotid
artery and crushing his windpipe. 213 Crappy Ending (a.k.a Death-Erotica) July 18, 2007
Bangkok, Thailand While at an erotic massage parlor, a man orders a " happy ending ," but can't
ejaculate due to a strange buzzing noise from somewhere in the room. The masseuse checks the
electrical outlet and an Asian giant hornet flies out and stings the man. The man swats the
hornet, and is soon attacked by a swarm of Asian giant hornets, killing him with their venom.
439 Chain-Gang Banged (a.k.a Jail Busted) June 23, 2007 Maricopa, Arizona A couple of
prisoners from a chain gang attempt to escape in the back of a pickup truck. When the truck
approached a stop sign, they knock out the guard and hop on the back to freedom. As the pickup
truck drives off, it hits a speed bump. The prisoners fall onto the road. With their ankle
chains caught in the towing hitch, the prisoners die from being dragged along the road,
incurring severe head trauma and internal damage. 715 Withdrawn (a.k.a Bank Ruptured) March
4, 2003 Chicago, Illinois A bank robber pretending to be a victim in another's bank robbing
scheme holds a bank hostage after revealing a bomb around his neck. Two policemen arrive, and
the bank robber threatens to blow himself up if the police come any closer. One of the bank
tellers panics and runs out to her car. As she activates her car alarm (which coincidentally is
on the same radio frequency as the bank robber's neck bomb), the bank robber's bomb detonates
and his head explodes. (This death is based on the death of Brian Wells .)
