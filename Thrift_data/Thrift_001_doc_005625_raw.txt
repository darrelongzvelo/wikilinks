Notes on Pronunciation

    

    1 - One of the major characteristics of French pronunciation is the usage of what we call in
    French liaisons . Liaisons are links between words. As mentioned in the first lesson
    (“Guidelines for French Pronunciation”), most of the time, the final character of a
    word is not pronounced. This rule is generally true but its scope is limited to separate
    words. When words are assembled in a sentence, this rule is no longer applicable.
    Consider two words, for instance trois (three) and enfant (child). Each separate word is
    pronounced like this :

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif trois ,

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif enfant .
    When put side by side (trois enfants), both words are pronounced as if they were linked
    together in only one word like this

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif
    trois_enfants [troisenfan] . That’s what we call a liaison . In the next lessons,
    liaisons will be indicated by an underscore “_”, but keep in mind that the words
    linked by a liaison are two separate words.

        You cannot use liaison between all words. A liaison takes place only when the first
        word terminates with a consonant and when the second word begins with a vowel. For
        example there is no liaison between trois (three) and voiture (car). In addition,
        some consonants do not sound a normal way when pronounced in a liaison.

        2 - d sounds as t e.g.

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif
        grand_enfant [grantenfan] (tall child),

        

    

    

    - x sounds as z e.g.

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif
    deux_enfants [deuzenfan] (two children),

        Unfortunately, as any good rule, the liaison rules have lots of exceptions. In
        particular, some liaisons don’t sound good or sound very weird to a French ear and
        must be avoided. No logic can help non French speaking people know whether a liaison
        must or must not be done. I suggest you to rely on the indications I am going to add in the
        further lessons, as mentioned above (underscore character). To get liaison
        instructions for the conversation above, click here .

            1 - The consonant combination ll is very frequent in French. The way you heave to
            pronounce it depends on the character that precedes “ll” :

            2 - when preceded by a i , “ll” is pronounced the same way as in Spanish, i.e.
            like a “y”.

            

            3 - when preceded by a e , “ll” is pronounced like a “l” but changes the
            sound of the “e” to “Ãš”.

            

            4 - when preceded by any other vowel (i.e. a, o, u), “ll” is pronounced like a
            single “l”.

            

        

        

    

    

        - Let’s apply this rule to some words introduced in this lesson :

        -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif
        famille [famiye] (family),

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif
        fille [fiye] (daughter, girl)

        

        -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif je
        m’appelle [apÃšle] (I am called), elle [Ãšl'] (she)

        

        -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif
        balle [bal'] (ball)

        

    

    

    

    - When you went through the above conversation you may have noticed a new strange and weird
    character : Ã§ . “Ã§” is called c cÃ©dille [ssÃ©diye] and is pronounced like
    two “s”. Therefore garÃ§on is pronounced [garsson]. Some other usual words have a
    Ã§ like : Ã§a (this),

    

    - The word fils (son) is pronounced as if the “l” was absent [fiss].

    



Notes on Vocabulary

    

    1 - French people have a prÃ©nom and a nom . The prÃ©nom is the first name (USA) or given
    name (UK) while the nom is the last name (USA) or surname (UK). The Pierre’s prÃ©nom is
    Pierre. His nom is Dupont. The last name (or surname) is also referred to as nom de famille
    (family name).

    

        2 - To express the age of people, French people don’t use the verb Ãªtre (to be) as
        English people do but the verb avoir (to have) instead. Thus, we say :

        3 - J’ai vingt ans (I am twenty)

        

        4 - Tu as vingt ans (you are twenty)

        

        5 - Il/elle a vingt ans (He/she/it is twenty)

        

        6 - Nous avons vingt ans (We are twenty)

        

        7 - Vous avez vingt ans (You are twenty)

        

        8 - Ils/elles ont vingt ans (They are twenty)

        

    

    

    - Note that in French, one asks the age of people using the following form : quel &acircge
    as-tu ? (literally : what age do you have ?).

    



Grammar



The conversation above illustrates two grammatical points : the usage of the genitive and the
possessive pronouns

Genitive



    What is genitive ? Genitive is the grammatical name of something very simple, in fact.
    Genitive denotes the ownership. In English the ownership is indicated by adding ‘s to
    the owner when it is a human being, or by using of when the owner is a thing. For example :

    - Mr Dupont has two children, Pierre and Caroline. We can say that Pierre and Caroline are
    Mr Dupont’s children .

    

    - When talking about the wheels which belong to a car we say : the wheels of the car (and not
    the car’s wheels).

    



    In English, ‘s and of are used to denote the genitive form. In French, the genitive form
    is indicated by de in the same way as the English of . For instance :

    - Monsieur Dupont a deux enfants, Pierre et Caroline ( Mr Dupont has two children, Pierre
    and Caroline ). Pierre et Caroline sont les enfants de Monsieur Dupont (Pierre and
    Caroline are Mr Dupont’s children).

    

    - Les roues de la voiture (the wheels of the acr).

    



In French, de is used to express ownership for either persons and things (or animals).

Possessive Pronouns



In English possessive pronouns are : my, your, his/her/its, our, your, their . Their French
counterpart are more complex because they depend on the gender and the number of the object
owned by the owner. For example, when I talk about my bicycle (vÃ©lo in French) I say mon
vÃ©lo because vÃ©lo is a masculine singular noun. When talking about my car (voiture in
French) I say ma voiture because voiture is a feminine singular noun. When talking about my
shoes (chaussures in French) I say mes chaussures because chaussures is a plural noun. The
following table shows how the possessive pronouns vary according to the gender and the
number. Note that when plural, the possessive pronoun is the same whatever the gender.

---------------------------------------- Possessive masculine feminine plural
Pronoun singular singular ---------------------------------------- my mon ma mes your
ton ta tes his/her/its son sa ses our notre notre nos your votre votre vos their leur leur leurs
----------------------------------------



Note that as opposed to English, the French possessive pronouns don’t depend on the gender
of the owner. Consider the Mr and Mrs Dupont’s car. Both Mr and Mrs Dupont say, when talking
about their car : ma voiture .

    In addition, let’s review the sentences structure. The above conversation contains
    two kinds of sentence structure : normal and interrogative.

    - normal sentence : Monsieur et Madame Dupont ont deux enfants. The components are : the
    subject (Monsieur et Madame Dupont), the verb (ont) and the accusative or complÃ©ment
    d’objet direct , thus following the general pattern : SUBJECT + VERB + ACCUSATIVE

    

    - interrogative sentence : OÃ¹ est-ce que tu habites ? Where the subject is “tu”,
    the verb is “habites” and the interrogative conjunction is “oÃ¹”. The
    sentence pattern is CONJUNCTION + est-ce que + VERB + SUBJECT ? Note that the teacher could
    have used the other interrogative sentence pattern : OÃ¹ habites-tu ? (CONJUNCTION +
    VERB + SUBJECT).

3. Notes o n Vocabulary



Countries and Citizenship



In French, as in English, the first character of country names must be uppercase, while the
uppercase is not required for the citizenship. Example (refer to the ” additional
vocabulary ” section for more country names) :

Country Citizenship ------------------------------------------------- France
franÃ§ais (French) Belgique (Belgium) belge (Belgian) Suisse (Switzerland) suisse
(Swiss) Angleterre (England) anglais (English) Allemagne (Germany) allemand (German)
Italie (Italy) italien (Italian) Espagne (Spain) espagnol (Spanish) Irlande (Ireland)
irlandais (Irish) Russie (Russia) russe (russian) Ã‰tats Unis d'AmÃ©rique (USA)
amÃ©ricain (American) Canada (Canada) canadien (Canadian) QuÃ©bec (Quebec)
quÃ©bÃ©cois (Quebecer) Chine (China) chinois (Chinese) Japon (Japan) japonnais
(Japanese)



    Note that, as opposed to English, the citizenship cannot be easily derived from the
    country name. Citizenship is similar to an adjectif [je suis franÃ§ais (I am French)].
    Consequently, citizenship must be in accordance with the gender and the number of the
    people considered. Example :

    - Elle est anglaise (She is English)

    

    - Mes amis sont amÃ©ricains (My friends are American)

    

    - Les chinois et les chinoises ne sont pas grands (Chinese men and women are not tall)

    



As same as citizenship, the way French people call the inhabitants of a city is not straight
forward. The list below provides some examples :

City Inhabitant ------------------------------------------- Paris parisien
Marseilles marseillais Lyon lyonnais Lille lillois Toulouse toulousain Bruxelles
bruxellois GenÃšve (Geneva) genÃšvois Rome romain Londres (London) londonien Berlin
berlinois New York new-yorkais PÃ©kin (Beijing) pÃ©kinois



There are some striking irregular examples :

City Inhabitant ------------------------------------------- Saint Ã‰tienne
stÃ©phanois Saint Malo malouin Bordeaux bordelais Madrid madrilÃšne Moscou moscovite



Prepositions de and Ã 



    When used with verbs expressing a movement, the preposition de means from , while Ã 
    means to . Therefore, they are both key prepositions in French language. Examples :

    - venir de (to come from)

    

    - aller Ã  (to go to)

    



More precisely, de and Ã  refer to locations and not to movements. de refers to the origine of
the movement and Ã  refers to the destination. To illustrate that, consider the following
expression : d’ici Ã  lÃ  [d'ici is the contraction of de ici ] which means from here to
there (ici = here, lÃ  = there).

Note that de and Ã  have both different meanings depending on the verb they are associated
with or their role in the sentence. For instance, we have already mentioned (see lesson 6) that
de is used to express the genitive relationship between two words.

3. Notes o n Vocabulary



To be right / to be wrong



The French counterparts of the English to be right and to be wrong are avoir raison and avoir
tort. While in English one uses the verb to be in French one uses avoir (to have).

Emphasizing Questions



Consider the following question : Is this car expensive ? You ask this question because you
don’t have any idea of the price of the car being considered. You expect that the person we are
talking to tells you the price of the car. Now, imagine you already know the price of the car, and
it is really expensive. You surely don’t ask your question the same way. You would probably
say : This car is expensive. Isn’t it ?

In French it is possible to emphasize your questions the same way. The normal interrogative
form is : Est-ce que cette voiture est chÃšre ? But, if you already know that it is expensive
and emphasize the fact that it is expensive you could say : Cette voiture est chÃšre.
N’est-ce pas ? In the latter sentence, n’est-ce pas plays exactly the same role as the
English isn’t it. There is, however, a difference between the English and the French form.

It is …



The expression it is is translated in French by Cela est or more currently by the contracted
form C’est. To some extent, cela or c’ plays a similar role as it. However, cela must not be
considered as the impersonal pronoun. There is no impersonal pronoun in French ( it in
English) because things and animals are either masculine or feminine.

    Examples :

    - C’est une belle voiturre (It is a nice car)

    

    - C’est une grande maison (it is a big house)

    

    - C’est un homme agrÃ©able (He is a pleasant man. Literrally : It is a pleasant man).

    



4. Grammar



Comparative and Superlative Forms



Comparatives are used to compare things. A comparison can express a superiority, an
inferiority or an equality relationship. In English the comparisons are expressed as
follows :

Superiority

My car is more performant than yours.

My car is nice r than yours.

Inferiority

Your car is less performant than mine.

Your car is less nice than mine.

Equality

Your car is as performant as mine.

My car is as nice as yours.

In French, there is only one superiority comparison form built as follows, regardless the
length of the adjective :

plus + adjective + que

As we can notice, plus is equivalent to more, and que is equivalent to than.

    Examples :

    - Ma voiture est plus performante que la tienne. (note that la tienne means yours )

    

    - Ma voiture est plus belle que la tienne.

    



The inferiority form is composed like this :

moins + adjective + que

where moins plays the same role as less and que the same role as than .

    Examples :

    - Ta voiture est moins performante que la mienne. (note that la mienne means mine )

    

    - Ta voiture est moins belle que la mienne.

    



The equality comparison is formed as follows :

assi + adjective + que

where assi plays the same role as as and que the same role as as .

    Examples :

    - Ma voiture est aussi performante que la tienne.

    

    - Ta voiture est aussi belle que la mienne.

    



Note that, the adjectuve must respect the concordance rules with the gender and the number.

Superlatives are used to denote the highest degree of an adjective (or an adverb). In English,
superlatives are built up by appending an adjective with the termination -est or by adding
most before. In French, the superlaive form of an adjective is derived by adding plus before.
Note that plus plays a similar role as most in English. However, while in English, the
superlative is preceded by the definte article the, in French, the definte article must be in
accordance with the gender and the number of the noun(s) it refers to.

    Examples :

    - Ma voiture est la plus performante.

    

    - Ma voiture est la plus belle.

    



    Examples :

    - Ta voiture est la moins performante.

    

    - Ma voiture est la moins belle.

    



    These rules are very simple and apply to almost every adjective. Unfortunately there are
    a few exceptions, as in English !

        - bon (good)

        - superiority comparative : mieux que

        

        - inferiority comparative : moins bon/bonne que

        

        - equality comparative : aussi bon/bonne que

        

        - superiority superlative : le/la meilleur/meilleure

        

        - inferiority superlative : le/la moins bon

        

    

    

        - mauvais (bad)

        - superiority comparative : pire que or plus mauvais que (both are correct)

        

        - inferiority comparative : moins mauvais/mauvaise que

        

        - equality comparative : aussi mauvais/mauvaise que

        

        - superiority superlative : le/la pire or le/la plus mauvais/mauvaise

        

        - inferiority superlative : le/la moins mauvais/mauvaise

        

    

    



Expressing a wish

English.

The conditional present conjugation for aimer (to like) and vouloir (to want) is listed
below.

6. Ordinal Numbers



In French, ordinal numbers are directly derived from the numbers by appending iÃšme . There
is only one exception : the French counterpart of first is not uniÃšme but premier .

    Notes

    1 - there are some irregular numbers which result in a minor alteration of the spelling
    (e.g. ninth is neuviÃšme instead of neufiÃšme , fifth is cinquiÃšme instead of
    cinqiÃšme ) .

    

    2 - 21st, 31st, 41st, etc. are translated by vingt-et-uniÃšme, trente-et-uniÃšme,
    quarante-et-uniÃšme, etc. and not vingt-premier, trente-premier,
    quarante-premier, etc. as in English !

    

    

    - premier (first)

    

    - deuxiÃšme or second (second)

    

    - troisiÃšme (third)

    

    - quatriÃšme (fourth)

    

    - cinquiÃšme (fifth)

    

    - sixiÃšme (sixth)

    

    - septiÃšme (seventh)

    

    - huitiÃšme (eighth)

    

    - neuviÃšme (ninth)

    

    - dixiÃšme (tenth)

    

    - onziÃšme (eleventh)

    

    - douziÃšme (twelveth)

    

    - treiziÃšme (thirteenth)

    

    - quatortziÃšme (forteenth)

    

    - quinziÃšme (fifteenth)

    

    - seiziÃšme (sixteenth)

    

    - dix-septiÃšme (seventeenth)

    

    - dix-huitiÃšme (eighteenth)

    

    - dix-neuviÃšme (nineteenth)

    

    - vingtiÃšme (twentieth)

    

    - vingt-et-uniÃšme (twenty first)

    

    - centiÃšme (hendredth)

    

    - milliÃšme (thousandth)

    



The abbreviated notation of the ordinal numbers is : 1er (1st), 2iÃšme (2nd), 3iÃšme
(3rd), 4iÃšme (4th), 21iÃšme (21st), 31iÃšme (31st), 100iÃšme (100th),
101iÃšme (101st), etc.

Lesson 9 – Le temps (Time)



Whether time is the fourth dimension of the Universe – as suggested by modern physics – or a
bio-physical process which makes events irreversible, it is a reality which nobody can
reject ! As a matter of fact, the way people apprehend time is strongly reflected in the human
languages. In the Western European languages (these are the only languages I can talk about)
time is basically composed of two concepts : the instant and the duration. The languages try to
address these two basic concepts with an arsenal of verb tenses. Although the main principles
are the same, there are sound and subtle differencies between languages in the way they
express time. First, let’s talk about the common concepts.

Time can be thought as a one-dimension rule where events occur. A point, or a specific position
on the rule is an instant while the space between two instants is a duration . I am sure that you
are very familiar with these definitions. The time – the position on the time rule – of our
conscience is the reference point : it is present time. Before it is the past and after, the
future. In the Western European languages, the basic verb tenses directly reflect this
partition of time : they make provision of present, past and future tenses. However, present,
past and future depict only the position - the instants – of events relative to the reference
point (our conscience). Expressing the duration is subtler and vary very strongly from one
language to an other one.

Grammar



    In French, there are 4 past tenses :

    - l’imparfait,

    

    - le passÃ© simple,

    

    - le passÃ© composÃ©,

    

    - le plus-que-parfait.

    



The passÃ© simple won’t be addressed in this lesson for it is not used in the spoken
language (today, the passÃ© simple is exclusively employed in literrary works such as
novels). The three other past tenses are commonly used in both the spoken and the written
language. The most popular of them is the passÃ© composÃ©. So, let’s start with it.

1. The passÃ© composÃ©



The passÃ© composÃ© is the most popular but not the simpler past tense. As suggested by its
name ( passÃ© composÃ© means composed past), the passÃ© composÃ© is built up using an
auxiliary verb. In French, as opposed to English and Germanic languages, there are two
possible auxiliary verbs : avoir (to have) and Ãªtre (to be). Basically, the passÃ©
composÃ© is constructed following the pattern below :

auxiliary verb conjugated in the present tense + verb in past participle

Examples :

    manger (past participle : mangÃ©) :

    - j’ ai mangÃ©

    

    - tu as mangÃ©

    

    - il/elle a mangÃ©

    

    - nous avons mangÃ©

    

    - vous avez mangÃ©

    

    - ils/elles ont mangÃ©

    



    aller (past participle : allÃ©) :

    - je suis allÃ©(e)

    

    - tu es allÃ©(e)

    

    - il/elle est allÃ©/allÃ©e

    

    - nous sommes allÃ©s (es)

    

    - vous Ãªtes allÃ©s (es)

    

    - ils/elles sont allÃ©s/allÃ©es

    



    Notes :

    1 - In French, the past participle of the 1st group verbs (verbs ending with -er) is derived
    from the infinitive tense by replacing the infinitive ending (-er) by -Ã©. This rule is
    always applicable … for the 1st group verbs only !

    

    2 - When conjugated with the auxiliary avoir the past participle remains unchanged
    whatever the subject is ( mangÃ© in case of the verb manger ) while when the auxiliary
    Ãªtre is required, the past participle changes in accordance with the gender and the
    number of the subject, as shown in the example above. We’re going back to this remarks
    later on.

    

    3 - There is, unfortunately, no rule to help people determine whether a verb conjougates
    with the auxiliary avoir or Ãªtre. There are some hints but no rigourous rule. We’re
    going through them later on.

    



The PassÃ© ComposÃ© Usage



    The passÃ© composÃ© is used to express actions which took place in the past and are
    completed . In addition, to some extent, there may be a link, or a relationship between
    this past action and the present. For instance, the past action may have consequences in
    the present, or the past action took place in a period which is not completed yet – though
    the action itself is completed – (such a period can be an hour, a day, a week, the duration
    of a special event, etc.). In general, the passÃ© composÃ© does not bear any duration
    information by itself : the action may have been very long or very short. The duration
    information – if required – must be added explicitly (see 5th example below).

    - Hier, j’ ai dÃ©jeunÃ© Ã  1 heure (Yesterday, I lunched at one o’clock) : the
    lunch is now finished ! (the action of lunching is completed)

    

    - L’annÃ©e derniÃšre, elle a visitÃ© le Canada (Last year, she visited Canada) :
    the action of visiting Canada is now finished.

    

    - L’avion est arrivÃ© Ã  11 heures (The airplane has arrived at 11 o’clock) : the
    airplane is now arrived (the action of arriving is completed)

    

    - Hier, j’ ai mangÃ© avec mon meilleur ami (Yesterday, I ate with my best friend) : the
    action of eating is now completed

    

    - J’ ai attendu le bus pendant vingt minutes (I’ve waited for the bus for twenty
    minutes) : the action of waiting is now completed.

    

    - Ce matin, j’ ai lu un livre (This morning, I read a book) : the book is now read (the action
    of reading is completed) and, in addition, the period of time (the current day in this
    example) is not completed.

    

    - J’ ai apprÃ©ciÃ© ton cadeau (I have appreciated your present) : the action of
    appreciating is completed but the resulting feeling (good appreciation) is still alive
    in the present time.

    



The Past Participle in French



    Basically, past participle is fairly simple in French but there are lots of irregular
    verbs which make it more complicated than it seems at the first look. Remember the 3rd
    lesson dedicated to verbs : there are three verb groups in French.

    - the 1st group : verbs ending with -er (aller, parler, manger, chanter, etc.),

    

    - the 2nd group : verbs ending with -ir (finir, courrir, bÃ¢tir, etc.),

    

    - the 3rd group : verbs ending with -re (vendre, boire, rire, etc.).

    



The past participle for the 1st verb group is built by replacing the infinitive ending by -Ã©
. e.g. : Infinitive Past Participle manger (to eat) mangÃ© chanter (to sing) chantÃ©
aller (to go) allÃ© jouer (to play) jouÃ©

The past participle for the 2nd verb group is built by replacing the infinitive ending by -i .
e.g. : Infinitive Past Participle finir (to finish) fini grandir (to grow) grandi choisir (to
choose) choisi sortir (to go out) sorti partir (to leave) parti

But there some major exceptions such as : Infinitive Past Participle courir (to run) couru
couvrir (to cover) couvert

The 3nd group verbs are strongly irregular. However, in many cases, the past participle is
obtained by replacing the infinitive ending by -u. e.g. : Infinitive Past Participle vendre
(to sell) vendu boire (to drink) bu prendre (to take) pris voire (to see) vu entendre (to hear)
entendu vivre (to live) vÃ©cu mettre (to put) mis

    The past participles for the verbs Ãªtre and avoir are :

    - Ãªtre (to be) : Ã©tÃ© (been)

    

    - avoir (to have) : eu (had)

    



You’ll find a list of past participles at the end of this lesson.

The Past Participle Concordance rules



    The past participle concordance rules are certainly one of the most complicated aspects
    of the written French. There are two basic rules :

    - the concordance rule for the verbs which conjugate with the auxiliary Ãªtre,

    

    - the concordance rule for the verbs which conjugate with the auxiliary avoir.

    



Let’s startwith the simplest one :

Concordance rule for the verbs which conjugate with the auxiliary Ãªtre

    Rule : the past participle ot the verbs which conjugate with the auxiliary Ãªtre is in
    concordance with the gender and the number of the subject of the verb. The concordance
    complies with the adjective concordance rules (the feminine is formed by appending a -e
    and the plural by appending a -s). e.g.:

    - Ils sont allÃ© s en AmÃ©rique l’annÃ©e derniÃšre (They went to America last
    year) : ” ils ” is masculine plural.

    

    - Elle est arrivÃ© e en retard Ã  l’Ã©cole (literally : she arrived late at
    school. She was late at school) : Elle is feminine.

    

    - Le camion et la voiture sont arrivÃ© s Ã  l’heure (the truck and the car arrived on
    time) : there are two items (the truck and the car) so that the subject is plural. One of the
    item is masculine (le camion) then the concordance rule applied is the macho rule (the
    masculine wins over the feminine).

    



Concordance rule for the verbs which conjugate with the auxiliary avoir

    Rule : the past participle of the verbs which conjugate with the auxiliary avoir is in
    concordance with the gender and the number of the complÃ©ment d’objet if it is placed
    before the verb (!!!) otherwise, the past participle remains unchanged. The
    concordance complies with the adjective concordance rules (the feminine is formed by
    appending a -e and the plural by appending a -s). e.g.:

    - Elle a mangÃ© des oranges (She has eaten oranges) : the complÃ©ment d’objet is
    ornages. It is placed after the verb, so that the past participle is not in concordance
    with it.

    

    - Les oranges qu’elle a mangÃ© es sont bonnes (The oranges she has eaten are good) : the
    complÃ©ment d’objet is oranges. It is placed before the verb, so that the past
    participle is in concordance with the gender (orange is feminine in French) and number
    (orange s is plural) of the complÃ©ment d’objet.

    



Determining the right auxiliary



    Most of the verbs conjugate in passÃ© composÃ© with the auxiliray avoir. However,
    the number of verbs which require the auxiliary Ãªtre is not negligable. There is no
    reliable rule to determine whether a verb conjugate with the auxiliary Ãªtre or avoir.
    Nevertheless, there are some hints which can help you use the right auxiliary. The verbs
    which conjugate with the auxiliary Ãªtre are :

    1 - the ” pronominal ” verbs (verbes pronominaux),

    

    2 - the ” intransitive ” verbs (verbes intransitifs) which express a movement or a
    change of state

    



    The concepts of pronominal and in transitive verbs will be discussed in detail later on
    this course. However, to clarify the previous rules, let’s give the following
    definition :

    - a pronominal verb is reflexive i.e., it directly applies to the subject. In English, the
    pronominal verbs are those which require myself, yourself, himself, herself,
    ourselves, themselves. e.g. : I wash myself, you watch yourself in the mirror, he kills
    himself, etc. In French, the pronominal verbs are distinguished by se in front of them in
    the infinitive form. e.g. se laver (to wash oneself), se regerder (to watch oneself), se
    tuer (to kill oneself), se promener (to walk), s’habiller (to wear), etc. As you see,
    some verbs are transitive in French and not in English.

    

    - a intransitive verb is a verb wich does not require a complÃ©ment d’objet (an
    accusative). Conversely, the verbs which require a complÃ©ment d’objet are called
    transitive . e.g.

    

transitive verbs conjugation example manger (to eat) je mange un bon repas (I am eating a good
meal) chanter (to sing) Je chante une chanson (I am singing a song) boire (to drink) je bois un
verre de vin (I’m drinking a glass of wine) intransitive verbs conjugation example aller
(to go) je vais Ã  l’Ã©cole (I’m going to school) voler (to fly) l’avion vole (the
airplane flies) rouler (to run) la voiture roule (the car runs)

    So, the main intranstive verbs which must be conjugated with the auxiliary Ãªtre are :

    - aller (to go)

    

    - arriver (to arrive)

    

    - devenir (to become)

    

    - entrer (to get in, to get into)

    

    - mourrir (to die)

    

    - naÃ®tre (to be born)

    

    - partir (to leave)

    

    - rester (to stay)

    

    - sortir (to get off, te get out of)

    

    - tomber (to fall)

    

    - venir (to come)

    



2. The Imparfait



The imparfait is the second most popular past tense in French. As opposed to passÃ©
composÃ©, it is very easy to conjugate for it does not need any auxiliary verb. The imparfait
conjugation pattern is similar to the present tense one with some alterations.

Conjugation of the 1st group verbs



    chanter (to sing)

    - je chantais

    

    - tu chantais

    

    - il/elle chantait

    

    - nous chantions

    

    - vous chantiez

    

    - ils/elles chantaient

    



    parler (to speak, to talk)

    - je parlais

    

    - tu parlais

    

    - il/elle parlait

    

    - nous parlions

    

    - vous parliez

    

    - ils/elles parlaient

    



    Ã©couter (to listen to)

    - j’Ã©coutais

    

    - tu Ã©coutais

    

    - il/elle Ã©coutait

    

    - nous Ã©coutions

    

    - vous Ã©coutiez

    

    - ils/elles Ã©coutaient

    



    You can clearly see the conjugation pattern applying to the the termination of the 1st
    group verbs.

    - 1st person singular : -ais

    

    - 2nd person singular : -ais

    

    - 3rd person singular : -ait

    

    - 1st person plural : -ions

    

    - 2nd person plural : -iez

    

    - 3rd person plural : -aient

    



    Now, let’s try ” aller ” which irregular in present tense :

    - j’allais

    

    - tu allais

    

    - il/elle allait

    

    - nous allions

    

    - vous alliez

    

    - ils/elles allaient

    



In the imparfait, ” aller ” is no longer irregular. That’s a good news !

Conjugation of the 2nd group verbs



    finir (to finish)

    - je finissais

    

    - tu finissais

    

    - il/elle finissait

    

    - nous finissions

    

    - vous finissiez

    

    - ils/elles finissaient

    



    venir (to come)

    - je venais

    

    - tu venais

    

    - il/elle venait

    

    - nous venions

    

    - vous veniez

    

    - ils/elles venaient

    



    vouloir (to want)

    - je voulais

    

    - tu voulais

    

    - il/elle voulait

    

    - nous voulions

    

    - vous vouliez

    

    - ils/elles voulaient

    



Once again, the conjugation of 2nd group verbs respect some kind of termination pattern,
however, less obvious than in the 1st group. Some of the 2nd group verbs conjugate like ”
finir ” (termination pattern : -ssais, -ssais, -ssait, -ssions, -ssiez, -ssaient) and
others, like ” venir “conjugate as the 1st group verbs. Once again, you may have noticed
that the imparfait conjugation is less irregular than the present tense.

Conjugation of the 3rd group verbs



    boire (to drink)

    - je buvais

    

    - tu buvais

    

    - il/elle buvait

    

    - nous buvions

    

    - vous buviez

    

    - ils/elles buvaient

    



    vendre (to sell)

    - je vendais

    

    - tu vendais

    

    - il/elle vendait

    

    - nous vendions

    

    - vous vendiez

    

    - ils/elles vendaient

    



    vivre (to live)

    - je vivais

    

    - tu vivais

    

    - il/elle vivait

    

    - nous vivions

    

    - vous viviez

    

    - ils/elles vivaient

    



The 3rd group is still a mess but less than in the present tense.They respect the same
termination pattern as the 1st group verbs (-ais, -ais, -ait, -ions, -iez, -aient) but might
be subject to some alteration. However, in most cases, the alteration is very simple : the
infinitive termination -re is dropped and replaced by the conjugation termination.

” Ãªtre ” (to be) and ” avoir ” (to have)



The auxiliary verbs Ãªtre and avoir are as irregular in imparfait as in the present tense.
Let’s take a close look at them.

    Ãªtre (to be)

    - j’Ã©tais

    

    - tu Ã©tais

    

    - il/elle Ã©tait

    

    - nous Ã©tions

    

    - vous Ã©tiez

    

    - ils/elles Ã©taient

    



    avoir (to have)

    - j’avais

    

    - tu avais

    

    - il/elle avait

    

    - nous avions

    

    - vous aviez

    

    - ils/elles avaient

    



Imparfait Usage



    Basically, the imparfait tense is used to express actions which were in progress in a past
    portion of time, whithout specifying with precision when they began and when they
    completed. In general, the imparfait is used when the action has taken a certain amount of
    time, i.e. it was not an instant action. Examples :

    - Je marchais silencieusement dans la rue (I was silently walking on the street)

    

    - A cette Ã©poque, je vivais pauvrement (At this time, I was living poorly)

    



Most of the time, the imparfait is employed in French in place of the progressive past
(progressive preterit) in English. This rule works very well.

Time on the Clock



The common way to ask for the time in French is :

Quelle heure est-il ? (What time is it ? literally : what hour is it)

The answer is :



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/2h.gif

Il est deux heures (it is two o’clock)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h.gif

Il est trois heures (it is three o’clock)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h5.gif

Il est trois heures cinq (it is five past three)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h10.gif

Il est trois heures dix (it is ten past three)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h15.gif

Il est trois heures et quart (it is a quarter past three)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h20.gif

Il est trois heures vingt (it is twenty past three)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h25.gif

Il est trois heures vingt-cinq (it is twenty five past three)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h30.gif

Il est trois heures et demi (it is half past three)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h35.gif

Il est quatre heures moins vingt-cinq (it is twenty five to four)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h40.gif

Il est quatre heures moins vingt (it is twenty to four)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h45.gif

Il est quatre heures moins le quart (it is a quarter to four)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h50.gif

Il est quatre heures moins dix (it is ten to four)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/3h55.gif

Il est quatre heures moins cinq (it is five to four)



Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/midi.gif

Il est midi (it is noon, 12:00 am) or

Il est minuit (it is midnight, 12:00 pm)

    As you see, French people express the time in a way similar to English people. There are
    some – minor differencies however :

    1 - for the first half hour : il est cinq heures vingt could be literally translated as it is
    five hours plus twenty minutes.

    

    2 - for the second half hour : il est cinq heures moins dix could be literally translated by
    it is five hours minus ten minutes.

    



The French counterparts of quarter and half are respectively quart and demi.

    To distinguish the time in the morning and in the afternoon, English people use the
    abbreviations a.m. (ante meridiem) and p.m.(post meridiem). French people don’t use
    these abbreviations. In French, the time in the morning and in the afternoon are
    specified by respectively adding du matin (in the morning) or de l’aprÃšs-midi (in
    the afternoon) after the time. Examples :

    - trois heures du matin = 3:00 am

    

    - cin heures et demi de l’aprÃšs-di = 5:30 pm

    



In addition, there is a more formal way to make this distinction which works like this : Time on
the clock French time 1:00 am une heure 1:00 pm treize heures (13:00) 2:00 am deux heures 2:00 pm
quatorze heures (14:00) 2:15 am deux heures quinze 2:15 pm quatorze heures quinze (14:15)
2:30 am deux heures trente 2:30 pm quatorze heures trente (14:30) 2:45 am deux heures quarante
cinq 2:45 pm quatorze heures quarante cinq (14:45) 2:50 am deux heures cinquante 2:50 pm
quatorze heures cinquante (14:50) 12:00 am douze heures or midi 12:00 pm minuit

This way of expressing the time is utilized in the train stations, the airports, at work, in any
sort of time-tables. But in the day-to-day life, people prefer to say trois heures de
l’aprÃšs-midi rather than quinze heures.

Lesson 1 – Pronunciation guidelines



A written course in not the best suited means to learn how to pronounce a language, especially
when you have never heard it. In addition, the way people pronounce their own language may
tremendously vary from one place to another and is strongly dependent on the local culture,
customs and neighbouring influences. This remark is particularly true for French language :
there are startling pronunciation differences between the French spoken in southern
France, in northern France, in Belgium, in Switzerland, in QuÃ©bec and in the many French
speaking African countries (Marocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Senegal, Ivory Coast, ZaÃ¯re,
Burundi, Rwanda, Cameroon, Gabon, Niger, Burkina Fasso, Tchad, etc.), in such a way that
people may not understand each other! So, you understand that we have to agree on a standard.
Hopefully, such a standard exists and is commonly referred to as “international French”
also improperly called “Parisian French”. The aim of this first lesson is to give you
guidelines for the pronunciation of the main French sounds, i.e. single vowels, vowels
combinations and the consonants whose pronunciation differs from the English one. This is
not an exhaustive description of the French pronunciation since it does not make any sense to
try to cover all aspects of the pronunciation of a language until you can hear the actual
sounds.

As mentioned above, learning how to pronounce a language from a written course is a tough job.
Some of you have suggested to include sound files in the text to ease the comprehension of the
following lesson. It is now available !!! To take advantage of this new feature, you are
required to have the software MPLAYER.EXE on your PC since the format of the sound files is
.WAV. MPLAYER comes with the multimedia kit of WINDOWS 3.x.

The letters or the words you can hear are indicated by the following sign

Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif .

So, French pronunciation will be no longer a dark mystery for you !!!

For MAC users, a freeware called SoundApp is able to read and play various sound file formats.
Especially, it can convert WAV files into Macintosh AIFF or SND files. Click here to download
it from MIT. Also, for UNIX users, the SOX program converts WAV files into AU files. Click here
to download it from the Netherlands. Though English and French share a good bunch of words,
their pronunciation is completely different. Moreover, in French there are some sounds that
does not even exist in English. Let’s start with the vowels.

1. Single vowels

    

    -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif a

        - Pronunciation: like the first “a” in “marmalade” or in “heart”, but
        just a little bit less open.

        

        - Examples: table (table), sac (bag), chat (cat), rat (rat), baggage (luggage), sa
        (his/her), bras (arm), matin (morning).

        

        - Similar sounds: Ã¢ (more open than a )

        

    

    

    -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif e

        - Pronunciation: like the indefinite article “a” in English with a sharper
        sound, or like the second a in “marmalade”.

        

        - Examples: cheveu (hair), deux (two), second [segon] (second), oeuvre (work, as in
        master works), soeur (sister), heure (hour), beurre (butter).

        

        - Similar sounds: “eu” and “oeu”. The latter one is more open than e and eu .

        

    

    

    -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif i

        - Pronunciation: like the English “ee” but shorter.

        

        - Examples: pipe (pipe), minute (minute), courir (to run), midi (midday), nid
        (nest).

        

    

    

    -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif o

            - Pronunciation: two different sounds:

            1 - an open “o” more or less as the English “more” and “for”

            

            2 - a closed one like the English “go” and “low”

            

        

        

        - Most of the times the “o” in French is open. It is closed when located at the end of
        the word. Note that the difference between open and closed “o” is not as stressed
        as it is in English between the words “open” and “control”.

        

            - Examples:

            1 - Open o:

            Image:
            http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif botte
            (boot), grotte (cave), dÃ©velopper (to develop), homme (man)

            

            2 - Closed o:

            Image:
            http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif
            vÃ©lo (bicycle), indigo (indigo)

            

        

        

        - Similar sounds: (to a closed o): “au”, “eau”, “ÃŽ”. Examples: eau
        (water), auto (car), contrÃŽle (control).

        

    

    

    -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif u

        - Pronunciation: the French sound for “u” does not exist in English. While in
        most languages “u” is pronounced like the u in “bush”, in French it differs
        dramatically. The French “u” is exactly the same sound as the German
        “ÃŒ”. As we’re going to see later, the sound “u” as the English
        “bush” exists in French as well, but it is formed by the vowel combination
        “ou”.

        

        - Examples: voiture (car), minute, humain (human).

        

    

    

        - y

        - Pronunciation: pronounced the same way as a double French “i”.

        

        - Examples: noyer [noi-ier] (to drown), rayer [rai-ier] (to scratch), loyer
        [loi-ier] (lease), pays [pai-i] (country).

        

    

    



Notes

    

    1 - In most cases, the final e in a word is not pronounced. Examples : bouche [bouch']
    (mouth), jambe [jamb'] (leg), lampe [lamp'] (lamp).

    

    2 - When followed by a doubled consonant (l, t, p, r, m, n), e is pronounced like the English
    -ay as in “say”, “bay”, but without the glide towards i and more open. In French,
    this sound is referred to as “Ãš” (e with a grave accent). Examples : pelle
    [pÃšl'] (shovel), mettre [mÃšttr'] (to put), lettre (letter), terre [tÃšr']
    (land).

    



2. Accentuated vowels



One of the most striking differences between the French and the English words is the use of
accented characters in French. Almost every vowel – excepting “y” – can be
accentuated. Some accents change the sound of the vowel, others don’t. The accents (shown
in conjunction with the letter e) are:

- the grave accent – Ãš



- the sharp accent – Ã©



- the circumflex accent – Ãª



- the diaeresis Ã«



Accents which change the vowel sound





Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif Ã© is
pronounced like the English -ay as in “say”, “bay”, but without the glide towards i.

Same thing for

Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif Ãš and Ãª
but with a much more open sound.

Examples :

Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif frÃšre
(brother), pÃšre (father), mÃšre (mother), Ã©vÃ©nement (event),

Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif blÃ©
(wheat), bÃªte (beast or stupid),

Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif tÃªte
(head).

A diaeresis on an “i” makes the syllable sound as if there were two syllables. Examples :
naÃ¯f (naÃ¯ve) is pronounced [na-if] instead of [nÃšf] (ai is normally pronounced as
an Ãš in French).

Ã¢ is more open than an “a”. Example : mÃ¢cher (to chew), pÃ¢te (paste)

ÃŽ is more closed than “o”. Example : hÃŽte (host), contrÃŽle (control)

Accents which do not change the vowel sound



In all other situations, the accent does not affect the sound of the vowel i.e. : Ã , Ã« Ã®
Ã¹, ÃŒ. So, what’s the need for them? The answer is simple : no need ! But French people are
reluctant to change the spelling of their language (as English people !) as opposed to Spanish
and German people. Most of the French accentuated characters have historical origins. For
instance, the “^” was used to indicate that in old French, the vowel was followed by an
“s”. Thus, the modern French words forÃªt (forest), hÃ¢te (haste), hÃŽte (host),
pÃ¢te (paste) were spelled as follows in old French : forest, haste, hoste, paste. As you can
notice, there were identical as their English counterparts, or, more precisely, these
English words directly come from old French !

3. Vowels and consonants combinations

    

    -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif ou

        - Pronunciation: like the “u” in “bush”

        

        - Examples: bouche (mouth), genou (knee), cou (neck)

        

    

    

    -

        Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif oi

        - Pronunciation: pronounced like the combination “oa”

        

        - Examples: oie (goose), doigt [doa] (finger)

4. Consonants



    Most of consonants in French are pronounced in a fairly same way as in English, however,
    there are some exceptions. In the following list, we’re only going to review the
    consonants whose pronunciation differs in French and in English.

        General rule

    

        The following consonants : d, n, p, r, s, t, x, are generally not pronounced when
        located at the end of a word (note that they are not pronounced but they generally
        change the sound of the preceding vowels). Conversely, all the other consonants
        (i.e. the following consonants : c, f, k, l, q, z. The other consonants like b, j, g, v,
        w, etc. are rarely or never located at the end of a word) are pronounced. As many good
        rule, there are lots of exceptions ! In the progression of this course, the
        pronunciation rule will be indicated when necessary.

        Examples : trois [troi] (three), vent [ven] (wind), fonds [fon] (fund).

        Exceptions : see numbers .

    

        r

    

        The French “r” sound is fairly different from the english one. In English,
        “r” is soft, round. In contrary, in French, “r” is guttural and must be
        pronounced like Scottish people do (maybe, a little bit less guttural !).

    

        j

    

        The French “j” is pronounced like the English “g”. Examples : jardin
        (garden), jour (day).

    

        g

    

        In French, the pronunciation of “g” depends on the subsequent character. If
        followed by “a”, “u”, or “o”, “g” is pronounced like the “g” in
        “garden”. If followed by “e” or “i”, it is pronounced like the second
        “g” in “language”. Examples : langage (language), langue (tongue).

    

        gn

    

        The French sound for “gn” is very similar to the Spanish “Ã±” or like the
        sound “niÃ©”. Examples : gagner [gaÃ±Ã©] (to win), mignon [meeÃ±on]
        (cute).

    

        ch

    

        The French “ch” is pronounced like the English “sh”. Examples : chambre
        [shambr'] (room), chat (cat), chaussure (shoe).

    

        h

    

        In French, the character “h” is not pronounced when located at the beginning of a
        word. Examples : haricot [arico] (bean), homme [om'] (man), hÃ¢che [ach'] (ax)

    

        s

    

        As in English, most French words add an “s” when plural, however, the last
        “s” in a word is never pronounced. Examples : maison and its plural form maisons
        are pronounced the same way. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule, for
        instance, plus (more) is pronounced [plÃŒss].

        Notes:

    

    

    1 - the pronunciation rules which apply to “s” and “ss” when located within a
    word, are the same as in English.

    

    2 - when a word begins with an “s”, the “s” is pronounced like “ss” (soft
    “s”). It is actually the same rule as in English.

Lesson 2 – Articles and Genders



1. Gender in French



We have a bad and a good news for you : as opposed to English, French words have a gender. That’s
the bad news. The good news is that French words can have only two genders : masculine or
feminine. Unfortunately, there is an additional bad news : the distribution of the words in
the masculine and the feminine genders does not comply to any logical rule. Therefore, the
only way to know the gender of a word is to learn it by heart!

    The gender is determined by the article, either definite ( the in English) or indefinite (
    a/an in English).

    - Masculine definite article:

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif le [leu]

    

    - Feminine definite article:

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif la

    

    - Masculine indefinite article:

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif un
    [nasal sound which can be derived from the English sound "un" as explained in the first
    lesson]

    

    - Feminine indefinite article:

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif une
    [?n']

    



    The genders of the words introduced in the previous lesson are :

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif la/une

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif la main

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif le/un
    pain (the/a bread)

    

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif la/une
    tasse (the/a cup)

    



    When a word begins with a vowel, the definite article that precedes the word is contracted
    whatever the gender is :

    - une assiette (a plate), l’assiette (the plate)

    

    - un oiseau (a bird), l’oiseau (the bird)

    

    - un animal (an animal)l’animal (the animal)

    

    - une araÃ®gnÃ©e (a spider), l’araÃ®gnÃ©e (the spider)

    

    - une auto (a car), l’auto (the car)

    



Previously, we said that there was no logical rules to find out the gender of the French words.
Actually, there are some…

Professions



    Almost every profession has two genders depending on whether it is a man or a woman who is
    accomplishing the work. Examples :

        un boulanger

    

        a male baker

    

        une boulangÃšre

    

        a female baker

    

        un boucher

    

        a male butcher

    

        une bouchÃšre

    

        a female butcher

    



    The following list gives the masculine and feminine form of some professions:

        Driver

    

    

    - Masculine: un conducteur

    

    - Feminine: une conductrice

    

    

        Airplane pilot

    

    

    - Masculine: un aviateur

    

    - Feminine: une aviatrice

    

    

        Engineer

    

    

    - Masculine: un ingÃ©nieur

    

    - Feminine: une ingÃ©nieure

    

    

        Teacher

    

    

    - Masculine: un professeur

    

    - Feminine: une professeure

    

    

        President

    

    

    - Masculine: un prÃ©sident

    

    - Feminine: une prÃ©sidente

    

    

        Minister

    

    

    - Masculine: un ministre

    

    - Feminine: une ministre

    

    

        Worker

    

    

    - Masculine: un ouvrier

    

    - Feminine: une ouvriÃšre

    



Animals



    Like professions, most animals may have both genders (male and female). As opposed to
    professions, the way the female form is built does not comply to any general rule and
    consequently, must be learnt by heart. The following is a list of examples:

        Cat

    

    

    - Masculine: un chat [sha]

    

    - Feminine: une chatte [shat']

    

    

        Dog

    

    

    - Masculine: un chien [shi-in]

    

    - Feminine: une chienne [shiÃšn']

    

    

        Lion

    

    

    - Masculine: un lion [li-on]

    

    - Feminine: une lionne [li-on']

    

    

        Tiger

    

    

    - Masculine: un tigre

    

    - Feminine: une tigresse [tigrÃšs']

    

    

        Horse

    

    

    - Masculine: un cheval

    

    - Feminine: une jument

    

    

        Rabbit

    

    

    - Masculine: un lapin

    

    - Feminine: une lapine

    

    

        Rat

    

    

    - Masculine: un rat

    

    - Feminine: une rate

    

    

        Pig

    

    

    - Masculine: un porc, un cochon

    

    - Feminine: une truie [tr?-i]

    

    

        Bovine (cow/bull)

    

    

    - Masculine (bull): un taureau [toro]

    

    - Feminine (cow): une vache

    

    

        Donkey

    

    

    - Masculine: un Ã¢ne

    

    - Feminine: une Ã¢nesse

    



As you may have noticed in the previous examples, the feminine form is often derived from the
masculine by appending an “e” to the word. This rule is applicable in most cases and leads
to a more general one : the feminine form of nouns and adjectives is built by appending an
“e” to the masculine form of the word. This rule is general enough that you should learn it.

2. Plural articles



    The plural form of the definite and indefinite articles is very simple for it does not vary
    according to the gender:

    - Definite article: les (both feminine and masculine)

    

    - Undefinite article: des (both feminine and masculine)

    



    Plural rule : In French, the plural form of nouns and adjectives is built by appending an
    “s” (like in English). However, in many cases, this rule is not applicable, and you
    will be required to learn by heart the irregular form of plural form of these exceptions (
    lesson 4 ). Examples:

    - Singular: le chat

    

    - Plural: les chats

    

    - Singluar: la table

    

    - Plural: les tables

    

    - Singluar: un chien

    

    - Plural: des chiens

    

    - Singluar: une lionne

    

    - Plural: des lionnes

    

    - Singluar: un oiseau

    

    - Plural: des oiseaux

    oiseau is one of these exceptions.

    



3. Some usual expressions

    

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif merci
    (thank you)

    

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif s’il
    vous plaÃ®t (please)

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif bonsoir

    excusez-moi (excuse me)

    



Lesson 3 – Pronouns and Verbs



The verb groups



In English, the infinite tense is built by adding ” to ” in front of the verb : to say, to see,
to eat, etc. In French, the infinite tense is indicated by appending -er, -ir or -re to the verb.
Examples :

-er

parler (to talk) chanter (to sing) manger (to eat) marcher (to walk) aller (to go) Ã©couter
(to listen to) laver (to wash) commencer (to begin)

-ir

finir (to end) mourir (to die) courir (to run) sentir (to feel) avoir (to have) venir (to come)
savoir (to know) vouloir (to want)

-re

sourire (to smile) vivre (to live) boire (to drink) entendre (to hear) Ãªtre (to be)
conduire (to drive) vendre (to sell)

The verbs ending with -er are referred to as ” first group ” verbs, the verbs ending with -ir
compose the ” second group ” and the verbs with the ending -re form the ” third group “.
It is useful to distribute the verbs between these 3 groups because different conjugation
rules apply to each group as we’re going to see.

The pronouns

    

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif je (I)

    

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif tu (you
    informal form or “tutoiement” in French)

    

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif il /

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif elle
    [il/el'] (he/she it does not exist in French)

    

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif nous
    [nou] (we)

    

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif vous
    [vou] (you when talking to more than one person or formal form “vouvoiement” in
    French)

    

    -

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif ils /

    Image: http://www.jump-gate.com/languages/french/images/headphone.gif elles
    [il/el'] (they)

    



    Notes

    1 - in French, there is no neuter pronoun (” it ” in English). That means that things can
    be either masculine or feminine as we mentioned in the previous lesson,

    

    2 - in English, the 2nd person pronoun is ” you ” whether in singular or plurial.
    Formally, in French, if you talk to one single person, you use ” tu ” and if you talk to a
    group of people, you must use ” vous “. In fact, the ” tu ” form (or ” tutoiement
    ” in French) is commonly used between people of same age, or same social rank. When
    talking to a older person or to somebody above you in rank (your boss for example), you
    must, most of the time, employ the ” vous ” form (or ” vouvoiement in French). ” tu
    ” marks familiarity while ” vous ” marks respect.

    

    3 - When the verb starts with a vowel, you must use j’ instead of je.

    



Present tense



In French, there are much more verb tenses than in English. Hopefully, a large number of them
are rarely, or never, used in the spoken language. The simplest verb tense is the present which
is used to describe actions that occur in the present time. Conjugating verbs in the present
tense is very easy in English because the verb does not change, except for the 3rd singular
person where a ” s ” is appended. In French, the present tense conjugation is not so
straight forward. The verbs termination varies according to the person and the verb group and
might be altered. Let’s start with the 1st group verbs :

    - vous Ã©coutez [Ã©coutÃ©]

    

    - ils/elles Ã©coutent [Ã©cout']

    



    You can clearly see the conjugation pattern applying to the the termination of the 1st
    group verbs.

    - 1st person singular : -e

    

    - 2nd person singular : -es

    

    - 3rd person singular : -e

    

    - 1st person plural : -ons

    

    - 2nd person plural : -ez

    

    - 3rd person plural : -ent

    



    You should be able to conjugate any other 1st group verb. Let’s try ” aller ” :
    j’alle, tu alles, etc. Unfortunately, it’s wrong ! ! ” Aller ” is one of the so many
    irregular verbs. The conjugation is rather :

    - je vais [vÃ©]

    

    - tu vas [va]

    

    - il/elle va

    

    - nous allons

    

    - vous allez

    

    - ils/elles vont [von]

    



Now you can figure out why people are used to saying that the French language is difficult !

Conjugation of the 2nd group verbs



    finir (to finish)

    - je finis

    

    - tu finis]

    

    - il/elle finit

    

    - nous finissons

    

    - vous finissez

    

    - ils/elles finissent

    



    venir (to come)

    - je viens

    

    - tu viens

    

    - il/elle vient

    

    - nous venons

    

    - vous venez

    

    - ils/elles viennent

    



    vouloir (to want)

    - je veux

    

    - tu veux

    

    - il/elle veut

    

    - nous voulons

    

    - vous voulez

    

    - ils/elles veulent

    



Once again, the conjugation of 2nd group verbs respect some kind of termination pattern,
however, less obvious than in the 1st group. Some of the 2nd group verbs conjugate like ”
finir ” (termination pattern : -s, -s, -t, -ssons, -ssez, -ssent) and otherslike ” venir
” (termination pattern : -s, -s, -t, -ons, -ez, -ent). The case of ” vouloir ” is special
for it is an irregular verb. There is no means to find out easily which pattern apply to a given
2nd group verb, excepting learning it by heart.

Conjugation of the 3rd group verbs



    boire (to drink)

    - je bois

    

    - tu bois

    

    - il/elle boit

    

    - nous buvons

    

    - vous buvez

    

    - ils/elles boivent

    



    vendre (to sell)

    - je vends

    

    - tu vends

    

    - il/elle vend

    

    - nous vendons

    

    - vous vendez

    

    - ils/elles vendent

    



    vivre (to live)

    - je vis

    

    - tu vis

    

    - il/elle vit

    

    - nous vivons

    

    - vous vivez

    

    - ils/elles vivent

    



The 3rd group is a real mess since most of the verbs which belong to it are irregular.
Nevertheless, they respect a termination pattern (-s, -s, -t, -ons, -ez, -ent) but are
altered. Once again, no general rule can be drew up. I hope you have a good memory !

” Ãªtre ” (to be) and ” avoir ” (to have)



As in many european languages, ” Ãªtre ” (to be) and ” avoir ” (to have) play a special
role in French. They are also referred to as auxilliaries. French language makes use of only
two auxiliary verbs (Ãªtre and avoir) while English has many of them (to have, will, would,
shall, should, can, could, must, might, ought to, etc.). On one hand, ” Ãªtre ” and ”
avoir ” are strongly irregular but in the other hand, they are used very often.
Consequently, their conjugation must be well known. In the present tense their conjugation
are :

    Ãªtre (to be)

    - je suis [sÃŒi]

    

    - tu es [Ã©]

    

    - il/elle est [Ã©]

    

    - nous sommes [some]

    

    - vous Ãªtes [Ãšt']

    

    - ils/elles sont [son]

    



    avoir (to have)

    - j’ai [jÃš]

    

    - tu as [a]

    

    - il/elle a

    

    - nous avons

    

    - vous avez

    

    - ils/elles ont [on]

    



Despite the irregular behaviour of these verbs, the conjugation terminations respect, more
or less, the pattern we previuosly noticed. Note that this remark is applicable to the verb ”
aller ” as well.

 

Some colours

    

    - bleu (blue)

    

    - rouge (red)

    

    - blanc (white)

    

    - noir (black)

    

    - vert (green)

    

    - jaune (yellow)

    

    - rose (rose)

    

    - orange (orange)

    

    - gris (grey)

    

    - marron/brun (brown)

    



This third leson is tough but it is worth learning it because verbs are a major component in
sentences. So, don’t give up now!

Lesson 4 – Adjectives and Plural



1. Adjectives



In the second lesson we saw that in French nouns have a gender : they can be either masculine or
feminine. Some of them can be both and the feminine form is derived from the masculine by
appending a ” e “. We also learned how the plural affects the nouns, i.e. by appending a ” s
“, in most of the times. To sum up, we can say that the gender and the number (singular or
plural) affect the nouns termination, by appending either a ” e ” or a ” s ” (or
sometimes something more complex).

There is an other kind of words in French which change in accordance to the gender and the number
: the adjectives. Adjectives change according to the gender and the number of the noun which
they qualify. The rules which we drew up for the nouns are applicable to the adjectives :

Adjectives Concordance Rules

    

    - Rule 1 - Concordance with the gender When the noun which an adjective qualifies is
    feminine, an ” e ” is appended to the adjective, if it does not already end with an ” e
    “.

    

    - Rule 2 – Concordance with the number When an adjective refers to a noun in the plurial
    form or more than 1 noun, a ” s ” is appended to it, if it does not end with a ” s “, a” z
    ” or a ” x “.

    

    - Rule 3 - The rules 1 and 2 are cumulative, i.e. if an adjective qualifies a feminine and
    plurial noun, it takes an ” e ” and a ” s ” at the end.

    

    - Rule 4 - Masculine is stronger ! When an adjective refers to a group of masculine and
    feminine nouns, only the masculine concordance rule applies. This rule is also known as
    ” the masculine wins over the feminine “, which is the more macho French grammar rule !

    



Note : In most cases, the adjectives follow the noun or the group of nouns they refer. However,
this remark is not rigid and you can actually put an adjective before the noun it qualifies but
be careful, by doing this, you may change the meaning ! (idiomatic form).

    Examples :

    - un homme petit (a small man) / un petit homme (a kid)

    

    - une femme bonne (a good woman) / une bonne femme (a woman with a pejorative meaning)

    

    - une voiture sale (a dirty car) / une sale voiture (a awful car)

    



Some adjectives are placed before the noun they qualify rather than after.

    Examples :

    - grand (big, large) : we say ” une grande voiture ” (a big car) rather than ” une
    voiture grande “

    

    - beau (nice) : we say ” un beau graÃ§on ” (a nice boy) rather than ” un graÃ§on
    beau “

    



Note that, in these examples, both forms are grammatically correct but French speaking
people prefer the first one.

Examples of adjective concordance rules



Original sentence : Il conduit un camion bleu (He drives a blue truck).

    Let’s apply the fourth rules we mentioned above :

    - Rule 1 – concordance with the gender : Il conduit une voiture bleue

    

    - Rule 2 – concordance with the number : Il conduit des camions bleus

    

    - Rule 3 – accumulation of rules 1 and 2 : Il conduit des voitures bleues

    

    - Rule 4 – ” masculine wins over feminine ” : Il conduit un camion et une voiture bleus

    - dirty

    

    

        masculine singular : sale

    

        feminine singular : sale

    

        masculine plural: sales

    

        feminine plural: sales

    

    

    - long

    

    

        masculine singular : long

    

        feminine singular : longue

    

        masculine plural: longs

    

        feminine plural: longues

    

    

    - short

    

    

        masculine singular : court

    

        feminine singular : courte

    

        masculine plural: courts

    

        feminine plural: courtes

    



    From this list, you can derive the following additional concordance rules which apply
    most of the time :

    1 - when the masculine singular form of the adjectif ends with a e , the feminine form is
    identical to the masculine one (e.g. sale / sale)

    

    2 - when the masculine singular form of the adjectif ends with a n , the feminine form is
    derived by appending a e and by doubling the ending n (e.g. bon / bonne)

    

    3 - when the masculine singular form of the adjectif ends with a er , the feminine form end by
    Ãšre (e.g. lÃ©ger / lÃ©gÃšre)

    

    4 - when the masculine singular form of the adjectif ends with a eau or au , the plural form is
    composed by appending a x and the feminine form is built by replacing eau or au by elle (e.g.
    beau / belle / beaux)

    



3. Our first sentences



    Very simple sentences can be built using a subject, an adjective and the verb Ãªtre (to
    be) such as :

    - La maison est grand e (The house is big).

    

    - La voiture bleu e est chÃšre (The blue car is expensive).

    

    - Tu es grand (You are tall).

    

    - Elle est belle (She is nice).

    

    - Les garÃ§ons et les filles sont grand s (The boys and the girls are tall) – Note that in
    this example the “macho” rule applies because the adjective grand is only in
    concordance with the noun garÃ§ons .

    

    - Nous sommes intelligent s (We are smart).

    



Note that the concordance rules apply to the adjective according to the gender and the number
of the subject. I advise you to buid such sentences using the few words you have already learnt.
It’s a good exercise which make you practice the feminine and plurial forms of the
adjectives as well as the present tense conjugation of the verb Ãªtre. Have a good time.

Lesson 5 – Sentences Structures



Now, it’s time to build sentences. Stand alone words are rarely useful. To express an idea,
whether complex or not, you need to combine words in order to build up sentences. French
language distinguishes three basic sentence structures : normal sentence structure,
negative sentence structure and interrogative sentence structure.

    A typical French sentence is composed of the following elements :

    - The people who or the thing which does the action : it is referred to as the subject of the
    sentence.

    

    - the action : this is the verb .

    

    - the people who or the object which is affected by the action : this element is usually
    called the accusative or complÃ©ment d’objet direct in French grammar. We’re
    going to adopt the term accusative (abbreviation : ACC).

    

    - the circumtances under which the action takes place (the time, the location, etc.) :
    this element is known as the complÃ©ment circonstanciel in French. We’re going to
    call it circumstances (abbreviation : CIR)

    



These elements play the role of elementary bricks that compose a sentence. French, as
English, is a positional language, i.e. the function played by words in the sentence depends
on their position in the sentence. So, each kind of sentence is built according to a specific
structure or framework.

These structures are very useful because they indicate the postition of the various elements
(various bricks) in a given kind of sentence (normal, negative or interrogative). In the
context of spoken language they work pretty well. Written language is often more
sophisticated than spoken language and leads to more complicated sentences. Before
reviewing the various sentences structures in the present tense, let’s introduce some
prepositions

1. Some Prepositions

    

    - dans (in)

    

    - Ã  (to, at)

    

    - de (from)

    

    - sur (on)

    



    Examples :

        Je vis dans une grande ville (I live in a big city).

    

        Les enfants vont Ã  l’Ã©cole (The children are going to school).

    

        Il vient de France (He comes from France).

    

        Nous marchons sur la route (We are walking on the road).

    



2. Normal Sentences



The basic framework of a nomral sentence is :

SUBJECT + VERB + ACC + CIR

This structure is comparable to the English one. Examples : subject verb ACC CIR meaning Tu
chantes une chanson dans la rue You sing a song in the street Il conduit la voiture tous les jours
He drives the car every day Le boulanger vend le pain dans la boulangerie The baker sells bread
in the bakery

3. Negative Sentences



The basic framework of a negative sentence is :

SUBJECT + ne + VERB + pas + ACC + CIR The words ne … pas play a role similar to do not in English.
While do not is located before the verb, in French the verb is put inbetween ne and pas .
Excepting this difference, the structure of a French negative sentence is similar to its
English counterpart.

    Examples :

    - Tu ne chantes pas une chanson dans la rue.

    

    - Il ne conduit pas la voiture tous les jours.

    

    - Le boulanger ne vend pas de pain dans la boulangerie.

    

subject verb ACC CIR meaning Tu ne chantes pas une chanson dans la rue You do not sing a song in the
street Il ne conduit pas la voiture tous les jours He does not drive the car every day Le
boulanger ne vend pas le pain dans la boulangerie The baker does not sell bread in the bakery

4. Interrogative Sentences



    The primary goal of interrogative sentences is to ask questions !! That’s what we call
    in French a “la palissade” or “un truisme” (something obvious). When asking a
    question, you may want to know who ( qui in French) or what ( que in French) is performing the
    action, when ( quand in French) the action is performed, how ( comment in French) or where (
    oÃ¹ in French) it is performed, etc. Most of questions need an interrogative
    conjunction which indicate what we want to know. The basic interrogative conjunctions
    are :

    - qui (who)

    

    - que (what)

    

    - pourquoi (why)

    

    - comment (how)

    

    - quand (when)

    

    - oÃ¹ (where)

    

    - combien (how many, how much)

    



Compared to the normal and negative structures, the interrogative sentences are a little bit
more complicated. Basically, French language provides two interrogative structures : a
spoken laguage oriented structure and a written language oriented one. As the spoken
language is always simpler than the written one, the first structure is easier to understand.
So, let’s start with it.

The basic structure is :

Interrogative conjunction + est-ce que + SUBJECT + VERB + ACC + CIR + ?

Once again, the group of words est-ce que plays a role similar to do in the English
interrogative sentences. As we see, the structure of a French interrogative sentence is
similar to its English couterpart. Note that the interrogative conjunction is optional
depending on what you want to know.

    Examples :

        Question : Est-ce que tu chantes une chanson dans la rue ? (Do you sing a song in the
        street ?

    

        Answer : oui (yes) or non (no)

    

        Question : Qu’est-ce que tu chantes dans la rue ? (What do you sing in the street ?)

    

        Answer : Je chante une chanson. (I sing a song)

    

        Question : Est-ce qu’il conduit la voiture tous les jours ? (Does he drive the car
        every day ?)

    

        Answer : Oui, il condui la voiture tous les jours. (Yes, he drives the car every day)

    

        Question : Quand est-ce qu’il conduit la voiture ? (When does he drive the car ?)

    

        Answer : Il conduit la voiture tous les jours. (He drives the car every day)

    

        Question : Est-ce que le boulanger vend le pain dans la boulangerie ? (Does the baker
        sell the bread in the bakery ?)

    

        Answer : oui (yes) or non (no)

    

        Question : Qui est-ce qui vend le pain dans la boulangerie ? (Who sells the bread in the
        bakery ?)

    

        Answer : Le boulanger. (The baker).

    

        Question : Combien as-tu de frÃšres ? (How many brothers do you have ?)

    

        Answer : J’ai deux frÃšres (I have two brothers) or simply : Deux (two).

    



    Notes :

    1 - when que is followed by a word starting with a vowel, que is contracted in qu’ . This
    rule is illustrated in the examples Qu’est-ce qu’il and Est-ce qu’il and is
    general. We have already mentioned the same kind of contraction with the pronoun je (I) :
    je mange (I eat) and j’achÃšte (I buy).

    

    2 - when used with the conjunction qui (who) , est-ce que is replaced by est-ce qui
    resulting in Qui est-ce qui . This alteration is not a caprice of the French language but is
    conversely governed by strict grammatical rules. The que and the qui we are talking about
    here belong to the pronouns category, as we are going to see later in this course.

    

    3 - Est-ce que does not depend on the gender nor the number of the subject while the English
    do must respect the conjugation pattern of to do. For the fisrt time, French is simpler
    than English !

    

    4 - in French, when you answer a question by only oui (yes) or non (no) you are not required to
    repeat the subject and the verb as in English (yes I do, no we don’t, yes she does, etc.).
    However, it is not grammatically incorrect to repeat the subject. You may want to do that
    in order to emphasize your answer. If you do so, you have to repeat all the words of the
    question Examples : Oui, je chante une chanson ( Yes, I do sing a song). Non, il ne conduit
    pas la voiture tous les jours ( No, he does not drive the car every day)

    



Now, we can introduce the second interrogative structure. Basically, this strcuture
consists of switching the position of the subject and the verb like this :

Interrogative conjunction + VERB + – + SUBJECT + ACC + CIR + ?

Again, the interrogative conjunction is not mandatory. Examples : Questions Answers
Chantes-tu une chanson dans la rue ? oui or non OÃ¹ chantes-tu une chanson ? Dans la rue Que
chantes-tu dans la rue ? Une chanson Conduit-il la voiture tous les jours ? oui or non Que
conduit-il tous les jours ? La voiture Quand conduit-il la voiture ? Tous les jours

It is very easy. However, the pattern only applies when the subject is a pronoun (je, tu,
il/elle, nous, vous, ils/elles). Otherwise, it is not so straight forward. When the subject
is not a pronoun, the interrogative structucture is :

Interrogative conjunction + SUBJECT + VERB+ – + PRONOUN + ACC + CIR + ?

The pronoun which is added must be in accordance to the number and the number of the subject.

Examples :

Normal sentence : Le Boulanger vend le pain dans la boulangerie.

Interrogative sentences

1. Le boulanger vend-il le pain la boulangerie ?

2. OÃ¹ le boulanger vend-il le pain ?

3. Que le boulanger vend-il ?

Explanations : “Le boulanger” is masculine singular The corresponding pronoun is
“il”

Normal sentence : La boulangÃšre vend le pain dans la boulangerie.

Interrogative sentences :

1. La boulangÃšre vend-elle le pain dans la boulangerie ?

2. OÃ¹ la boulangÃšre vend-elle le pain ?

3. Que la boulangÃšre vend-elle ?

Explanations : “La boulangÃšre” is feminine and singular. The corresponding pronoun
is “elle”

Normal sentence : Les boulangÃšres vendent le pain dans la boulangerie.

Interrogative sentences :

1. Les boulangÃšres vendent-elles le pain dans la boulangerie ?

2. OÃ¹ les boulangÃšres vendent-ellesle pain ?

3. Que les boulangÃšres vendent-elles ?

Explanaitons : “Les boulangÃšres” is feminine and plural. The corresponding pronoun
is “elles”

Normal sentence : Le boulanger et la boulangÃšre vendent le pain dans la boulangerie.

Interrogative sentences :

1. Le boulanger et la boulangÃšre vendent-ils le pain dans la boulangerie ?

2. OÃ¹ le boulanger et la boulangÃšre vendent-ils le pain ?

3. Que le boulanger et la boulangÃšre vendent-ils ?

Explanations : “Le boulanger et la boulangÃšre” is a subject which comprises two
people, therefore it is plural. As far as the gender is concerned, you have to remember the
macho rule ” the masculine wins over the feminine “. Consequently the gender of this
subject is masculine. The corresponding pronoun is then “ils”

This fifth lesson ends the grammatical core of the course. In the next lessons, we’re going
to focus on the vocabulary and the language by itself i.e. usual expressions, familiar
expressions and idiomatic expressions. Other major verb tenses (past, future and
conditonal) will be introduce at a steady pace. So don’t miss the next lessons.

PERKENALAN

Tidak seperti umumnya bahasa-bahasa lain didunia, kalimat untuk menanyakan nama dalam
Bahasa Rusia tidak menggunakan formasi kata â€œSiapa namamu?â€™, melainkan
dengan susunan kata â€œ Bagaimana anda dipanggil? â€�. Untuk memudahkan proses
penerjemahan, formasi kata ini, yang juga dapat ditemukan dalam Bahasa Mandarin,
diterjemahkan menjadi â€œ Siapa namamu? â€�.

Alfabet Bahasa Rusia



source: http://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahasa_Rusia

Bahasa Rusia ditulis menggunakanÂ  alfabet Sirilik
Â (ÐºÐžÑ€ÐžÐ»Ð»ÐžÑ†Ð°,Â  kirillitsa ), yaitu alfabet yang
ditemukan olehÂ  St. Cyril Â danÂ  Methodius , keduanya adalahÂ  misionaris Â 
Kristen Â dariÂ  Yunani Â pada abad IX yang menerjemahkan kitab-kitab agamaÂ 
Kristen Ortodoks Â ke dalamÂ  bahasa Slavia Kuno . Saat ini, alfabet Sirilik yang
dipakai di Rusia telah dimodifikasi sedemikian rupa dan terdiri atas sebelasÂ  huruf
vokal , dua puluhÂ  konsonan , serta dua penanda keras dan lunak sehingga seluruhnya ada 33
huruf.

Banyaknya bunyi huruf dalam bahasa Rusia menjadikan bahasa ini terdengar melodis. Di
sinilah keunikan bahasa Rusia bila dibandingkan dengan bahasa-bahasa lainnya. Huruf Nama

source: http://mieee.wordpress.com/bahasa-rusia/ B. ATURAN PENGEJAAN I. Huruf vokal
Ð�Ð° diucapkan a biasa, seperti pada bahasa Indonesia. Ð•Ðµ diucapkan seperti ye
pada kata bahasa Indonesia â€˜yel yelâ€™, apabila tidak mendapatkan tekanan,
maka akan diucapkan lemah (menjadi bunyi yeu atau i). Ð�Ñ‘ diucapkan seperti yo pada
kata bahasa Indonesia â€˜yoyoâ€™. Selalu mendapat tekanan Ð˜Ðž diucapkan i
biasa, serupa dengan i bahasa Indonesia. Ð™Ð¹ diucapkan y seperti pada kata amboy, mey,
dsb. Didalam kata, huruf ini hanya ditemui dibelakang huruf vokal, karena huruf ini
berfungsi sebagai diftong. ÐžÐŸ diucapkan seperti ÐŸ pada bahasa Indonesia umumnya,
apabila tidak mendapatkan tekanan, akan diucapkan eu (seperti e pada kata
â€˜sepertiâ€™), contoh: ÐœÐµÑ€ÑƒÑˆÐžÐŒÐŸÐ¹ diucapkan
nyeurushimeuy, Ð¿Ñ€ÐŸÑ‡ÐœÐŸÐ¹ diucapkan prochneuy. Dibeberapakata
diucapkan Ð°. Contoh: Ð¥ÐŸÑ€ÐŸÑˆÐŸ diucapkan heurasho. Ð£Ñƒ
diucapkan u seperti pada bahasa Indonesia. Ñ‹ ketika dieja, huruf ini diucapkan eu
(seperti e pada kata â€˜sepertiâ€™) namun di dalam kata, ia diucapkan i dengan
lidah ditarik ke belakang. Didalam kata, huruf ini hanya dapat ditemui dibelakang huruf
konsonan. Ð­Ñ� diucapkan e seperti pada bahasa Indonesia, nenek, pesek. dsb. Hanya
ditemui dalam kata kata serapan. Ð®ÑŽ diucapkan yu, seperti pada kata
â€˜ayuâ€™. Ð¯Ñ� diucapkan ya, seperti pada kata ‘saya’ II. Huruf
Konsonan Ð‘Ð± diucapkan sama seperti b dalam bahasa Indonesia. Ð’Ð² diucapkan
dengan gigi bagian atas menempel di â€˜dasarâ€™ bibir bagian bawah, sehingga
terdengar 2 huruf sekaligus (v dan w). Ð“Ð³ diucapkan sama seperti g dalam bahasa
Indonesia. Ð”ÐŽ diucapkan sama seperti d dalam bahasa Indonesia. Ð–Ð¶ diucapkan
seperti s dalam kata bahasa Inggris â€˜measureâ€™, â€˜pleasureâ€™.
Ð—Ð· diucapkan sama seperti z dalam bahasa Indonesia. ÐšÐº diucapkan sama seperti
k dalam bahasa Indonesia. Ð›Ð» diucapkan sama seperti l dalam bahasa Indonesia.
ÐœÐŒ diucapkan sama seperti m dalam bahasa Indonesia. Ð�Ðœ diucapkan sama seperti
n dalam bahasa Indonesia. ÐŸÐ¿ diucapkan sama seperti p dalam bahasa Indonesia.
Ð Ñ€ diucapkan sama seperti r dalam bahasa Indonesia. Ð¡Ñ� diucapkan sama
seperti s dalam bahasa Indonesia. Ð¢Ñ‚ diucapkan sama seperti t dalam bahasa
Indonesia. Ð€Ñ„ diucapkan sama seperti f dalam bahasa Indonesia. Ð¥Ñ…
diucapkan seperti kh dalam bahasa Indonesia â€˜akhirâ€™, atau dalam bahasa Arab,
kita mengenal huruf ïº¥ ÐŠÑ† diucapkan seperti th dalam bahasa Inggris
â€˜thinâ€™, dalam bahasa Arab, kita mengenal huruf Ø« Ð§Ñ‡ diucapkan sama
seperti c dalam bahasa Indonesia. ÐšÑˆ diucapkan seperti sh dalam bahasa Inggris
â€˜shut upâ€™ Ð©Ñ‰ diucapkan seperti sy, dalam kata
â€˜syaratâ€™. atau dalam bahasa Arab, kita mengenal huruf ØŽ II. Tanda lunak &
Tanda keras ÑŠ tidak ada bunyinya, didalam huruf hanya berguna sebagai penebal bunyi huruf
didepannya. Dalam bahasa Arab kita mengenal qalqalah. ÑŒ tidak ada bunyinya, didalam
huruf hanya berguna sebagai pelembut bunyi konsonan didepannya. Catatan: Di dalam bahasa
Rusia huruf Ñ‘ (yo) dianggap sebagai pergeseran bunyi dari Ðµ, oleh karena itu didalam
majalah, artikel-artikel dan harian-harian umum di Rusia, huruf Â Ñ‘ (yo) dan huruf
Ðµ (ye) keduanya ditulis dengan Ðµ (ye). Huruf Ñ‘ (yo); -dengan titik dua- dewasa ini
hanya digunakan pada kamus, buku-buku anak-anak, dan buku-buku pelajaran bahasa Rusia Oleh
karena sangat penting bagi anda untuk menghafalkan kata-kata Rusia yang menggunakan huruf
Ñ‘ (yo) agar tidak terjadi kesalahan ucapan (huruf Ðµ yang seharusnya dibaca yo, dibaca
ye). Kalau sepatah kata terdiri dari dua suku atau lebih, salah satu dari suku katanya
diucapkan lebih tegas, yaitu: suku kata yang diberi aksen atau tekanan suara, sedangkan
suku-suku yang lain tidak. Pada kata Ð€Ñ€ Ð° Ð·Ð° – kalimat misalnya, suku
kata yang pertama diberi tekanan sedangkan pada kata Ñ€Ð°Ð± ÐŸ Ñ‚Ð° â€“
pekerjaan, tekanan terletak pada suku kata yang kedua. Waktu menghafal suatu kosa kata
bahasa Rusia, ingat-ingatlah suku katanya yang mana yang diberi tekanan kalau kita salah
memberi tekanan, artinya mungkin berubah. misalnya kalau pada kata ÐŽ ÐŸ ÐŒÐ°
tekanan terletak di suku pertama, kata ÐŽ ÐŸ ÐŒÐ° artinya
â€œdirumahâ€™â€™, sedangkan kalau tekanan diletakkan pada suku kata kedua
(ÐŽÐŸÐŒ Ð° ), kata itu berarti â€œrumah-rumahâ€�. Untuk memudahkan
pelajaran, kosa kata Rusia yang mendapat tekanan suara akan beri aksen/garis bawah. Hal ini
biasa dipakai dalam kamus-kamus bahasa Rusia dengan maksud yang sama. Dalam buku-buku
bahasa Rusia yang lain, dalam majalah-majalah dan harian-harian letak aksen tidak
ditandai.

Mengenal penyebutan angka dgn menggunakan bahasa rusia

Sebelumnya saya sudahÂ  memosting ttg alfabet dan percakapan singkat bahasa rusia. Kali
ini saya ingin memosting gmna penyebutan dgn menggunakan bahasaÂ  rusia. Penting uga kita
mengetahui seperti apa saja bilangan dari 1 sampai 10 bagi yg memenag ingin bljr at
memperdalam bhasa rusia. Seprti juga bahasa indonesia, bahasa rusia pun memiliki
perubahan2 penyebutan. Contoh singkatnya saya ambil dari bhs indonesia. Bila kita menyebut
misal angka 1 maka kita menyebutnya angka satu, bila berubah menjadi tingkatan maka kita
menyebutnya kesatu atau pertama. Bahasa rusia pun seperti itu. Tapi di sini saya tidak akan
panjang lebar menjelaskannya soalnya saya pun kesulitan jika menjelaskannya secara
tulisa, dan bagi yg baca pun akan jadi bingung.

Klo gitu langsung aj ya kita bahasÂ

1000 (tisic)

Nah klo sebelumnya saya sudah memberi contoh bagaimana cara menyebutkan angka 1 s/d 1000,
sekarang saya akan memberi contoh sedikit ttg penyebutan tingkat. Lagi2 saya tidak akan
terlalu dalam menjelaskannya tapi ya setidak2nya bisa menjadi gambaran sedikit lah.
Sebenarnya ini bukan bidang saya sih, maklum bukan anak sastra dan bahasa rusia tapi anak
geologi. Oh ya sebelumnya mau dikasih tau, saya mostingin ini tidak sesuai dengan hurufnya
tapi lebih gimana cara pengucapannya soalnya klo dilihat dari huruf dan cara pengucapannya
sedikit berbeda.

Ok next lanjut ke yg lainâ€Š..

History of Math(From Prehistoric to Modern)

Posted on September 22, 2011 by Ahyasassin





Prehistoric mathematics



Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Ishango_bone.jpg/400px-Ishango_bone.jpg
source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mathematics TheÂ  Ishango bone ,
dating to perhaps 18,000 to 20,000Â  B.C.

The origins of mathematical thought lie in the concepts ofÂ  number , magnitude , andÂ 
form .Â Modern studies of animal cognition have shown that these concepts are not unique to
humans. Such concepts would have been part of everyday life in hunter-gatherer societies.
The idea of the “number” concept evolving gradually over time is supported by the
existence of languages which preserve the distinction between “one”, “two”, and
“many”, but not of numbers larger than two.

The oldest known possibly mathematical object is theÂ  Lebombo bone , discovered in the
Lebombo mountains ofÂ  Swaziland Â and dated to approximately 35,000 BC.Â It
consists of 29 distinct notches cut into a baboon’s fibula.Â AlsoÂ  prehistoric Â 
artifacts discovered in Africa andÂ  France , dated betweenÂ  35,000 Â andÂ 
20,000 Â years old,Â suggest early attempts toÂ  quantify Â time.

TheÂ  Ishango bone , found near the headwaters of theÂ  Nile Â river
(northeasternÂ  Congo ), may be as much asÂ  20,000 Â years old and consists of a series
of tally marks carved in three columns running the length of the bone. Common interpretations
are that the Ishango bone shows either the earliest known demonstration ofÂ  sequences
Â ofÂ  prime numbers Â or a six month lunar calendar.Â In the bookÂ  How
Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years , Peter Rudman argues that the development of
the concept of prime numbers could only have come about after the concept of division, which he
dates to after 10,000 BC, with prime numbers probably not being understood until about 500 BC.
He also writes that “no attempt has been made to explain why a tally of something should
exhibit multiples of two, prime numbers between 10 and 20, and some numbers that are almost
multiples of 10.”

Predynastic Egyptians Â of the 5th millennium BC pictorially representedÂ  geometric
Â designs. It has been claimed thatÂ  megalithic Â monuments in England Â andÂ 
Scotland , dating from the 3rd millennium BC, incorporate geometric ideas such asÂ 
circles ,Â  ellipses , andÂ  Pythagorean triples Â in their design.

Mesopotamian mathematics

The Babylonian mathematical tablet Plimpton 322, dated to 1800 BC.

Babylonian Â mathematics refers to any mathematics of the people ofÂ  Mesopotamia
Â (modern Iraq ) from the days of the earlyÂ  Sumerians Â through theÂ  Hellenistic
period Â almost to the dawn ofÂ  Christianity .Â It is named Babylonian mathematics
due to the central role ofÂ  Babylon Â as a place of study. Later under theÂ  Arab Empire
, Mesopotamia, especiallyÂ  Baghdad , once again became an important center of study
forÂ  Islamic mathematics .

In contrast to the sparsity of sources inÂ  Egyptian mathematics , our knowledge of
Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the
1850s.Written inÂ  Cuneiform script , tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist,
and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework.

The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancientÂ  Sumerians , who
built the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia. They developed a complex system ofÂ 
metrology Â from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wroteÂ 
multiplication tables Â on clay tablets and dealt withÂ  geometrical Â exercises
andÂ  division Â problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date
back to this period.

The majority of recovered clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics which
include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation ofÂ 
regular Â  reciprocal Â  pairs .Â The tablets also include multiplication tables and
methods for solvingÂ  linear Â and quadratic equations . The Babylonian tablet YBC 7289
gives an approximation to âˆš2 accurate to five decimal places.

Babylonian mathematics were written using aÂ  sexagesimal Â (base-60)Â  numeral
system . From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour,
and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote
fractions of a degree. Babylonian advances in mathematics were facilitated by the fact that
60 has many divisors. Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a
true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values,
much as in theÂ  decimal Â system. They lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal
point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.

Egyptian mathematics

Image of Problem 14 from theÂ  Moscow Mathematical Papyrus . The problem includes a diagram
indicating the dimensions of the truncated pyramid.

Egyptian Â mathematics refers to mathematics written in theÂ  Egyptian language . From
theÂ  Hellenistic period ,Â  Greek Â replaced Egyptian as the written language
ofÂ  Egyptian scholars. Mathematical study inÂ  Egypt Â later continued under
theÂ  Arab Empire Â as part ofÂ  Islamic mathematics , whenÂ  Arabic Â became the
written language of Egyptian scholars.

The most extensive Egyptian mathematical text is theÂ  Rhind papyrus Â (sometimes also
called the Ahmes Papyrus after its author), dated to c. 1650 BC but likely a copy of an older
document from theÂ  Middle Kingdom Â of about 2000-1800 BC.Â It is an instruction
manual for students in arithmetic and geometry. In addition to giving area formulas and
methods for multiplication, division and working with unit fractions, it also contains
evidence of other mathematical knowledge,Â includingÂ  composite andÂ  prime
numbers ;Â  arithmetic ,Â  geometric Â andÂ  harmonic means ; and simplistic
understandings of both theÂ  Sieve of Eratosthenes Â andÂ  perfect number theory
Â (namely, that of the number 6).Â It also shows how to solve first orderÂ  linear
equations Â  as well asÂ  arithmetic Â andÂ  geometric series .

Another significant Egyptian mathematical text is theÂ  Moscow papyrus , also from
theÂ  Middle Kingdom Â period, dated to c. 1890 BC.Â It consists of what are today
calledÂ  word problems Â orÂ  story problems , which were apparently intended as
entertainment. One problem is considered to be of particular importance because it gives a
method for finding the volume of aÂ  frustum : “If you are told: A truncated pyramid of 6 for
the vertical height by 4 on the base by 2 on the top. You are to square this 4, result 16. You are to
double 4, result 8. You are to square 2, result 4. You are to add the 16, the 8, and the 4, result 28.
You are to take one third of 6, result 2. You are to take 28 twice, result 56. See, it is 56. You will
find it right.”

Finally, theÂ  Berlin papyrus Â (c. 1300 BC) shows that ancient Egyptians could solve a
second-orderÂ  algebraic equation .

Greek Mathematics



Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Pythagorean.svg/200px-Pythagorean.svg.png
TheÂ  Pythagorean theorem . The Pythagoreans Â are generally credited with the first
proof of the theorem.

Greek mathematics refers to the mathematics written in theÂ  Greek language Â from the
time ofÂ  Thales of Miletus Â (~600 BC) to the closure of theÂ  Academy of Athens Â in
529 AD.Â Greek mathematicians lived in cities spread over the entire Eastern
Mediterranean, from Italy to North Africa, but were united by culture and language. Greek
mathematics of the period followingÂ  Alexander the Great Â is sometimes called
Hellenistic mathematics.

Greek mathematics was much more sophisticated than the mathematics that had been developed
by earlier cultures. All surviving records of pre-Greek mathematics show the use of
inductive reasoning, that is, repeated observations used to establish rules of thumb. Greek
mathematicians, by contrast, used deductive reasoning. The Greeks used logic to derive
conclusions from definitions and axioms, and usedÂ  mathematical rigor Â toÂ  prove
Â them.

Greek mathematics is thought to have begun withÂ  Thales of Miletus Â (c.
624â€“c.546 BC) and Pythagoras of Samos Â (c. 582â€“c. 507 BC). Although the
extent of the influence is disputed, they were probably inspired byÂ  Egyptian
Â andÂ  Babylonian mathematics . According to legend, Pythagoras traveled to Egypt to
learn mathematics, geometry, and astronomy from Egyptian priests.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Archimedes_pi.svg/220px-Archimedes_pi.svg.png
Archimedes used theÂ  method of exhaustion Â to approximate the value ofÂ  pi .

Thales usedÂ  geometry Â to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids
and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive
reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries toÂ  Thales’ Theorem . As a
result, he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to
whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.Â Pythagoras established theÂ 
Pythagorean School , whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose
motto was “All is number”.Â It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term
“mathematics”, and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins. The
Pythagoreans are credited with the first proof of theÂ  Pythagorean theorem ,Â though
the statement of the theorem has a long history, and with the proof of the existence ofÂ 
irrational numbers .

One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid’sÂ  Elements , found atÂ  Oxyrhynchus
and dated to circa AD 100. The diagram accompanies Book II, Proposition 5.

Plato Â (428/427 BC â€“ 348/347 BC) is important in the history of mathematics for
inspiring and guiding others.HisÂ  Platonic Academy , inÂ  Athens , became the
mathematical center of the world in the 4th century BC, and it was from this school that the
leading mathematicians of the day, such asÂ  Eudoxus of Cnidus , came from.Â Plato also
discussed the foundations of mathematics, clarified some of the definitions (e.g. that of a
line as “breadthless length”), and reorganized the assumptions.TheÂ  analytic
method Â is ascribed to Plato, while a formula for obtaining Pythagorean triples bears his
name.

Eudoxus Â (408â€“c.355 BC) developed theÂ  method of exhaustion , a precursor of
modern integration Â and a theory of ratios that avoided the problem ofÂ 
incommensurable magnitudes .The former allowed the calculations of areas and volumes of
curvilinear figures,Â while the latter enabled subsequent geometers to make
significant advances in geometry. Though he made no specific technical mathematical
discoveries,Â  Aristotle Â (384â€”c.322 BC) contributed significantly to the
development of mathematics by laying the foundations ofÂ  logic .

In the 3rd century BC, the premier center of mathematical education and research was theÂ 
Musaeum Â ofÂ  Alexandria .Â It was there that Euclid Â (c. 300 BC) taught, and
wrote theÂ  Elements , widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of
all time. [1] Â The Elements Â introducedÂ  mathematical rigor Â through theÂ 
axiomatic method Â and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics
today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of
theÂ  Elements Â were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent
logical framework.Â TheÂ  Elements Â was known to all educated people in the West
until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes
today.Â In addition to the familiar theorems ofÂ  Euclidean geometry , the Elements
Â was meant as an introductory textbook to all mathematical subjects of the time, such
asÂ  number theory ,Â  algebra Â andÂ  solid geometry ,Â including proofs that
the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Euclid
alsoÂ  wrote extensively Â on other subjects, such asÂ  conic sections ,Â  optics
,Â  spherical geometry , and mechanics, but only half of his writings survive.

Archimedes Â (c.287â€“212 BC) ofÂ  Syracuse Â used theÂ  method of
exhaustion Â to calculate theÂ  area Â under the arc of aÂ  parabola Â with
theÂ  summation of an infinite series , and gave remarkably accurate approximations
ofÂ  Pi .Â He also studied theÂ  spiral Â bearing his name, formulas for the volumes
Â ofÂ  surfaces of revolution , and an ingenious system for expressing very large
numbers.

Chinese mathematics

Counting rod numerals

The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art , one of the earliest surviving mathematical texts
fromÂ  China (2nd century AD).

Early Chinese mathematics is so different from that of other parts of the world that it is
reasonable to assume independent development.The oldest extant mathematical text from
China is theÂ  Chou Pei Suan Ching , variously dated to between 1200 BC and 100 BC, though a
date of about 300 BC appears reasonable.

Of particular note is the use in Chinese mathematics of a decimal positional notation system,
the so-called “rod numerals” in which distinct ciphers were used for numbers between 1
and 10, and additional ciphers for powers of tenThus, the number 123 would be written using the
symbol for “1″, followed by the symbol for “100″, then the symbol for “2″
followed by the symbol for “10″, followed by the symbol for “3″. This was the most
advanced number system in the world at the time, apparently in use several centuries before
the common era and well before the development of the Indian numeral system.Â Rod numerals
allowed the representation of numbers as large as desired and allowed calculations to be
carried out on the suan pan , or (Chinese abacus). The date of the invention of theÂ  suan pan
Â is not certain, but the earliest written mention dates from AD 190, in Xu Yue’sÂ 
Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures .

The oldest existent work onÂ  geometry Â in China comes from the philosophicalÂ 
Mohist Â canon c. 330 BC, compiled by the followers ofÂ  Mozi Â (470â€“390 BC).
TheÂ  Mo Jing Â described various aspects of many fields associated with physical
science, and provided a small number of geometrical theorems as well.

In 212 BC, the EmperorÂ  Qin Shi Huang Â (Shi Huang-ti) commanded all books in the Qin
Empire other than officially sanctioned ones be burned. This decree was not universally
obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics
before this date. After theÂ  book burning Â of 212 BC, theÂ  Han dynasty Â (202
BCâ€“220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are
now lost. The most important of these isÂ  The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art , the
full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It
consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to
figure height spans and dimension ratios forÂ  Chinese pagoda Â towers, engineering,
surveying , and includes material onÂ  right triangles Â and values ofÂ  Ï€ .It
also made use ofÂ  Cavalieri’s principle Â on volume more than a thousand years before
Cavalieri would propose it in the West.Â It created mathematical proof for theÂ 
Pythagorean theorem , and a mathematical formula forÂ  Gaussian elimination .Â  Liu Hui
Â commented on the work by the 3rd century AD, and gave a value of Ï€ accurate to 5 decimal
places. Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th
century ADÂ  Zu Chongzhi computed the value of Ï€ to seven decimal places, which
remained the most accurate value of Ï€ for almost the next 1000 years.

The high water mark of Chinese mathematics occurs in the 13th century, with the development of
Chinese algebra. The most important text from that period is theÂ  Precious Mirror of the
Four Elements Â by Chu Shih-chieh (fl. 1280-1303), dealing with the solution of
simultaneous higher order algebraic equations using a method similar toÂ  Horner’s
method .Â TheÂ  Precious Mirror Â also contains a diagram ofÂ  Pascal’s
triangle Â with coefficients of binomial expansions through the eighth power, though
both appear in Chinese works as early as 1100.Â The Chinese also made use of the complex
combinatorial diagram known as theÂ  magic square Â andÂ  magic circles , described
in ancient times and perfected byÂ  Yang Hui Â (AD 1238â€“1298).

Even after European mathematics began to flourish during theÂ  Renaissance , European and
Chinese mathematics were separate traditions, with significant Chinese mathematical
output in decline from the 13th century onwards.Â  Jesuit Â missionaries such asÂ 
Matteo Ricci Â carried mathematical ideas back and forth between the two cultures from the
16th to 18th centuries, though at this point far more mathematical ideas were entering China
than leaving.

Brahmi numerals Â (lower row) inÂ  India Â in the 1st century CE

The earliest civilization on the Indian subcontinent is theÂ  Indus Valley Civilization
Â that flourished between 2600 and 1900 BC in theÂ  Indus river basin. Their cities were
laid out with geometric regularity, but no known mathematical documents survive from this
civilization.

The oldest extant mathematical records from India are theÂ  Shatapatha Brahmana Â (c.
9th century BC but estimates of the date vary widely). The Sulba Sutras Â (c. 800
BCâ€“200 AD),Â appendices to religious texts which give simple rules for
constructing altars of various shapes, such as squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and
others.Â The Sulba Sutras give methods for constructing aÂ  circle with approximately
the same area as a given square , which imply several different approximations of the value
ofÂ  Ï€ ,Â In addition, they compute theÂ  square root Â of 2 to several decimal
places, list Pythagorean triples, and give a statement of theÂ  Pythagorean theorem
.Mesopotamian influence at this stage is considered likely.

PÄ�á¹‡ini Â (c. 5th century BC) formulated the rules forÂ  Sanskrit grammar
.Â His notation was similar to modern mathematical notation, and used metarules,Â 
transformations , andÂ  recursion .Â  Pingala Â (roughly 3rd-1st centuries BC) in
his treatise ofÂ  prosody Â uses a device corresponding to aÂ  binary numeral system
.Â His discussion of theÂ  combinatorics Â ofÂ  meters Â corresponds to an
elementary version of theÂ  binomial theorem . [ Pingala's work also contains the basic
ideas ofÂ  Fibonacci numbers Â (calledÂ  mÄ�trÄ�meru ).

TheÂ  Surya Siddhanta Â (c. 400) introduced theÂ  trigonometric functions
Â ofÂ  sine ,Â  cosine , and inverse sine, and laid down rules to determine the true
motions of the luminaries, which conforms to their actual positions in the sky.Â This work
was translated into to Arabic and Latin during the Middle Ages.

In the 5th century AD,Â  Aryabhata Â wrote theÂ  Aryabhatiya , a slim volume, written
in verse, intended to supplement the rules of calculation used in astronomy and mathematical
mensuration, though with no feeling for logic or deductive methodology.Â Though about
half of the entries are wrong, it is in theÂ  Aryabhatiya Â that the decimal place-value
system first appears. Several centuries later, theÂ  Muslim mathematician Â  Abu
Rayhan Biruni Â described theÂ  Aryabhatiya Â as a "mix of common pebbles and costly
crystals".

In the 7th century,Â  Brahmagupta Â identified theÂ  Brahmagupta theorem ,Â 
Brahmagupta's identity Â andÂ  Brahmagupta's formula , and for the first time, inÂ 
Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta , he lucidly explained the use ofÂ  zero Â as both a
placeholder andÂ  decimal digit , and explained theÂ  Hindu-Arabic numeral system
.Â It was from a translation of this Indian text on mathematics (c. 770) that Islamic
mathematicians were introduced to this numeral system, which they adapted asÂ  Arabic
numerals . Islamic scholars carried knowledge of this number system to Europe by the 12th
century, and it has now displaced all older number systems throughout the world. In the 10th
century,Â  Halayudha 's commentary on Pingala 's work contains a study of theÂ 
Fibonacci sequence Â andÂ  Pascal's triangle , and describes the formation of aÂ 
matrix .

In the 12th century,Â  BhÄ�skara II Â lived in southern India and wrote extensively
on all then known branches of mathematic. His work contains mathematical objects equivalent
or approximately equivalent to infinitesimals, derivatives,Â  the mean value theorem
Â and the derivative of the sine function. To what extent he anticipated the invention of
calculus is a controversial subject among historians of mathematics

In the 14th century,Â  Madhava of Sangamagrama , the founder of the so-calledÂ  Kerala
School of Mathematics , found theÂ  Madhavaâ€“Leibniz series , and, using 21 terms,
computed the value of Ï€ as 3.14159265359. Madhava also foundÂ  the Madhava-Gregory
series Â to determine the arctangent, the Madhava-Newton power series to determine sine
and cosine andÂ  the Taylor approximation Â for sine and cosine functions .In the 16th
century,Â  Jyesthadeva Â consolidated many of the Kerala School's developments and
theorems in theÂ  Yukti-bhÄ�á¹£Ä� .Â However, the Kerala School did not
formulate a systematic theory ofÂ  differentiation Â andÂ  integration , nor is
there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.Â Progress
in mathematics along with other fields of science stagnated in India with the establishment
ofÂ  Muslim rule in India .

Page fromÂ  The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing byÂ 
Muhammad ibn MÅ«sÄ� al-KhwÄ�rizmÄ« Â (c.Â AD 820)

TheÂ  Islamic Empire Â established acrossÂ  Persia , theÂ  Middle East ,Â 
Central Asia ,Â  North Africa ,Â  Iberia , and in parts ofÂ  India Â in the 8th century
made significant contributions towards mathematics. Although most Islamic texts on
mathematics were written inÂ  Arabic , most of them were not written byÂ  Arabs , since
much like the status of Greek in the Hellenistic world, Arabic was used as the written language
of non-Arab scholars throughout the Islamic world at the time.Â  Persians contributed to
the world of Mathematics alongside Arabs.

In the 9th century, theÂ  Persian Â mathematicianÂ  Muáž¥ammad ibn MÅ«sÄ�
al-KhwÄ�rizmÄ« Â wrote several important books on the Hindu-Arabic numerals and on
methods for solving equations. His bookÂ  On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals , written
about 825, along with the work ofÂ  Al-Kindi , were instrumental in spreadingÂ  Indian
mathematics Â andÂ  Indian numerals Â to the West. The word algorithm Â is derived
from the Latinization of his name, Algoritmi, and the wordÂ  algebra Â from the title of
one of his works,Â  Al-KitÄ�b al-mukhtaá¹£ar fÄ« hÄ«sÄ�b al-ÄŸabr
waâ€™l-muqÄ�bala Â ( The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and
Balancing ). He gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic
equations with positive roots,and he was the first to teach algebra in an elementary form
Â and for its own sake.Â He also discussed the fundamental method of " reduction " and
"balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an
equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is
the operation which al-KhwÄ�rizmÄ« originally described asÂ  al-jabr .His algebra
was also no longer concerned "with a series ofÂ  problems Â to be resolved, but anÂ 
exposition Â which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all
possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true
object of study." He also studied an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar
as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to
define an infinite class of problems."

Further developments in algebra were made byÂ  Al-Karaji Â in his treatiseÂ 
al-Fakhri , where he extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots
of unknown quantities. Something close to aÂ  proof Â byÂ  mathematical induction
Â appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove theÂ 
binomial theorem ,Â  Pascal's triangle , and the sum ofÂ  integral Â  cubes
.Â TheÂ  historian Â of mathematics, F. Woepcke, [86] Â praised Al-Karaji for
being “the first who introduced theÂ  theory Â ofÂ  algebraic Â  calculus .”
Also in the 10th century, Abul Wafa Â translated the works ofÂ  Diophantus Â into
Arabic.Â  Ibn al-Haytham Â was the first mathematician to derive the formula for the sum
of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the
general formula for the sum of any integral powers. He performed an integration in order to
find the volume of aÂ  paraboloid , and was able to generalize his result for the integrals
ofÂ  polynomials Â up to theÂ  fourth degree . He thus came close to finding a general
formula for theÂ  integrals Â of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any
polynomials higher than the fourth degree.

In the late 11th century,Â  Omar Khayyam Â wroteÂ  Discussions of the Difficulties in
Euclid , a book about what he perceived as flaws inÂ  Euclid’s Elements , especially
theÂ  parallel postulate . He was also the first to find the general geometric solution
toÂ  cubic equations . He was also very influential inÂ  calendar reform .

In the 13th century,Â  Nasir al-Din Tusi Â (Nasireddin) made advances inÂ  spherical
trigonometry . He also wrote influential work onÂ  Euclid ‘sÂ  parallel postulate . In
the 15th century,Â  Ghiyath al-Kashi Â computed the value ofÂ  Ï€ Â to the 16th
decimal place. Kashi also had an algorithm for calculatingÂ  n th roots, which was a special
case of the methods given many centuries later byÂ  Ruffini Â andÂ  Horner .

Other achievements of Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of
theÂ  decimal point Â notation to theÂ  Arabic numerals , the discovery of all the
modernÂ  trigonometric functions Â besides the sine,Â  al-Kindi ‘s introduction
ofÂ  cryptanalysis Â andÂ  frequency analysis , the development ofÂ  analytic
geometry Â byÂ  Ibn al-Haytham , the beginning ofÂ  algebraic geometry Â byÂ 
Omar Khayyam Â and the development of an algebraic notation Â byÂ 
al-QalasÄ�dÄ« .

During the time of theÂ  Ottoman Empire Â andÂ  Safavid Empire Â from the 15th
century, the development of Islamic mathematics became stagnant.

Medieval European mathematics



Medieval European interest in mathematics was driven by concerns quite different from those
of modern mathematicians. One driving element was the belief that mathematics provided the
key to understanding the created order of nature, frequently justified byÂ  Plato
‘sÂ  Timaeus Â and the biblical passage (in theÂ  Book of Wisdom ) that God hadÂ 
ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight .

Boethius Â provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he
coined the termÂ  quadrivium Â to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry,
astronomy, and music. He wroteÂ  De institutione arithmetica , a free translation from the
Greek ofÂ  Nicomachus ‘s Introduction to Arithmetic ;Â  De institutione musica , also
derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts fromÂ  Euclid ‘sÂ  Elements . His
works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study
until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.

In the 12th century, European scholars traveled to Spain and SicilyÂ  seeking scientific
Arabic texts , includingÂ  al-KhwÄ�rizmÄ« ‘sÂ  The Compendious Book on
Calculation by Completion and Balancing , translated into Latin byÂ  Robert of Chester ,
and the complete text ofÂ  Euclid’s Elements , translated in various versions byÂ 
Adelard of Bath ,Â  Herman of Carinthia , andÂ  Gerard of Cremona .

These new sources sparked a renewal of mathematics.Â  Fibonacci , writing in theÂ  Liber
Abaci , in 1202 and updated in 1254, produced the first significant mathematics in Europe
since the time ofÂ  Eratosthenes , a gap of more than a thousand years. The work
introducedÂ  Hindu-Arabic numerals Â to Europe, and discussed many other
mathematical problems.

The 14th century saw the development of new mathematical concepts to investigate a wide range
of problems.Â One important contribution was development of mathematics of local
motion.

Thomas Bradwardine Â proposed that speed (V) increases in arithmetic proportion as the
ratio of force (F) to resistance (R) increases in geometric proportion. Bradwardine
expressed this by a series of specific examples, but although the logarithm had not yet been
conceived, we can express his conclusion anachronistically by writing: V = log
(F/R).Â Bradwardine’s analysis is an example of transferring a mathematical
technique used byÂ  al-Kindi Â andÂ  Arnald of Villanova Â to quantify the nature
of compound medicines to a different physical problem .

One of the 14th-centuryÂ  Oxford Calculators ,Â  William Heytesbury , lackingÂ 
differential calculus Â and the concept ofÂ  limits , proposed to measure
instantaneous speed “by the path thatÂ  would Â be described by [a body]Â  if … it
were moved uniformly at the same degree of speed with which it is moved in that given instant”

Heytesbury and others mathematically determined the distance covered by a body undergoing
uniformly accelerated motion (today solved by integration ), stating that “a moving body
uniformly acquiring or losing that increment [of speed] will traverse in some given time a
[distance] completely equal to that which it would traverse if it were moving continuously
through the same time with the mean degree [of speed]“.

Nicole Oresme Â at theÂ  University of Paris Â and the ItalianÂ  Giovanni di Casali
Â independently provided graphical demonstrations of this relationship, asserting
that the area under the line depicting the constant acceleration, represented the total
distance traveled.Â In a later mathematical commentary on Euclid’sÂ  Elements ,
Oresme made a more detailed general analysis in which he demonstrated that a body will acquire
in each successive increment of time an increment of any quality that increases as the odd
numbers. Since Euclid had demonstrated the sum of the odd numbers are the square numbers, the
total quality acquired by the body increases as the square of the time.

Renaissance mathematics

Portrait of Luca Pacioli , a painting traditionally attributed toÂ  Jacopo de’ Barbari ,
1495, ( Museo di Capodimonte ).

During theÂ  Renaissance , the development of mathematics and ofÂ  accounting Â were
intertwined.Â While there is no direct relationship between algebra and accounting, the
teaching of the subjects and the books published often intended for the children of merchants
who were sent to reckoning schools (inÂ  Flanders Â andÂ  Germany ) orÂ  abacus
schools Â (known as abbaco Â in Italy), where they learned the skills useful for trade
and commerce. There is probably no need for algebra in performingÂ  bookkeeping
Â operations, but for complex bartering operations or the calculation ofÂ  compound
interest , a basic knowledge of arithmetic was mandatory and knowledge of algebra was very
useful.

Luca Pacioli ‘sÂ  “Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et
ProportionalitÃ ” Â (Italian: “Review ofÂ  Arithmetic ,Â  Geometry ,Â 
Ratio Â andÂ  Proportion “) was first printed and published in Venice Â in 1494. It
included a 27-pageÂ  treatise Â onÂ  bookkeeping ,Â  “Particularis de Computis
et Scripturis” Â (Italian: “Details of Calculation and Recording”). It was
written primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a
source of pleasure from theÂ  mathematical puzzles Â it contained, and to aid the
education of their sons.Â In Summa Arithmetica , Pacioli introduced symbols forÂ  plus
and minus Â for the first time in a printed book, symbols that became standard notation in
Italian Renaissance mathematics. Summa Arithmetica Â was also the first known book
printed in Italy to containÂ  algebra . It is important to note that Pacioli himself had
borrowed much of the work ofÂ  Piero Della Francesca Â whom he plagiarized.

In Italy, during the first half of the 16th century,Â  Scipione del Ferro Â andÂ 
NiccolÃ² Fontana Tartaglia Â discovered solutions forÂ  cubic equations . Gerolamo
Cardano Â published them in his 1545 bookÂ  Ars Magna , together with a solution for
theÂ  quartic equations , discovered by his student Lodovico Ferrari . In 1572Â  Rafael
Bombelli Â published hisÂ  L’Algebra Â in which he showed how to deal with theÂ 
imaginary quantities Â that could appear in Cardano’s formula for solving cubic
equations.

Simon Stevin ‘s bookÂ  De Thiende Â (‘the art of tenths’), first published in
Dutch in 1585, contained the first systematic treatment ofÂ  decimal notation , which
influenced all later work on theÂ  real number system .

Driven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large areas,Â 
trigonometry Â grew to be a major branch of mathematics.Â  Bartholomaeus Pitiscus
Â was the first to use the word, publishing hisÂ  Trigonometria Â in 1595.
Regiomontanus’s table of sines and cosines was published in 1533.

Mathematics during the Scientific Revolution



17th century



The 17th century saw an unprecedented explosion of mathematical and scientific ideas across
Europe.Â  Galileo Â observed the moons of Jupiter in orbit about that planet, using a
telescope based on a toy imported from Holland.Â  Tycho Brahe Â had gathered an enormous
quantity of mathematical data describing the positions of the planets in the sky. Through his
position as Brahe’s assistant,Â  Johannes Kepler Â was first exposed to and
seriously interacted with the topic of planetary motion. Kepler’s calculations were made
simpler by the contemporaneous invention ofÂ  natural logarithms Â byÂ  John Napier
Â andÂ  Jost BÃŒrgi . Kepler succeeded in formulating mathematical laws of planetary
motion. The analytic geometry Â developed byÂ  RenÃ© Descartes
Â (1596â€“1650) allowed those orbits to be plotted on a graph, inÂ  Cartesian
coordinates .Â  Simon Stevin Â (1585) created the basis for modern decimal notation
capable of describing all numbers, whether rational or irrational.

Building on earlier work by many predecessors,Â  Isaac Newton Â discovered the laws of
physics explainingÂ  Kepler’s Laws , and brought together the concepts now known asÂ 
infinitesimal calculus . Independently,Â  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Â developed
calculus and much of the calculus notation still in use today. Science and mathematics had
become an international endeavor, which would soon spread over the entire world.

In addition to the application of mathematics to the studies of the heavens,Â  applied
mathematics Â began to expand into new areas, with the correspondence ofÂ  Pierre de
Fermat Â andÂ  Blaise Pascal . Pascal and Fermat set the groundwork for the
investigations ofÂ  probability theory Â and the corresponding rules ofÂ 
combinatorics Â in their discussions over a game ofÂ  gambling . Pascal, with hisÂ 
wager , attempted to use the newly developing probability theory to argue for a life devoted to
religion, on the grounds that even if the probability of success was small, the rewards were
infinite. In some sense, this foreshadowed the development ofÂ  utility theory Â in the
18thâ€“19th century.

18th century

Leonhard Euler Â byÂ  Emanuel Handmann .

The most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguablyÂ  Leonhard Euler . His
contributions range from founding the study ofÂ  graph theory Â with theÂ  Seven
Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg Â problem to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and
notations. For example, he named the square root of minus 1 with the symbolÂ  i , and he
popularized the use of the Greek letterÂ Ï€Â to stand for the ratio of a circle’s
circumference to its diameter. He made numerous contributions to the study of topology,
graph theory, calculus, combinatorics, and complex analysis, as evidenced by the multitude
of theorems and notations named for him.

Other important European mathematicians of the 18th century includedÂ  Joseph Louis
Lagrange , who did pioneering work in number theory, algebra, differential calculus, and the
calculus of variations, andÂ  Laplace who, in the age ofÂ  Napoleon Â did important
work on the foundations ofÂ  celestial mechanics Â and onÂ  statistics .

Modern mathematics



19th century



Throughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. In the 19th century
livedÂ  Carl Friedrich Gauss Â (1777â€“1855). Leaving aside his many
contributions to science, inÂ  pure mathematics Â he did revolutionary work onÂ 
functions Â of complex variables , inÂ  geometry , and on the convergence ofÂ  series .
He gave the first satisfactory proofs of theÂ  fundamental theorem of algebra and of
theÂ  quadratic reciprocity law .

Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry

This century saw the development of the two forms ofÂ  non-Euclidean geometry , where
theÂ  parallel postulate Â ofÂ  Euclidean geometry Â no longer holds. The Russian
mathematicianÂ  Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky Â and his rival, the Hungarian
mathematician JÃ¡nos Bolyai , independently defined and studiedÂ  hyperbolic
geometry , where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in
a triangle add up to less than 180Â°. Elliptic geometry Â was developed later in the 19th
century by the German mathematicianÂ  Bernhard Riemann ; here no parallel can be found and
the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180Â°. Riemann also developedÂ  Riemannian
geometry , which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined
the concept of aÂ  manifold , which generalize the ideas ofÂ  curves Â andÂ 
surfaces .

The 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal ofÂ  abstract algebra .Â  Hermann
Grassmann Â in Germany gave a first version ofÂ  vector spaces ,Â  William Rowan
Hamilton Â in Ireland developedÂ  noncommutative algebra . The British
mathematicianÂ  George Boole Â devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now
calledÂ  Boolean algebra , in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the
starting point of mathematical logic Â and has important applications inÂ  computer
science .

Augustin-Louis Cauchy ,Â  Bernhard Riemann , andÂ  Karl Weierstrass Â reformulated
the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.

Also, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored.Â  Niels Henrik Abel , a
Norwegian, andÂ  Ã‰variste Galois , a Frenchman, proved that there is no general
algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four (
Abelâ€“Ruffini theorem ). Other 19th century mathematicians utilized this in their
proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient toÂ  trisect an arbitrary
angle , to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square
equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these
problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of threeÂ 
dimensions Â in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations ofÂ 
parameter space Â andÂ  hypercomplex numbers .

Abel and Galois’s investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid
the groundwork for further developments ofÂ  group theory , and the associated fields
ofÂ  abstract algebra . In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group
theory as the ideal way to studyÂ  symmetry .

In the later 19th century,Â  Georg Cantor Â established the first foundations ofÂ 
set theory , which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the
common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor’s set theory, and the rise ofÂ 
mathematical logic Â in the hands ofÂ  Peano ,Â  L. E. J. Brouwer ,Â  David Hilbert
,Â  Bertrand Russell , andÂ  A.N. Whitehead , initiated a long running debate on theÂ 
foundations of mathematics .

The 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: theÂ 
London Mathematical Society Â in 1865, theÂ  SociÃ©tÃ© MathÃ©matique de France
Â in 1872, theÂ  Circolo Mathematico di Palermo Â in 1884, theÂ  Edinburgh
Mathematical Society Â in 1883, and the American Mathematical Society Â in 1888. The
first international, special-interest society, theÂ  Quaternion Society , was formed in
1899, in the context of aÂ  vector controversy .

A map illustrating theÂ  Four Color Theorem

The 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new
Ph.D.s in mathematics are awarded, and jobs are available in both teaching and industry.

In a 1900 speech to theÂ  International Congress of Mathematicians ,Â  David Hilbert
Â set out a list ofÂ  23 unsolved problems in mathematics . These problems, spanning many
areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th century mathematics. Today, 10
have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely
formulated to be stated as solved or not.

Notable historical conjectures were finally proved. In 1976,Â  Wolfgang Haken
Â andÂ  Kenneth Appel used a computer to prove theÂ  four color theorem .Â  Andrew
Wiles , building on the work of others, provedÂ  Fermat’s Last Theorem Â in 1995.Â 
Paul Cohen Â andÂ  Kurt GÃ¶del Â proved that theÂ  continuum hypothesis
Â isÂ  independent Â of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) theÂ 
standard axioms of set theory . In 1998Â  Thomas Callister Hales Â proved theÂ  Kepler
conjecture .

Mathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the
classification of finite simple groups Â (also called the “enormous theorem”),
whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and
filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, includingÂ  Jean
DieudonnÃ© Â andÂ  AndrÃ© Weil , publishing under theÂ  pseudonym Â ”
Nicolas Bourbaki “, attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous
whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on
mathematical education.

Differential geometry Â came into its own whenÂ  Einstein Â used it inÂ  general
relativity . Entire new areas of mathematics such asÂ  mathematical logic ,Â  topology ,
andÂ  John von Neumann ‘sÂ  game theory changed the kinds of questions that could be
answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of structures Â were abstracted using axioms
and given names likeÂ  metric spaces ,Â  topological spaces etc. As mathematicians do,
the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to category theory .Â 
Grothendieck Â andÂ  Serre Â recastÂ  algebraic geometry Â usingÂ  sheaf
theory . Large advances were made in the qualitative study ofÂ  dynamical systems
Â thatÂ  PoincarÃ© Â had begun in the 1890s.Â  Measure theory Â was developed
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include theÂ  Lebesgue
integral ,Â  Kolmogorov ‘s axiomatisation ofÂ  probability theory , and ergodic
theory .Â  Knot theory Â greatly expanded.Â  Quantum mechanics Â led to the
development of functional analysis . Other new areas include,Â  Laurent Schwarz ‘sÂ 
distribution theory ,Â  fixed point theory ,Â  singularity theory Â andÂ  RenÃ©
Thom ‘sÂ  catastrophe theory ,Â  model theory , andÂ  Mandelbrot ‘s fractals
.Â  Lie theory Â with itsÂ  Lie groups Â andÂ  Lie algebras Â became one of the
major areas of study.

The development and continual improvement ofÂ  computers , at first mechanical analog
machines and then digital electronic machines, allowedÂ  industry Â to deal with
larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and
communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this:Â  Alan
Turing ‘sÂ  computability theory ;Â  complexity theory ;Â  Claude Shannon
‘sÂ  information theory ;Â  signal processing ;Â  data analysis ;Â 
optimization Â and other areas ofÂ  operations research . In the preceding centuries
much mathematical focus was onÂ  calculus Â and continuous functions, but the rise of
computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance ofÂ  discrete
Â concepts and the expansion ofÂ  combinatorics includingÂ  graph theory . The speed
and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical
problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading
to areas such asÂ  numerical analysis Â andÂ  symbolic computation . Some of the most
important methods andÂ  algorithms Â of the 20th century are: theÂ  simplex
algorithm , theÂ  Fast Fourier Transform ,Â  error-correcting codes , theÂ  Kalman
filter Â fromÂ  control theory Â and theÂ  RSA algorithm Â ofÂ  public-key
cryptography .

At the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and
1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about theÂ  natural
numbers Â plus one of addition and multiplication, wasÂ  decidable , i.e. could be
determined by some algorithm. In 1931,Â  Kurt GÃ¶del Â found that this was not the case
for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known asÂ 
Peano arithmetic , was in factÂ  incompletable . (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good
deal ofÂ  number theory , including the notion ofÂ  prime number .) A consequence of
GÃ¶del’s twoÂ  incompleteness theorems Â is that in any mathematical system that
includes Peano arithmetic (including all ofÂ  analysis Â andÂ  geometry ), truth
necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements thatÂ  cannot be proved
Â within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, andÂ 
David Hilbert ‘s dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be
reformulated.

TheÂ  absolute value Â of the Gamma function on the complex plane.

One of the more colorful figures in 20th century mathematics wasÂ  Srinivasa Aiyangar
Ramanujan (1887â€“1920), an IndianÂ  autodidact Â who conjectured or proved
over 3000 theorems, including properties ofÂ  highly composite numbers , theÂ 
partition function Â and itsÂ  asymptotics , andÂ  mock theta functions . He also made
major investigations in the areas ofÂ  gamma functions ,Â  modular forms , divergent
series ,Â  hypergeometric series Â andÂ  prime number Â theory.

Paul ErdÅ‘s Â published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working
with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to theÂ  Kevin
Bacon Game , which leads to theÂ  ErdÅ‘s number Â of a mathematician. This describes
the “collaborative distance” between a person and Paul ErdÅ‘s, as measured by joint
authorship of mathematical papers.

As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to
specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in
mathematics and theÂ  Mathematics Subject Classification Â was dozens of pages
long.Â More and more mathematical journals Â were published and, by the end of the
century, the development of theÂ  world wide web Â led to online publishing.

21st century



In 2000, theÂ  Clay Mathematics Institute Â announced the sevenÂ  Millennium Prize
Problems , and in 2003 theÂ  PoincarÃ© conjecture Â was solved by Grigori Perelman
Â (who declined to accept any awards).

Most mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many
online-only journals are launched. There is an increasing drive towardsÂ  open access
publishing , first popularized by theÂ  arXiv Posted in History | Leave a comment
