      <b>Optimus Prime</b>\n                is the main protagonist and leader of the &quot;heroic&quot; faction (primarily the Autobots) in most of the various\n                <i>Transformers</i>\n                continuities. After his ship crashed on Earth, he remained unconscious for millions of years, then an earthquake on Tuesday, May 8, 1984, awoke the ship\'s repair system, which then repaired him and adapted him to have the ability to transform to an Earth vehicle. He is the leader of the Autobots, a faction of heroic Transformers from the planet Cybertron who wage their battles against the evil forces of the Decepticons. Optimus Prime is depicted as a heroic, brave and compassionate character who puts all his talent to use to improve the universe around him. Optimus has a strong sense of justice and righteousness, and has dedicated himself to the protection of all life, particularly the inhabitants of Earth; he will battle his foes with unyielding resolve.\n                <sup style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" id="cite_ref-0" class="reference">\n                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(Transformers)#cite_note-0" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">[1</a>\n                  ]\n                </sup>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The original Optimus Prime transforms into a cab over truck. The truck\'s cab transforms into the robot mode of Prime himself, with vast strength and armed with a laser rifle. Contained within his chest is the mystic talisman known as the Autobot Matrix of Leadership (or Creation Matrix, depending on the continuity), carried by all Autobot leaders and passed down through the ages. The comic book continuities tend to claim that Optimus\' direct predecessor as Prime and thus bearer of the Matrix was Sentinel Prime, a fact which is part of the Dreamwave comics canon. In the cartoon continuity, it is unknown from whom Optimus inherited the talisman, as Optimus is already named as a Prime when Alpha Trion rebuilds him from his former self\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dwhich appears to indicate that Alpha Trion may have given Prime the Matrix at that point, just after the transformation of Orion Pax into Optimus Prime. This change is depicted in the episode\n                <i>War Dawn</i>\n                . The truck\'s trailer disconnects and transforms into the\n                <b>Combat Deck</b>\n                , a mobile battle-station/command headquarters with an &quot;Auto-Launcher&quot; robot armed with assorted artillery and beam weapons. It can also serve as a radio antenna for battlefield communications between the Autobots. The Combat Deck can launch Prime\'s third component,\n                <b>Roller</b>\n                , a mobile scout buggy that can easily slip behind enemy lines. Optimus\' senses are tied into Roller\'s, and can perceive what Roller does. Injury to one component is felt by each of the others, and while Prime could survive the destruction of either, despite the slight degree of autonomy they possess, the Combat Deck and Roller would not be able to survive without him.\n              </p>\n              <pre>\n                Additional powers included in the animated series and comics are short-range optic blasts, holographic map projections and deployable hydro-foils designed by Wheeljack which allowed Prime and the other Autobots to traverse bodies of water with ease. One of Prime\'s abilities was the ability to retract his right hand unit and replace it with a glowing axe.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Across the assorted continuities of the original\n                <i>Transformers</i>\n                universe, there have been various interpretations of Optimus Prime. One of Prime\'s most notable characteristics in any form was his adamant commitment to leadership by example, and avoidance of any hypocrisy in his command, but beyond this, the animated series leaned towards Optimus Prime as a straightforward, wise and essentially upbeat battlefield general. The Marvel Comics series, on the other hand, in addition to these more obvious characteristics, suggested a Prime secretly plagued by self-doubt and, more importantly, a conflicted sense of pacifism that often made him an extremely reluctant warrior. It was occasionally implied that the conflict with the Decepticons lasted as long as it did primarily because of his unwillingness to take a more aggressive stance.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                The animated series revealed other minor details about Optimus Prime\'s personality and personal life \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d for example, his dislike of rap music(&quot;Blaster Blues&quot; and &quot;Quest for Survival&quot;), which set him at odds with music-loving characters like Blaster and Jazz. Prime also enjoys televised sports, most notably basketball which he even plays (&quot;The Master Builder&quot;), as well as setting up a basketball court outside the Ark. Though Prime\'s personality is like that of a human man age 40-50, he is not above watching afternoon soap operas (in the episode &quot;Prime Target&quot;, he is heard groaning out loud when the soap opera he is watching with the other Autobots gets interrupted for a news report).\n              </pre>\n              <p>\n                <br clear="none"></br>\n              </p>\n

    In Marvel Comics\' comic series, before the Great War broke out on Cybertron, the robot who would be Optimus Prime (before he received the Matrix of Leadership from Sentinel Prime) was a Transformer of note, displaying his skills in the Infraformers Sharpshooting Competition. Subsequently, when the war began, Prime quickly made a name for himself as a combat leader of the Autobots.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                On a mission with the Triggerbots to stop Megatron from claiming the Underbase, Prime was forced to jettison the massive databank into space to prevent anyone from acquiring its power, but with this action, he proved his wisdom and skill to the Autobot Council of Elders; this led to even more rapid advancement, eventually leading him to field command over the Autobot armies.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Four million years ago, Cybertron \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d shaken from its orbit and drifting through space \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d came under threat when it floated into the path of an asteroid swarm. Prime led a group of elite Autobot warriors on the Autobot starship, the Ark, on a mission to destroy the asteroids, and although successful, in the aftermath of this mission the Ark was attacked by Decepticons, hoping to overcome their weakened foes. Intent on keeping the secrets of the Ark from the Decepticons, Prime set the craft on a suicide course, crashing it into the prehistoric planet Earth.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                In 1984 A.D., a volcanic eruption re-activated the Ark, which in turn brought the Transformers back on-line. Prime led the Autobots in their opening battles to prevent the Decepticons from plundering Earth\'s resources, but following their initial victory, the Transformers were all deactivated by Shockwave. Prime was decapitated by Shockwave, and had the energy of the Creation Matrix leeched from his mind to give life to Shockwave\'s creations, the Constructicons (although Shockwave was unaware that the Matrix was not merely a program in Prime\'s mind, but a physical object in his chest). Before Shockwave could give life to his next Decepticon, Jetfire, Prime transferred the Matrix energy into the mind of Buster Witwicky, who used the energy to turn Jetfire on Shockwave, allowing Prime to reclaim his body and retake leadership of the Autobots, giving Jetfire true life as a reward.\n              </pre>\n              <p>\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reagan-transformers.jpg" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">[1]</a>\n              </p>\n              <pre>\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reagan-transformers.jpg" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">[2]</a>\n                Optimus Prime meets President Ronald Reagan\n                <i>Around this time, he would even meet Ronald Reagan in a story in the 1985 U.K. annual.</i>\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                <i>\n                  Meanwhile, however, the U.K. offices of Marvel Comics were producing their own storylines. Here, writer Simon Furman offered a different take on Prime, one that was weary of the war he had been forced to fight. In the &quot;Prey&quot; storyline beginning in U.K. #96 Prime arranged for a Wheeljack built copy of himself to be destroyed to see how the Autobots could cope without him. Unfortunately the plan was derailed by Megatron and the Predacons, who attacked him. During the battle Prime, Megatron and Ultra Magnus were transported to Earth \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d with Prime accidentally interrupting his own funeral service.

Prime was victorious, but Megatron implemented a cheat code that killed Prime later. Autobot surgeon Ratchet\'s subsequent efforts to restore him were unsuccessful, and his body was launched into space, the Autobots unaware of the presence of the physical Matrix object within the corpse. The funeral barge eventually crashed on a giant moon; as it lay there for an untold time, the Matrix reached out to nearby living organisms, studying and recreating them. One such recreated being became known as Death Bringer.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Prime\'s personality had been copied onto a floppy disk by the technician running the game, Ethan Zachary, who employed him in various video game scenarios he developed. Prime\'s damaged mind led him to believe that he himself was a video game character, and in an attempt to bring him back to life, Goldbug, Joyride, Slapdash and Getaway took the disk to the planet Nebulos. They built a new body for Optimus Prime, and even upgraded it with the ability to combine with the trailer to form a larger robot. In an effort to keep Transformers off their planet, however, the Nebulans had poisoned their fuel, and the sensation of dying convinced Prime that he was truly alive, and not a game character. To save his life, the Nebulan scientist Hi-Q bonded with him, creating\n                <b>Powermaster Optimus Prime</b>\n                . A UK story set around this time in UK #198 would see Prime as the star of his own Christmas special, as he returned to Earth and tried to rekindle his feeling for the planet. After a battle between his own forces and an advance force from Cybertron ruined a small town\'s Christmas festivities he realized bringing the Transformers to Earth was far worse than anything his troops could have done and vowed to protect its inhabitants from Decepticon aggression.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>Optimus Prime\'s first actions as leader were to ally the Autobots with Scorponok\'s Decepticons in defeating Starscream when the later gained the power of the Underbase. </pre>\n              <pre>\n                <i>In the U.K.</i>\n                Transformers\n                <i>stories, Prime and his Autobots later battled a murderous mechanoid named Death Bringer, which Prime recognized as a creation of the Matrix.</i>\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Later, the Transformers were all transported to Cybertron by Primus to battle Unicron, Prime managed to successfully reacquire and purify the Matrix after Unicron killed Thunderwing and his taint upon it. Prime then sacrificed his life one more time to destroy Unicron by plunging the Matrix into his maw. However, the Powermaster process had been working to fully bond Prime and Hi-Q, and with Prime now destroyed, the process completed itself in Hi-Q\'s body, and the two minds and souls became one. Hi-Q\'s biomechanical body was stripped down and reconstructed by the Last Autobot, resurrecting Optimus Prime once more with the two minds now one.

Plagued by nightmarish visions of a life-destroying entity called &quot;the Swarm,&quot; Prime looked into Cybertron\'s past and discovered that Jhiaxus and his kind were the result of further unintentional Transformer reproduction, their nature and intent distilled to the purest, most unemotional form of conquest, and that the Swarm was the by-product of this process. Entering into an alliance with the recreated Megatron\'s Decepticons to combat the Swarm and Jhiaxus, Prime was consumed by the abomination and destroyed, but at the last moment, unleashed the energies of the Matrix into the Swarm, purifying it. In parting, the Swarm recreated Prime in a new form, (based on his &quot;Hero&quot; toy), and he and Megatron set out to lead the united Autobots and Decepticons into a new age.\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(Transformers)#cite_note-1" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  <sup style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">[2</sup>\n                </a>\n                ]\n              </pre>\n              <p>\n                <br clear="none"></br>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                <br clear="none"></br>\n              </p>\n              <h2>\n                <span id="Animated_series" class="mw-headline">Animated series</span>\n                <span class="editsection">\n                  <a title="Edit Animated series section" href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime?action=edit&amp;section=2" shape="rect">\n                    <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" class="sprite edit-pencil"></img>\n                    Edit\n                  </a>\n                </span>\n              </h2>\n              <p>\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orionpax.jpg" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">[5]</a>\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orionpax.jpg" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">[6]</a>\n                Orion Pax As seen in the episode &quot;War Dawn&quot;, Optimus Prime began his life as a robot named Orion Pax, a mostly defenseless dock worker during the Golden Age of Cybertron nine million years ago, with a girlfriend named Ariel, and a best friend named Dion. At the time, a new breed of robot had recently appeared on the planet with new flight capabilities in robot mode that made Orion idolize them. Unfortunately for Orion, when Megatron, the leader of the new group of robots, approached him with inquiries about using one of the dock warehouses, Orion was swayed by Megatron, and he and Ariel were severely wounded when Megatron and his forces then attacked in order to claim the energy stored there. Searching for someone to help them, the time-displaced Aerialbots took Orion and Ariel to the ancient Autobot, Alpha Trion, who used them as the first subjects for the new reconstruction process he had developed \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d rebuilding the frail Autobot frames into battle-hardy configurations.

In the ensuing struggle, the G-forces of a nearby planet pulled both craft down, and the Autobots\' ship crashed into a volcano, thrusting all the occupants into emergency stasis. Four million years later, in the Earth year 1984 A.D., a volcanic eruption jarred the ship\'s computer, Teletraan I back to life, and it reactivated the Decepticons, programming them with new Earth-based disguise modes. As a parting gesture, Starscream fired upon the Autobot ship, creating a landslide.

He has suffered his fair share of battlefield scrapes, almost meeting his end when his vital cosmotron component was critically damaged by the Decepticon jets and Laserbeak, having his body be disassembled and turned into Decepticon trophies (such as turning much of his body into a pet &quot;alligaticon&quot; and one of his arms into a defense laser).\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Prime suffered a severe \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d though unfair \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d defeat when Megatron challenged him to one-on-one combat while imbued with the different abilities of all the Decepticons. The loser would leave Earth. However, Teletraan I discovered the deception in time and the Autobots were able to drive the Decepticons off. In &quot;Prime Problem&quot;, Megatron created a clone of him, which cause confusion with the other Autobots which lead to tests. However, Windcharger and Spike were able to identify the clone before it led the Autobots into their demise.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                In &quot;Prime Target&quot;, the big game hunter Lord Cholmondeley set his sights on the ultimate trophy, the head of Optimus Prime. In order to lure Optimus in, Cholmondeley captured the Autobots Tracks, Bumblebee, Jazz, Beachcomber, Grapple, Blaster and Inferno. Windcharger and Huffer were able to avoid being trapped. When Cosmos learned of the location Cholmondeley was keeping the captured Transformers, Optimus Prime accepted Cholmondeley\'s challenge to meet him alone. Although interrupted by the Decepticons Astrotrain and Blitzwing\'s attempt to ally the Decepticons with Cholmondeley, Optimus defeated the big game hunter and freed the Autobots. Cholmondeley and the stolen jet were handed over to the Soviets by the Autobots as punishment for his actions.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Throughout the first two seasons, Optimus Prime has led the Autobots to many victories, like stopping Megatron from controlling the crystal of power (&quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot;), stopping the Dinobots\' rebellion by saving Grimlock (&quot;War of the Dinobots&quot;), defeated Devastator with his detach arm (&quot;City of Steel&quot;), helped capture Nightbird (&quot;Enter the Nightbird&quot;), rescued Blaster and Cosmos from the Decepticons on the Moon with the help of Omega Supreme (&quot;Blaster Blues&quot;), and help saved Perceptor and the other Transformers from the cosmic rust disease (&quot;Cosmic Rust&quot;).\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Over the course of the next twenty years, the Decepticons succeeded in seizing control of all of Cybertron, forcing the Autobots to operate from their new city on Earth, and from two bases on Cybertron\'s moons. In the Earth year 2005 A.D., Prime was stationed on Moonbase One, and dispatched troops to Earth to acquire energy for an upcoming strike on Cybertron. The Decepticons, however, got wind of the plan and used the shuttle run to attack Autobot City; a distress call summoned Prime and support troops to Earth, and in the fearsome ensuing fight with Megatron, Optimus Prime sustained fatal injuries, but not before turning the tide of battle and forcing the Decepticons to flee. Despite the efforts of Perceptor, Optimus Prime went offline. The Matrix, and with it leadership of the Autobots, fell into the hands of Ultra Magnus, Galvatron, and subsequently to Rodimus Prime. His last words were &quot;\n                <i>Until that day... \'till all are one.</i>\n                &quot;\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Prime\'s body was entombed in a massive deep-space mausoleum with the many other fallen Autobots, but his corpse was desecrated by the Quintessons in 2006, when they reanimated it as part of an attempt to destroy the Autobots by using Prime to lure their space fleet into a trap. However, the Matrix was able to purify Prime of the Quintesson influence, and he ordered the other Autobots to clear out while he piloted his flagship into the Quintessons\' detonator, triggering the explosion of a nearby sun. Prime was believed to have been destroyed in the explosion. According to &quot;The Return of Optimus Prime&quot;, Prime\'s body was recovered from the craft by two human scientists, Jessica Morgan and Gregory Swofford, just minutes before the explosion. However, as their ship departed, it was coated with solar spores released by the explosion of the sun. Jessica\'s father, Mark Morgan, loathed the Transformers (both Autobot and Decepticon), and his hatred only grew when an attempt by the Decepticons to steal a heat-resistant alloy he had developed resulted in Jessica being paralyzed. Swofford and Morgan reconstructed Optimus Prime\'s body in an attempt to use it as a delivery system for the spores, which induced enmity and madness in every sentient being they came into contact with, in order to destroy the Transformers.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                However, when they could not reanimate him, they used his body as a lure instead, bringing the Autobots to their lab, where they were infected. As this &quot;Hate Plague&quot; proceeded to spread across the galaxy, Sky Lynx retrieved a Quintesson, who fully restored Optimus Prime to life. Coating himself in Morgan\'s heat-resistant alloy, Prime reclaimed the Matrix from Rodimus and unleashed its concentrated wisdom to destroy the Hate Plague.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                In 2007, Prime began to suffer from visions following the release of the Matrix\'s energy, which foretold a great transformation for Cybertron. Events began with the Decepticons\' theft of the key to the Plasma Energy Chamber, which forced Prime to consult Alpha Trion within Vector Sigma, and Prime learned that the mega-computer had orchestrated events in order to restore Cybertron\'s Golden Age. When the Plasma Energy Chamber was opened and threatened to drive Earth\'s Sun supernova, Spike Witwicky and the Nebulans who had become involved in the conflict as a result of these events were able to drain off the excess solar energy and revitalize Cybertron. With the Decepticons driven off Cybertron, and Nebulon free from tyranny, Cybertron enters into a Golden Age of peace and prosperity under the leadership of Optimus Prime and the Autobots.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                The seldom-seen &quot;5th season&quot; re-airing of the show featured the G1 episodes retold by a stop-motion Powermaster Optimus Prime to the live-action youngster Tommy Kennedy. No real back story was ever established for Prime becoming a Powermaster, but the new sequences were said to take place after the four previous seasons, indicating that in the original Sunbow continuity at least, Prime became a Powermaster at some point.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Although the animated series ended in the U.S. after\n                <i>The Rebirth</i>\n                , Optimus Prime continued to appear in animated sequences in the Transformers toy commercials, progressing from Powermaster to Action Master, and even appearing as a computer-generated Combat Hero Optimus Prime. Many episodes of the series are re-aired again to promote\n                <i>Transformers: Generation 2</i>\n                . During these sequences, computer-generated scenes featuring key (recolored) G1 characters are borrowed from Generation 2 commercials to serve as an opening, closing, and commercial bumpers. Optimus Prime is shown in the opening and closing fighting Generation 2\'s Ramjet.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                While the\n                <i>Transformers</i>\n                animated series came to an end in America with\n                <i>The Rebirth</i>\n                in 1987, across the Pacific, in Japan, it was decided to continue production of the show with three new, exclusive animated series (spin-offs) to continue the story. The first of these series,\n                <i>Transformers: The Headmasters</i>\n                , supplanted the events of\n                <i>The Rebirth</i>\n                , picking up one year after the events that saw Optimus Prime\'s return to life. In the beginning of the series it generally shows Optimus Prime alive again.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                In the interim year, with the Decepticons not having been heard from, the Autobots had entered into an even closer relationship with Earth, and had begun the colonization of other worlds, the first of which was the planet Athenia, where Optimus Prime was stationed. It soon became apparent, however, that when Prime had released the energy of the Matrix to cure the Hate Plague, the consequences were more far-reaching than he had anticipated \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d without the energy of the Matrix to act as a balancing factor, Vector Sigma had become destabilized, and the Decepticons suddenly returned to exploit this, assaulting Cybertron in order to seize control of the mega-computer. Prime took a squad of troops to aid in the battle on the planet, and when the arrival of the Autobot Headmasters tipped the battle in their favor, Prime broke off from the main attack and headed down into the depths of the planet, planning on stabilizing Vector Sigma at any cost.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Guided through the dangers of the planet\'s catacombs by the spirit of Alpha Trion while the other Autobots searched for the Matrix on Earth, Prime eventually arrived at the computer, only to find his way barred by Cyclonus and Scourge. Hot Rod then arrived with the Matrix, with which Alpha Trion merged, re-energizing it and transforming Hot Rod back into Rodimus Prime; for the first time, the two Primes fought side-by-side and defeated Galvatron.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Before Rodimus could implement the Matrix to stabilize Vector Sigma, however, Optimus Prime sacrificed himself to perform the task, merging with the computer and restoring its balance to save the planet \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d dying again only a few short episodes after his rebirth.\n The second of the Japanese-exclusive\n                <i>Transformers</i>\n                series, 1988\'s\n                <i>Transformers: Super-God Masterforce</i>\n                did not actually feature Optimus Prime himself, but it did feature one of his bodies. This series sees human truck driver Ginrai merge with and control a Transtector, a lifeless Transformer body, which bears a striking resemblance to Optimus Prime. Although not revealed in the main forty two episodes of the series, an additional clip show episode produced after the series explained that this was because the body was intended to be used by Prime, only to be stolen and hidden on Earth by the series antagonist, Devil Z.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                <i>Generation 1</i>\n                Prime makes a cameo in an episode of\n                <i>Transformers: Armada</i>\n                alongside other characters from the original cartoon.\n              </pre>\n              <p>\n                <br clear="none"></br>\n              </p>\n              <h2>\n                <span id="Books" class="mw-headline">Books</span>\n                <span class="editsection">\n                  <a title="Edit Books section" href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime?action=edit&amp;section=3" shape="rect">\n                    <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" class="sprite edit-pencil"></img>\n                    Edit\n                  </a>\n                </span>\n              </h2>\n              <p>Optimus Prime appeared in the following books: </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  The 1984 sticker and story book\n                  <i>Return to Cybertron</i>\n                  written by Suzanne Weyn and published by Marvel Books.\n                  <sup style="line-height: 1em;

In this realm, he was approached by the Predacon Sandstorm, who tried to plead for the help of Prime and the other legendary Transformers in dealing with a Unicron/Predacon hybrid named Shokaract.

Megatron unleashed a full-power weapon blast at Optimus Prime\'s face, near-fatally injuring him. However, Optimus Primal proceeded to take Prime\'s spark into his body to protect it from surgical trauma while his injuries were repaired. The subsequent power increase caused by Prime\'s spark\'s connection to the Matrix augmented Primal into the large, transmetal &quot;Optimal Optimus&quot; form with three alternate modes (jet, land vehicle, and transmetal gorilla). Then, with the repairs complete, Prime\'s spark was restored, and he briefly activated before sinking back into normal stasis.\n                <sup style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">\n                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(Transformers)#cite_note-8" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">[9</a>\n                  ]\n                </sup>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                When animating the scene in which Primal removes Prime\'s spark, Mainframe\'s animators consulted\n                <i>The Transformers: The Movie</i>\n                for reference on the interior of Prime\'s chest.

After taking note of a battle in which the Autobot leader Sentinel Prime had been killed by Megatron, he was summoned to the Council of Elders and informed that the Matrix had chosen him to be the next leader of the Autobots. He received the Autobot Matrix of Leadership shortly thereafter, and almost arranged for the Autobot evacuation of Cybertron, intending to leave the Decepticons to their own devices, until a battle with Megatron beneath the planet\'s surface, accompanied by visions from the Matrix, stirred him on to fight for the safety of his homeworld.

They planned to return to Cybertron aboard the newly constructed\n                <i>Ark II</i>\n                , but the ship was destroyed as part of a military conspiracy to take control of the Transformers. However, a terrorist organization run by the enigmatic Lazarus was able to seize control of several of the Transformers that fell back to Earth, while the U.S. military located Prime\'s body. Before his departure, Prime had entrusted a small portion of the Matrix to Spike Witwicky, who was forced by the product chief, General Hallo, to use it to reactivate Prime. Functional again, Prime used the Matrix to reactivate more of his fallen comrades, and then faced off against Megatron in San Francisco.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Following this, Prime began to experience subconscious urgings, leading both the Autobots and the Decepticons to the Arctic Circle, where Shockwave arrived to greet them \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and arrest them as war criminals. Shockwave had succeeded in ending the war on Cybertron, but Prime soon fell in with a rebel Autobot group that had discovered Shockwave had greater agenda. Rallying Transformers across Cybertron to the cause, Prime faced Shockwave in battle but was defeated and had the Matrix ripped from him and used to activate Vector Sigma. Before Shockwave could make full use of the mega-computer\'s data, however, Ultra Magnus (in this continuity, Prime\'s brother) arrived and bested him.

Prime was turned into a Cobra Sentry Missile System tank (a 1985 Sears store exclusive red repaint of the HISS tank).\n                <sup style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">\n                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(Transformers)#cite_note-10" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">[11</a>\n                  ]\n                </sup>\n                After an attack on a U.N. summit in Washington D.C. he was, however, able to get a message to Wheeljack, alerting G.I. Joe to where the Cobra base was hidden. Subsequently he and the other captive Autobots (and Decepticons) broke free, and he battled and defeated his enemy Megatron. The Transformers then returned to Cybertron in a second Ark Class vessel, but not before gifting their human allies with a surprising technological boon: The ability to build and usemecha based on Transformers technology.\n              </p>\n              <pre>\n                Sadly, Prime\'s homecoming was not all he had hoped for: the Decepticon Shockwave had taken control of the planet. Prime and the other Transformers were forced to go underground, waging a guerrilla war against the Decepticons. Around this time Cobra would attempt to steal Teletran-3, but their attempt to teleport directly into the chamber would set off a catastrophic malfunction, one that threatened to crack open time itself. Optimus Prime and the Stunticons were amongst those who found themselves sent back in time. He was reformatted into a 1920s semi-truck.

Mindful of the dangers of allowing humans like Cobra access to Cybertronian technology, Prime sent Perceptor, Grimlock, Arcee and Bumblebee on a mission to Earth. As it turned out Prime\'s fears were well founded: the U.S. government had used parts from Megatron to create Serpent O.R., a cyborg designed to be a perfect weapon. A raid by Cobra allowed it to escape and gather an army of Decepticons on Cybertron, killing Bumblebee in the process. Despite the grief of losing Bumblebee, Prime continued on and rallied his comrades to do the same. Attacking the Autobot capital city, Serpentor\'s forces proved overwhelming, and Prime voluntarily to surrender to ensure the Decepticons would cease fire. Realizing Serpentor wanted the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, Prime broke free as Serpentor was distracted, but was unable to kill him, promptly being attacked and beaten near death by Razorclaw and Motormaster. He was subsequently forced to watch as Serpentor opened the Matrix. The result was not what anyone expected \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d Serpentor was not only reformatted into a Transformers-size mechanoid but was shown the futility of the fighting by the Matrix. At this point Cobra Commander was able to take control of Serpentor\'s body, only being defeated by Hawk opening the Matrix, transforming him into a great leader and rendering Cobra Commander comatose. As the Joes prepared to head home, Prime promised to record the Hawk-led humans\' future.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Prime appeared again in the fourth crossover \'Black Horizon\'.

In a damned-if-they-do, damned-if-they-don\'t situation, it would mean that saving all the Autobots from Unicron would result in Prime and others such as Prowl, Wheeljack, Ironhide and Ratchet still dying per the original events. But it was hoped they may be able to at least partly avoid such an outcome by sending a &quot;ship in a bottle&quot; back in time \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d a message to their past selves about all they had learned.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Upon discovering that the Matrix was the key to destroying Unicron, Optimus Prime and\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Magnus" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Ultra Magnus</a>\n                went on alone to face Unicron, while the rest of the Autobots executed the plan to restore the original timeline, Operation Distant Thunder. It was hoped that at least one of these plans would be successful. Prime was injured in the confrontation with Unicron, and although his injuries were not mortal, he passed the Matrix to Magnus, who shed his outer armor and managed to successfully complete the mission, resulting in the destruction of Unicron.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Distant Thunder was ultimately unsuccessful, however as the universe started to rip apart, a black Optimus Prime clone appeared, splitting the Binaltech universe into its own separate continuity, while also restoring the original timeline and stabilizing the multiverse. The clone, obviously friendly to the Transformers, proclaimed that the Binaltech universe must be allowed to continue, as it was important to the future. Optimus Prime questioned the black doppelganger, who explained only that he carried &quot;the Protector\'s&quot; spark, but refused to reveal any more detailed information than that. Soon after however, the clone, who was originally developed by Dr Archeville as a weapon of evil, ejected the &quot;good&quot; spark that had invaded and taken over the black figure, reverted to its original evil programming and, now no longer just a black version of Optimus but the malevolent Nemesis Prime (Black Convoy), escaped.\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                Per Ravage\'s original plan, with Unicron defeated, the Decepticons returned to conquer the Transformers. However, Optimus Prime also planned for this event, and sent Mirage to press a switch, buried deep within Cybertron, that would render all Transformers inert. (This was seen at the conclusion of the &quot;Five Faces of Darkness&quot; story arc from the original animated series.) Optimus hoped that although all the Transformers would be rendered inoperative, the war would be stopped, and that the humans would be able to reactivate the Transformers in the future. However, this plan had the surprising side-effect that only those with original Cybertronian bodies were deactivated \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d those with Earth-made Binaltech bodies continued to function. And thus, the Autobots effectively won the war, with the large army of Binaltech Autobots easily outnumbering the few Decepticons who had managed to procure Binaltech upgrades (effectively just Nemesis Prime and Shockwave, who escaped with Megatron and their other inert comrades).\n              </pre>\n              <pre>\n                With the major threats taken care of, Optimus Prime turned his and the Autobots\' attention to identifying and shutting down the rogue projects taking place across Earth using stolen Binaltech technology and secrets. It was during one of these missions that Optimus Prime faced off against Nemesis Prime, with both of them in Binaltech\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Ram" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Dodge Ram</a>\n                forms. Initially, things looked bad for Optimus Prime, as he was no match for his opponent\'s spectral armor. However, the Protector merged with Prime, and the enormous power that resulted allowed Prime to reflect Nemesis Prime\'s final attack, obliterating the evil Decepticon. Optimus Prime recalls the union of the two sparks being familiar, from an event in the distant past, and is also reassured by the Protector about &quot;the seeds of the future&quot;, revealing the Protector to be\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Primal" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Optimus Primal</a>\n                .\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(Transformers)#cite_note-14" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  <sup style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" id="cite_ref-14" class="reference">[15</sup>\n                </a>\n                ]\n              </pre>\n              <h2>\n                <span id=".5Bedit.5DToys" class="mw-headline">\n                  [\n                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Optimus_Prime_(Transformers)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">edit</a>\n                  ]Toys\n                </span>\n                <span class="editsection">\n                  <a title="Edit [edit]Toys section" href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime?action=edit&amp;section=15" shape="rect">\n                    <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" class="sprite edit-pencil"></img>\n                    Edit\n                  </a>\n                </span>\n              </h2>\n              <pre>Through the years, there have been many action figures representing the original incarnation of Optimus Prime, some of which have featured in fiction, others of which have not. </pre>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  <b>\n                    <i>Generation 1</i>\n                    Optimus Prime\n                  </b>\n                  (1984)\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <dl>\n                <dd>\n                  The original Optimus Prime toy, with Combat Deck and Roller.

The figure included three optional hands apart from the regular clenched fists, including a right hand to hold the gun or to give a &quot;Come hither&quot; finger movement, a pointing right hand, and an open left hand used to hold the Matrix or for more choices in posing. Accessories include Prime\'s characteristic rifle, with the handle held to the main cannon by a peg to enable it to rotate, and the Matrix which cannot be held in the fists or put into the chest but can be held with the aforementioned open hand.

Like the other late-run Binaltech figures (Bluestreak, Argent Meister and Arcee), Convoy does not include the trading card or glossy booklet found in most earlier Binaltech figures.\n                </dd>\n              </dl>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  <b>\n                    <i>Universe</i>\n                    Generation 1 Series Optimus Prime\n                  </b>\n                  (2008)\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <dl>\n                <dd>\n                  A remold of the original Optimus Prime toy with slightly altered colors.
