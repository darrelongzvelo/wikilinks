Â Issue #2 – Core of the CORPS:

By DAMM

*spoiler alert on a mass scale!!!



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/glc_56_000.jpg?w=480

Why Bedard , Kirkham, Batt and Ruffinoâ€™s run on GL Corps looks to be the new definition
of the GL Corps and why The New Guardians is going to be the best of the DCnu



Upon hearing that the Green Lantern titles were going on pretty much unchanged, I was more than
a little thrilled. A little bit of blue hope sparked in me about the reboot. The reason is simple
I love the run in GL Corps #53 â€“ 60 and it is the very definition of the new Corps, both in
characterization and in structure but mostly in the inherent feel of the Universe. The
creative team on this arc has transcended the often questionable (see how nice I was?)
editorial direction of the DCU, moving the characters beyond space cops to true cosmic heroes
in specific roles for an emotionally balanced realm of interpersonal ideals and abstract
visions made reality. From this point forward there is an inherent comprehension of the soul
of the Guardians, the necessity of anger and fear and a need to explore the infinite galaxies
patrolled by the Corps. The Corps is relevant again. Among all the Sinestro Corps /Blackest
Night/Brightest Day run-amuckery (there was a lot inside those but to be fair it was a fun ride)
this single arc solidified and validated what DC was trying to do – make the Green Lantern
section of the universe (itâ€™s a big chunk!) congruent, exciting, fresh and
marketable without completely tarnishing, rewriting, or desecrating the characters or
their continuity. That is an amazing feat. It needs to be broken down and analyzed sure but it
needs NOT to be overlooked because when the reboot is over (succeed or fail) and we look back at
the Green Lantern Universe we need to know where it was defined and set up for success.

Â Bedard, Batt, Kirkham

Chemistry. It is the lightning in a bottle blast of the muse and the market launched from the
hands of master craftsmen and it is rare. So often it is a short lived beast that is constantly
tried to be defibrillated back into to its former glory by marketing suits and fanboys like
myself to not let it slip away, this is organic and solid and it radiates through the pages like a
DCU animated movie but geared just for us in details with no regard for â€œbuilt in
audiencesâ€� or whether or not it suits a TV channel ; but they had fans in mind. At least
they had a standard that a fan could be proud of. I canâ€™t imagine how many rewrites Mr.
Bedard did because he took no shortcuts or easy outs at all. A closer look is required and
Iâ€™m your guy, I guess.

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/glc_55_000.jpg?w=480





THE STORY â€“ I read these books independently from the other titles and first. It is a
tale all its own and the other parts are not necessary for a fine read. It also caused me to go and
pick up the other runs in War of the Green Lanterns by Johns, Tomasi, Mahnke and Pasarin, after I
was pretty much resigned to letting those titles (Green Lantern and Emerald Warriors ) lapse.
Â I am glad I did War of the Green Lanterns is phenomenal, but Bedardâ€™s work is the
shining jewel in the writing chain.

The first part, starting with issue 53â€™s focuses on the introduction of one of the most
exciting and menacing solo entities introduced into the GLU in a long while , the Weaponer. OK
so it was not his introduction but this is the story that puts the meat on an already impressive
backstory skeleton. The shield/hammer white energy construct weapon is at once congruous to
the other energy assailants of the Corps and other Lanterns yet the adaptability and
brilliant conception make it groundbreaking. Bedard weaves his words in the narrative with
concise direct voice so heavily tinged in intensity, you may actually want to look away fro m
the text! I felt a sense of a anxiety when The Weaponer abducted Sinestroâ€™s daughter
(who does that?) and genuine astonishment when the Weaponer joins the Sinestro Corps. But the
highlight of the first part of this story is a bare knuckle, fisticuff royale between Sinestro
and Kyle Rayner that will forever be remembered as the day we learn how truly tough Thaal
Sinestro is. In the exchange, The Master of Fear Energy says, â€œThis style of boxing is
called Hammerfist. It was taught to me by the Korugarian Grandmaster Tivas Kark. Who taught
you to fight?â€� Kyle responds with a solar plexus uppercut saying, â€œ BATMAN
.â€� I wonâ€™t tell you who wins or spoil any more climactic story points but this
story is near perfectly planned.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/glc_54_007.jpg?w=480



The second part of this arc is a War of the Green Lantern stream and when they are read in order
with the other books stand out as clever, honest and logical. The notion of our favorite
Lanterns all becoming other colors (even the forbidden ones!!!) that seems a little absurd in
Green Lantern and conceptually elusive in Warriors (both are decent books, but not anything
too special) becomes fantastic and alive under Bedardâ€™s direction and dialogue. Guy
Gardner is more vibrant and perfectly placed than ever as if he never belonged in any space
before now and all the changes, Warrior and all were to make him for this day. Kyle who is
infinitely still more interesting at this point in DC continuity than Hal (we will see after
the re-launch) finds what he has always had more than, hope and we finally admit what we have
known all along â€“ John Stewart is too unshakably good to be a Green Lantern. There I said
it. He is so shiningly moral and unbreakable compassion (even at the expense of Mogoâ€™s
life, to save countless others â€“ a brilliant and relevant comic book assassination).
As for Hal, well when in the hands of Bedard he is recognizable as Hal. That is quite a lot if you
think about it. Plus, he looks good in yellow.

THE PENCILS â€“ Tyler Kirkham is currently the cutting edge in flights and tights visual
storytelling. It is so stunningly original it compels a feverish push to the next page; it
feels so classically comfortable that the viewer can rest n the universe of their youth. The
result is something so rare, raw power. These books when holding them (I have all the Kirkham
covers though the variants are nice too) look like the cover art of the Weaponer will jump off
and throttle you; the collision with Sinestro is imminent and vicious. The detail on every
limb, on every page is surpassed only by the meticulous care paid to the facial expressions and
body positioning. There is a hint of Kirbyâ€™s showing the way and stealing the show, but
this is finely crafted, intensely refined art. Kirkham gives every panel the same respect and
takes no more account of a battle than a background. The shots of Qwardâ€™s panorama of
devastation and woe, Korugarâ€™s poverty or Oaâ€™s panicked beauty, are each
distinctly styled and separate from the other and no fudging or bleeding styles are apparent
anywhere in the entire run. In fact as far as pencils go, and I have had the pleasure of watching
Mr. Kirkham create in front of me at Comicfest in Denver briefly, no artist may include more
details to figures and landscape alike.





The figures themselves are icon defining versions, at least a few like Kyle, Sinestro and Guy.
When I picture them in my mind it is these versions I will see from now on. From
Sinestroâ€™s angular cruelty, so aptly represented in the narrow pupil-less eyes and
jutting cheekbones, to Guys blunt â€“ edged bloodlust symbolized by his bloated angry
face spitting blood in defiance Kirkham radiates emotion and generates interest with every
page. But Ganthetâ€™s secret steals the show and Kirkhamâ€™s pencils capture the
Guardian as sneaky and pious but not as a necessarily good being.

One thing above all else makes Kirkham the best GL artist in 10 years in my opinion and that can be
summed up in one word.

Scope. Tyler Kirkham understands the scope of the universe he is playing in better than any
artist to work in there since Van Sciverâ€™s Rebirth and maybe even since Gibbons. I know
a lot of fans of the Geoff Johns/Ivan Reis runs might disagree but I will stand by my evaluation
and present this image as proof.

Inks and Colors â€“ Matt â€�BATTâ€� Banning is better at bringing depth to
penciled work than any other inker in the business, and I do not mean physical
dimension(though that is exemplary) I mean infecting humanity. When paired with the eye for
color of Nei Ruffino, Battâ€™s inks become the atomic delivery system for the vibrant
energy that is the Green Lantern Corps. While Bedard and Kirkham set the pace fast and steady it
is Batt and Ruffino that restrain it. They are the ones who set mood in tone and shadow. This
finishes a most dynamic combination on a DC book in a long time, and none of the names are
Morrison or Johns.

Chemistry. That is why New Guardians is the bright spot in the DC Universe right now, blue hope
abounds.

Robin â€“ More than just a Sidekick By Rob Richardson



Jun 24

Posted by DAMM



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/robin-6.jpg?w=413&h=378

Iâ€™ve a plethora of favourite heroes across many comicsâ€™ franchises but for me
Robin is one of the most endearing and definitely one of the most enduring. Over the years the
character has had many incarnations and many personalities, with several young individuals
each bringing something different to the role of Batman â€™s partner in what became to be
known as the dynamic duo â€“ some were greeted more favourably than others. There have
been five canonical Robins in total; Dick Grayson , Jason Todd , Tim Drake , Stephanie Brown and
the current Robin, Damien Wayne .



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/robin5.jpg?w=480





Â 

Â 

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Robin was introduced to bring more young
readers to the Detective Comics book and was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. He debuted in
issue #38 in April 1940, to critical acclaim. He is often said to have been a
â€˜Watsonâ€™ to Batmanâ€™s â€˜Sherlockâ€™, adding, from a
creative stand point, someone for Batman to talk to and discuss narrative points with, thus
helping the reader follow the story and its detective logic. Robinâ€™s rather bizarre
costume was inspired by the medieval look of the hero of folk lore, Robin Hood, something that
has been echoed throughout its various styles â€“ in later years Damienâ€™s Robin
even had a brief period of wearing a hood.

This first Boy Wonder was Richard â€œDickâ€� Grayson, son of John and Mary; the
trapeze artists known as The Flying Graysons . A crime Boss called Zucco, who was extorting
money from the circus where the Graysons lived and profited, sabotaged their equipment
leading to the death of Dickâ€™s mother and father. Batman investigated the crime and
placed Dick under his care as alter-ego Bruce Wayne .

Â 

Â

Â 

Â Together they both shared a similar tragedy; as young children both had witnessed the
brutal murder of their parents. Batman saw in Dick Grayson a chance to channel the rage and
anger he had felt as a youngster and turn it into an avenging force for good and created the
superhero sidekick Robin. They went on to fight crime together for many years, forming a
father/son relationship, and becoming a force to be reckoned with on the streets of Gotham.

Â 

Â

Â 

He later went on to become one of the founding members of the Teen Titans and then to become
Nightwing, a role Dick held for many years. After the events that followed Final Crisis,
Gotham was left without a Batman. During the epic Battle for the Cowl, Nightwing had to reclaim
the city from a manic Jason Todd (Iâ€™ll come to him shortly), who was posing as Batman,
and then himself take up the Mantle of the Bat. This was a bold move on DCâ€™s part â€“
it seemed that for once characters were following natural progressions of their own. It was
right that Dick should have eventually have become Batman. He, in turn, gained a partner in the
form of Damien Wayne as Robin â€“ a whole different Robin from what we were used to might I
add. With the return of Bruce and the DC relaunch, it seems this Robin is set to return as
Nightwing in September but can currently be followed in the â€œBatman and Robinâ€�
title.Â 

Â 

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/robin4.jpg?w=480

Â 

Â 

Dick Grayson is the probably the most recognisable of the Robins and the one most referenced in
pop culture. Not only was he played by Burt Ward in the 1960â€™s Batman TV series
alongside Adam West as Batman but was also portrayed (perhaps not to great avail) by Chris
Oâ€™Donnell in Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Dick Grayson was voiced by Loren
Lester in the animated series of Batman. Although his costume was changed to look like that of
Tim Drakeâ€™s, he was Dick Grayson.

Â 

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/robin3.jpg?w=480

Â 

Â 

Â 

Jason Todd was the second young man to become Robin. His original back story was that of an
acrobat â€“ pretty similar to Dicks in all fairness (although Jasonâ€™s parents
were murdered by Killer Croc) â€“ but was changed after the events of Crisis on Infinite
Earths. Jason became a homeless orphan and was discovered by Batman as he tried to steal the
tires from the Batmobile. Rather than hand the child over to the authorities, Batman placed
Jason in care. The boy later helped Batman take care of a group of thieves (incredulous, I
know!) and was taken on as his new ward and the latest Robin.

Â 

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/robin2.jpg?w=480

Jason was much more headstrong than Dick had been and much more impudent towards Batman than
ever before. Readers didnâ€™t warm to him and in one of the most brutal moves â€“ but
brilliant for publicity and marketing â€“ DC gave them the option of killing the
character off. By a phone vote, the public voted â€˜yesâ€™ by a small margin (5,343
to 5,271) in favour of Jasonâ€™s death and he was murdered in the subsequent storyline, A
Death In The Family, by the Joker; bludgeoned to death by the psychopath with a crowbar and left
in a warehouse rigged to explode with a bomb. It really is quite savage and I would recommend any
comic book fan to read it.

Â 

Â 

Â 

Â 

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/damian.jpg?w=480

Â 

As is the world we love though, no one stays dead for long and Jason returned as the Red Hood
â€“ what many have established to be the Jokers original criminal persona â€“ and
was hell bent on revenge; not only on the Joker, but also to discredit and wound Batman as much as
possible. He later became a twisted version of Batman after the events of final crisis, one not
afraid to kill or torture his victims, until he was stopped by Dick Grayson. Jason was a true
victim of the worst trauma and has been expertly written since as a credible, damaged
individual. I have to say he has grown and grown in my eyes into an incredibly sinister and
cunning villain. He has all the training and knowledge of Robin but has gone over the edge, a
place where even Batman fears to go. Whenever I read him exchanges between him and the other
characters (see Batman: Under the Hood , Batman: Battle for the Cowl ) there is an electricity
in the air and a tension rarely captured by other villains.

Â 

Â 

Â 

Tim used his detective skills to uncover the Dynamic Duos secret identities after following
the appearance of the original Robin, Dick Grayson. Tim had been present at the murder of The
Flying Graysons and had followed the careers of Batman and Robin closely. With this
connection it was hoped to link the two Robins and not have the animosity connected to Jason
Todd. Batman was reluctant to accept Tim, still reeling himself from Jasonâ€™s death,
but was impressed by the boys deductive skills. He has said on later occasions the Tim could one
day become a greater detective than himself. Tim was a likeable Robin, and still is, he is not
too keen like Dick was in his day, nor is he arrogant and cocky like Jason. After the events of
Final Crisis and his failure to become the Batman during Battle for the Cowl, he set off on a
quest around the world in the guise of Red Robin to find any evidence that Bruce was not gone, or
if there was a way of bringing him back.

Tim was the first Robin to have his own title and after the re-launch looks set to be another
founding member of the new Teen Titans, much as he was a founder of Young Justice as Robin.

Â 

Stephanie Brown has been a fan favourite, firstly for becoming the Girl Wonder and secondly
for becoming Batgirl.

Stephanie took over from Tim following his resignation â€“ donâ€™t you hate it
when your girlfriend proves sheâ€™s better at the job than you are? She instigated a gang
war across Gotham to prove her worthiness to Batman and ended up being captured and tortured by
an insane Black Mask. She died due to the nature of the wounds but reappeared later â€“
Doctor Leslie Thompkins helped Stephanie fake her death until a time she was safe after the
gang war had subsided.

Stephanie has proved to be a very popular Batgirl since taking over from Cassandra Cain but
little is known of what is to happen in her future. DCâ€™s move to return Barbara Gordon to
the role has left fans guessing as to where, if any, Stephanieâ€™s place is in the future
of the DC Universe.

Â 

Bruce Wayne had a son and nobody knew? Donâ€™t worry; Bruce was as shocked as anyone.

Damien Wayne is the product of a union between Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, daughter of the
infamous Raâ€™s al Ghul. Damien was trained by the League of Assassins and intended to be
a vessel for the soul of his grandfather, eventually to be used to destroy the Dark Knight.
Batman prevented this and the boy was left in his care. Following the struggle of coming to
terms with his fatherâ€™s death, Damien was promoted to the role of Robin by Alfred
Pennyworth to save Tim from Jason during the Battle for the Cowl storyline. It looks however
that he will be reunited with his father after the DC relaunch as the pair take on the streets of
Gotham as the new Batman and Robin.

Â 

Â 

Â 

Damien is violent and lacks the discipline, ethics and sense of morality the other Robins have
had. He is an interesting character indeed. Could this be what may have happened to Bruce had he
stayed loyal to the League of Assassins? He makes a brilliant foil for Dick Graysons Batman;
the roles of the two have almost been reversed. Now Batman is the acrobat, the quite witted
dispatcher of one-liners and quips whilst Robin is the highly trained combatant, doing what
needs to be done to complete the job.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/robin0.jpg?w=480 Â 

Â 

What has always appealed to me about Robin, and I think has made the character a mainstay, has
been his ever evolving nature. No two Robins have ever been the same. The personalities of the
five have remained current to the times but they have also provided an excellent grounding for
their mentor. The creators of the characters have taken many risks along the route but nearly
all have paid off. Even the gamble of Jason Todd, his death and subsequent resurrection, has
produced an incredibly interesting, layered villain.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/robin-1990-1-pg00.jpg?w=480

I think, not only was Robin chosen as someone for Batman to train, teach and focus but I also
think the character was there to provide the view point of youth and innocence. Gotham is a dark
place and Batman is a dark personality, often treading a fine line between the evil and the
just. Robin is there to give him perspective, to rein him in and offer him the voice of the light
in such as dark place. It is only by listening to him that he maintains on a clear path. Look at
what happened to John Paul Valley (Batman: Knightfall) when he assumed the Mantle of the Bat
and ignored the help of Tim Drake. His fall from grace was only aided by his ignorance.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/robin-ii-01-00fc.jpg?w=480

What started out as character introduced to bring interest from a younger audience has grown
into an invaluable asset to Batman lore, integral to Batman as the Bat-mobile and the utility
belt.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/robin-iii-01-00fc.jpg?w=480

But this is only because Robin has proven him/herself. As Robin has shown by going off and
leading the Teen Titans, Young Justice and the Titans â€“ and then even becoming Batman
â€“ Robin is a strong a character as any DC has ever produced.

FIRE IN THE ASYLUM!! The Loose Ends Of Little Death



Jun 22

Posted by DAMM

The new sound is here you just donâ€™t know it yet and vagabond blast band Fire In The
Asylum are itâ€™s originators.

By DAMM

Â 

Â Â Â Â  In their sophomore effort Poetry for the Apocalypse , Fire in the Asylum has
done what few bands ever do. They have grown, bloomed and exploded to create an album vastly
superior to 2009â€™s self-titled debut. Not only that but they have blown the doors off
of genre and style and are ushering in what has to be called a new genre – Armageddon Blues. In
each of the 10 tracks FITA goes beyond the acute technical ability so readily displayed on the
debut and become a rolling Ragnarok of deep psyche, scarred emotion and brilliant
songwriting. If you were to take the Reverend Horton Heat , Nirvana, Stevie Ray Vaughn , Jimi
Hendrix threw them in a wood chipper and then sew them back together with the anger of the Sex
Pistols and the song crafting of Billy Joel you may get a mental visual of what this band has
done.

Â  The scathing indictments of the human soul embedded in the lyrics, rolling in
alternating groove melody and genuine pain of guitarist/singer Josh Phillips’ voice
leave lasting meaningful impressions and lingering self-question. Phillips is a world
class guitar player on par with the greats of metal AND blues but his greatest strength comes
from his ability to see the world in tempo and rhyme without losing anything in said
expression, drop it into an honest cauldron and poor out unsettling and relevant gold. His
voice has also improved in range and tone. It is ghostly, barbaric refined and melodic all at

Â  Joaquina â€œRoquiâ€� Lluma is absolutely fearless and brutally crisp; her
bass lines ricochet between the places left volatile and empty from the guitars only to roar
deep fiery life into skeletal beats lesser bass players leave barren and hollow. Graham
Marshall Mueller is the most consistently surprising and original drummers on mp3 today and
this is his finest work. While listening the strength of the grooves are overpoweringly body
moving and Mueller uses smooth flawless transitions that are very technical (rooted in Jazz)
but very appropriate to the songs feel. Thatâ€™s all well and good but not what it is. Not
really.

Â Â  Do you remember the first time you heard Nirvana? How about Tool? How about
Metallica? What about Red Hot Chili Peppers ? If you were alive and listening to music at all
those times you would probably agree that what all these have in common, at least to me it seems
this way, that the first time you heard those bands you knew you found something special
â€“ that what you were hearing was bigger than just the album you had on your headphones.
They were bands that connected the lost, united the angry and uplifted the disillusioned but
not as a note by note equation rather a perfect joining of elements and timing to make something
preposterous and infinitely valuable. It is called art. Rarely in music do we get it this pure .
Fire in the Asylum is about to turn the music world on its ear. Get on board now, or in July when
Poetry For The Apocalypse is officially released. It is like being at Warholâ€™s with
the Velvet Underground with more crunchy riffs and less pretentious single malt poets.

Â  Â 

The content on Poetry for the Apocalypse ranges all sides of real life from the eternal grind of
dead end jobs with no dreams in WageSlave (which has THE greatest guitar solo I have EVER heard
between the verses),

â€œI always get this feeling something just ain’t right

itâ€™s just the sickest sinking feeling trying to sleep at night.

So I wake up in the morning and I write

Â about it cuz i know its the only kind of relief I’m gonna get and I

……ask myself, when I pay up, who benefits from my labor?

When the ends don’t meet and I wind up in the streets….

trying to live in peace

you better wise up

do what the soul craves

make your mind up

don’t be a WageSlave!â€�

Â 

to the horrific but sweet euphoria of orgasmic intimacy in the opening track Little Death ,

â€� She didn’t have to say

she wanted me to hold her down

I knew she liked the pain

she wanted to be pushed around

I took her to the edge

and we both jumped off

and found a little death when she said OMG, thats gonna make me……â€�.

Â 

Other tracks like Calling You Out, Snafu and Holding You Back are eloquently raging at
authority figures that lie and steal or at the very least socially critical of punditry.
Holding You Back shouts,

Â â€œI pit my sarcastic wit against your petulant quips

and bury the spit that escapes from your lips

playing the fool and you look like an A-HOLE!

set yourself up for an epic fail

Â 

redlined, and ready to fly of the handle in the blink of an eye

you ain’t no ray of sunshine and its holding you back

redlined, and feeling the stress, no one knows what your gonna do next

you better learn to read the subtext, cuz its holding you backâ€�

But my personal favorites on this record are Circles, about the futility of insane behaviors
and the most catchy and moving song I have heard since A Perfect Circleâ€™s Three Libras
– Loose Ends .

Circles is a funk-metal/punk/blues fusion of systematic kick ass putting the world and other
bands on notice. With a tortured melody applied with a crowbar wrapped in mink, a mid-song
break where hauntingly Phillips sings

â€œits in the water, its in the air, its in the moment you turn out the lights

its in the water, its in the air, its in the moment you turn a blind eye.â€�

This is one of the best moments of my music listening life, and still is not as poignant and
powerful as Loose Ends a melodic web of overlapping technical wizardry and heart poetry
blasted from Phillips’ and Lluma ( think..perfectly blended) in a great display of
background vocal interplay. In Phillips greatest lyrical achievement less becomes more and
this beautiful thing happens,

â€œdreams decide what life that we live

end the night with nothing left to give

standing firm where most have fled, and following a trail of dead

move aside, doors are opening

Â 

I’m following a trail of loose ends

Â 

dreams decide what life that we live

bend the light, fill the void within

standing firm where most have fled, and following a trail of dead

philistines have walked ahead and plagiarized a life yet lived…

Â 

…..and I’m following a trail of loose endsâ€�

Â 

Â  Â 

Â 

There are someÂ  subtle detractions for this record in my opinion, the lack of background
vocals across the rest of the tracks is astonishing to me as when used – they are so effective.
Clearly there are other melodies in songs like Bottom Yet and Brutality that could use some
more (which I consider the weakestÂ  tracks on this endeavor.) There are sections on the
record that bleed into each and lose their distinction and as a result the songs suffer. These
are fine songs but along with Smoke Em Out they do not have the special fire or distinction so
glaringly brilliant in the other tracks.

Â 

All in all, if you miss this record early, do not worry. You were probably the guy playing with
pogs, listening to the Doors and Belinda Carlisle when Nirvana broke. But you caught up
didnâ€™t you? I am buying every music fan and friend one for holidays, birthdays and
events for the foreseeable future. Sorry Mom.

Green Lantern: The Dying of the Light Chapter 3 by co-moderator Rob Richardson



Jun 22

Posted by DAMM







*An Elseworlds Tale

Chapter 3

Ryut Rising

Â 

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/greenlantern-ring.jpg?w=480

Every time a Green Lantern dies, his or her ring ventures forth into the universe to seek out a
worthy replacement.

This was not the case today.

Something had stopped the process and it was something The Guardians of the Universe were not
aware of.

Someone was though.

When Sinestro had been banished to the anti-matter universe his restraints holding back the
demon Atrocitus had dissolved into the ether. Atrocitus, his hulking red form covered in
matted blood, dropped from the stinking cross and collapsed onto the floor. It took him an age
to collect himself but collect himself he did.

The first thing Atrocitus did was to rip a chunk of his own flesh from his forearm. He needed
meat. He was famished. Death had attempted to take on several occasions over the years but only
his resolve had stemmed its grasp. He had looked the scythe holding creature in the eye and
stated the fact that if it was to take him now it would forever be hunted by the spirit of Ryut
itself. A demon would never stop tracking the thing that had prevented its conquest; if Death
wanted to be that person then so be it.

Death said Atrocitus was destined for greater things and had spared him.

He crawled through the barren landscape with an increasing vigour. Sinestro
couldâ€™ve taken him anywhere. Abin Sur had him imprisoned on Ysmault but Sinestro
further taunted him by placing him on the decimated planet of his birth. This sector had been
â€˜cleansedâ€™ by the Manhunters, the first attempt at peacekeepers devised by
The Guardians. His wife and children had been burnt in laser fire, the lush vegetation and rich
civilization of this world burnt and torn up by androids masquerading as law enforcement
â€“ an entire sector punished for the crimes of the few.

Atrocitus had vowed to get revenge for the massacre by taking on The Guardians and their new,
improved protectors; the Green Lantern Corps . He and his brothers, the terrorist cell known
as The Five Inversions, had spread terror across the cosmos but had been captured for their
crimes. Ysmault had been an awful place, the walls absorbed the soul. Left there long enough
and you decayed into the planet but your soul remained within the rock, never to ascend to
whichever afterlife you believed in.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/atrocitus.jpg?w=480

Crucified in the ruins of your own home by a purple skinned bastard was far worse though.

Atrocitus crawled through soil and ash, leaving a trail of thick offal behind him. He knew he
was probably dragging himself through the remains of many loved ones but he had purpose now.

He reached the Amber Cathedral. It was shattered to nothing now. Only one wall remained. It
held a stained glass window which glittered with the images of many saints. Central to the
window was a leaded symbol; a circle with two lines in its centre curving outward at the top, a
smaller circle sat at the bottom. The circle within the circle. The soul. The family.

His family.

Atrocitus tore another pound of flesh from his other arm. This time he chewed upon it and spat it
onto the floor. He stirred a claw into it, the pain tearing into his arm.

â€œI bring myself and my rage.â€� He screamed towards the glass. â€œThe rage of
a billion souls, of countless lives wasted!â€�

There was a tremor and the glass blew out from remaining cathedral wall. Atrocitus shielded
his face; blood splattered his cheeks, glass shards spearing his flesh. He felt the sudden
presence of an immense heat across his skin.

When he uncovered his eyes what he saw terrified even him.

The Butcher stood before him. A huge bull, with horns turned both towards the sky and into the
ground, an immense ring through its nose, breathed flame over his skin. It was ethereal,
composed entirely of the red light of rage. It spoke to him through his mind. The two were
completely in tune.

â€œYou are a being of pure rage Atrocitus, of which the whole galaxy should beware of your
reckoning.â€� The Butcher spoke, its voice deep and terrible.

â€œI wish not only for revenge, my lord. I wish for retribution, justice for my
people.â€� Atrocitus rose onto a bent knee before the huge bovine. â€œI wish to
serve.â€�

â€œYour suffering alone proves this, Lost Soul .â€� The Butcher grunted and
stomped the earth, as if tethered to something unseen. â€œI have not long.â€�

The Butcher directed thoughts into Atrocitusâ€™ mind. The beast had used its power to
affect the Central Power Battery with another, unseen ally. The Green Lantern power rings
could no longer find a replacement; once their wielder had died, the ring would fail and become
useless. Atrocitus was to hunt down these Green Lanterns and kill as many as he could and do it in
the name of The Butcher.

The demon bull wrenched once more and exploded into nothingness.

Where it has stood Atrocitus saw a small, shining object in the dust.

A red power ring.

He smiled and thought back to his first two targets. One would be a hindrance and one would help
but The Butcher had been vague as to which.

One was a being known only as Rosetta.

The other a human.

GUNS ABLAZINâ€™: BLINDSIDED By Mat Nastos



Jun 22

Posted by DAMM





 

Warp graphics alum, writer/director and all around get it done guy tells me about the
contagious passion that is Marat Mychaelsâ€™ Blindside

article and interview by DAMM

Â 

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bs2.jpg?w=480



Â 

Mat Nastos has been making an impact since he started in comics, and in January he hopes to do it
again. The Elfquest legend has been recruited by Marat Mychaels to pen the Blindside
Kickstarter Project and couldnâ€™t be happier. The writer/director, self-publisher
of Cadre through his own Nifty Comics back in 1996, Elfsong and his involvement in over 75 films
make him a great choice for the job. Not only does he have the chops but the passion, and when
working on a Creator-Owned baby funded by fans like Mychaelsâ€™ Blindside, passion is
the name of the game.

Blindside, for those who may not know, is an ex-secret agent for the Orion Sector who is forced
to wear briefly the Medusa Helmet â€“ a weapon made for a villain Ronald Quinn who
subsequently frames him for the murder of the inventor of the helmet. As time progresses we see
the helmet has given him the ability to see through objects, night vision, enhanced reflexes
and some invulnerability. Now he needs to clear his name.Â  And blow things up. And Shoot
stuff in the name of Justice. Now whether this is still the origin time will tell but Mat Nastos
has had some great ideas before. I asked him some questions on another topic and he replied very
graciously (stay tuned for more on this) then inevetibly, fan to fan Blindside came up. So I
asked him some questions. He answered again. Cool.



Image:
http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/mat_nastos-film_sensei.jpg?w=480 Â 

1. Tell us about Blindside, who he is and where he came from, for the readers who are unfamiliar
– why bring him back do you think today’s readers may find him more appealing and/or
marketable today than 15 years ago?



MN -Blindside was created by Marat Mychaels about 15 years ago, back when he was one of the key
artists with Extreme Studios at Image Comics .Â  This is me totally speaking for Marat here,
but he was inspired by all of the hardcore, street level action superheroes that our
generation grew up loving — Daredevil, Spider-man, Deadpool, Deathstroke, even
Nightwing.Â  Characters full of action, highly acrobatic and ready to kick some ass.

http://www.matnastos.net/

The character appeared in his own comic from Image back in the late 90s and then went on to make a
few appearances here and there.Â  Unfortunately for those of us who were fans of Blindside,
Marat was called away to work on other books and his creator owned project was left behind.

The funny thing is, to this day, I hear people talking about their love for that single issue of
Blindside that Image put out.Â  I hear it from fans and other professionals alike!Â 
It’s crazy how much love there still is for this character who only appeared in a couple of
comics.Â  That everlasting love is a testament for the incredibly iconic design Marat came
up with for Blindside, along with some pretty killed action sequences in Blindside #1.Â 
When I mention to people that I’m writing a new Blindside series for Marat, almost every
single one brings up his cool design and the amazing action sequence that was the tent-pole
piece in the comic.

As to why we’re bringing him back after 15 years and why people will find him more
appealing?Â  That’s simple: hardcore action.Â  Marat and I have very similar tastes
in comics and movies, which was something that clicked between us when we met.Â  We both love
John Woo movies, Tango & Cash , Michael Bay and Quentin Tarantino films.Â  And, as we talked,
we agreed that one of the things that was missing from modern comics was action and excitement.

Let’s face it, for the past 10 years or so, talking head comics and photo-realistic art has
dominated the industry.Â  And, that stuff is great.Â  However, along the way, as the art
became more and more realistic, comics started to look like very pretty, very boring
movies.Â  No longer did we see over-the-top action.

After finishing up a run on Deadpool Corps for Marvel, Marat mentioned to me that he was going to
bring Blindside back and that the wanted to make it a testosterone-filled comic made for guys
like us. That’s all I needed to hear — I was in.

That’s what Blindside is going to be: a comic with a lot of balls and no excuses, and I think
fans are going to dig it.



2. Tell us why Blindside has such a dear place for you and how you got involved with Blindside
Kickstarter project. Did the desire to do it “your way” make Kickstarter the preferable
way of approaching it?





Image:
http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/blindside-marat_mychaels.jpg?w=480

This is really more of a question for Marat to answer.Â  I can go over why I wanted to be
involved.

What it comes down to is that I am a fan of the character, a fan of Marat’s spectacular artwork
and a fan of hardcore action.Â  This book brings three things I love together and mashes them
all up.Â  I had already written (and directed) a couple of high action films for the SyFy
Channel and this was a great excuse for me to do the same thing with comics.

As for Kickstart, I know that Marat is dedicated 5+ months of his life to get Blindside
drawn.Â  He’s not taking any other gigs and isn’t taking a dime from Kickstarter for
himself.Â  This is an all-in bet for his career.Â  As well as being an amazing artist,
Marat is also a pretty smart cat.Â  To compete with the big boys of comics, he knew he had to
hire the best people around to help do the jobs he can’t do himself — things like high end
coloring and lettering.Â  He also knew he would need to have covers done by some of the
absolute best artists around — guys like J Scott Campbell , Rob Liefeld , Ethan Van Sciver and
a couple of others that haven’t been announced yet.Â  And to get those guys, to give
Blindside the best possible chance to succeed, Marat knew he was going to need to pay for them.

That’s what Kickstarter does for a project like this: helps to give it a fighting chance in an
incredibly tough industry.



3. Will Image (original publisher) pick this book up once it reaches full production from fan
support or will the book be self-published?

Â 

Nothing has been signed yet, but I do know that Marat will approach Image about publishing once
he gets the first couple of issues drawn and colored.Â  Before that point, there’s really
not much need to get a publisher lined up.Â  I, for one, would love to see Blindside return to
the company that originally published his adventures.Â  What would be cooler than that
after 15 years away?Â  It’d also be a nice push to have Blindside taking part of the Image 20
year anniversary next year.Â  Marat was there with Image at the beginning and it’d be
awesome to see him as still a part of it 20 years later.

I also wanted to say that Marat and I are both completely dedicated to Blindside.Â  We’re
both giving it 110% and we’re going to have all 4 issues completed before the first issue is
solicited in October (we’re aiming for a January 2012 release to coincide with the start of
the Image 20th Anniversary).Â  You just don’t hear about that kind of dedication to a
project — when was the last time even a Marvel or DC book had every issue finished before
solicitation?Â  Never as far as I know!



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bs1.jpg?w=480 Â 

Â 





4.Will there be familiar villains and supporting cast or only all new characters?



Blindside is going to pick up two years after the original issue.Â  You’re going to see
some familiar faces in terms of the supporting cast, but we’re loading it to the gills with
new bad guys for Blindside to face.Â  One of the villains Marat designed is easily one of the
coolest, most bad-ass characters I’ve ever seen in a comic, film or video game.Â  I
don’t want to give too much away, so I’ll just say this: chainsaw katana .



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bs8.jpg?w=480

The cool thing about the new series is that it will be completely accessible for new readers —
you won’t have to have read any of Blindside’s original appearances in either the
original Blindside #1 or Asylum.Â  Everything you need to know is right there in the first
issue, along with some of the most intense action I’ve ever seen in a comic book.Â  If you
are an old school Blindside fan, tho, there will be a ton of extra things for you to pick up on.

As I mentioned above, there are going to be some killer variant covers by some of the hottest
artists around — Van Sciver, Liefeld and Campbell are just the tip of the iceberg!

This thing is going to blow people away.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bs6.jpg?w=485&h=750

For anyone interested, Marat has made a digital copy of the original Blindside #1 comic
available for free on his website.Â  Just jump over to
http://www.maratmychaels.com/BSorigin.pdf and check it out.Â  While you are there, you
can check out more of the new Blindside artwork.Â  There is also a pretty active Blindside
fan page on Facebook at:
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Blindside-the-comic-book-fan-page/106564779428090

If you’re on Twitter, you can follow Marat at @MaratMychaels or my at @NiftyMat for constant
updates, sneak peeks at art and more.

Check out Blindside in 2012 because we’re bringing it!

Captain America Corps # 1

Marvel $2.99

(Roger Stern/Philippe Briones/Matt Milla/Cory Petit with covers by Jimenez and Brown)



Image:
http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cac_1_oroboros_cps_001.jpg?w=480 Â 



Captain Americas from various times are assembled by the mysterious cosmic entity Tath Ki to
prevent the frozen bodies of the other Captain Americas from disappearing across the various
timelines and to discover why this is happening. Captain America Steve Rogers pre-Bucky,
Captain America Bucky Barnes , U.S. Agent John Walker, Shannon Carter the Captain America of
the next generation and Kioshi Morales the future Commander of the Americas become the
Captain America Corps. Sent to the future they see an America of Fascism and controlled
citizens where masks are illegal unless authorized. They are systematically and as you
guessed a mile away hassled and hunted, wait for it, by the Ameridroid. Sigh. The 20 foot high
Captain America Sentinel/Android that seems to be the enforcer in the dystopian Rogers body
free future.

First letâ€™s talk about the good. The art is stellar; the way each Cap stands distinctly
on their own in costume and stature is because of the great care Briones takes to personify
them. Even the 2 Caps we do not care about, (in my case especially the New World Order United
Americas Cap, which would not sneak past me in Superman nor will it here) become stand outs on
the page. He draws the Captain America Corps with distinct features and expressions where the
easy thing to do is let them all be the mask with hair. When the action starts though, the art
rapidly loses pacing and immediacy but I believe this as much the fault of concept, poor
plotting and tired, rehashed time spanning concept.





Â  Let me go on record here, I LOVE Roger Sternâ€™s work, nearly all he has ever written.
I consider his time on Superman some of the most crucial and valuable. Spider-Man :
Deadmanâ€™s Hand, HobGoblin Lives and Revenge of the Green Goblin are Spider-Man
defining stories not to mention the Life and Death of /Never Ending Battle books.

Â 

This just misses so badly it actually feels like a suit wrote it in the Marvel Films marketing
dept.

Â This is marketing department garbage. â€œHey we got a movie coming out letâ€™s
slap Cap on a bunch of horrible stories and move them out!â€� seems to scream from this
book.

Â 

If you read the above synopsis and kept a straight face perhaps you arenâ€™t familiar
with the Spider-Man TAS episodes where Spidey has to recruit alternate timeline versions of
himself including Scarlet Spider (ugh) to rescue himself from the incarnation
Spider-Carnage (ugh again) who eventually is â€œUncle Ben talkedâ€� into giving
up crime. The episodes in question â€œ Spider-Wars â€� were the series finale shark
jump. In Captain America Corps it is the whole premise.

Â The similarities in the first issue of CAC to these episodes struck me constantly and the
dialogue is atrocious except for one really well written speech given by Steve Rogers. Tath Ki
is unapproachable and unconvincing; the appearance of the Watcher did nothing to give a sense
of urgency and was rather uninspired. Â With the movie media blitz and soon to be several
other Captain America appearing titles, this is not even a choice I can make twice. In this age
of reboots, re-launches and character kills a weak effort in a debut issue does not warrant a
repeat purchase. All that plus there is an energy shield (ugh infinitum.)

CONAN: Island of No Return #1

Dark Horse $3.50

(Ron Marz/ Bart Sears /Randy Elliot/Troy Peteri)

Â 



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/conan_01_001.jpg?w=480

Â 

Conan the Barbarian is running for his life in the last great city of Aquilonia, Tarantia ,
sword helm and clothes in hand, after being caught with the judgeâ€™s wife in his own bed.
A naked Conan swordfights on rooftops runs and jumps through merchant tents and is finally
pulled to safety by two mysterious women. We get their origin tale over a campfire and strike
out with no wasted time, by boat. These women are thieves and are recruiting for the ultimate
score. On an Island, rumored to be haunted lies a massive fortune in treasure and the women
â€“ Brenna and Venya are half-sisters â€“need the savage Conan to cloimb the
cliffs and get them the access needed to the castle at the top. This island is dangerous, hope he
returns. Once at the top there is an ominous presence leaving the setup for next issue.

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/conan_01_010.jpg?w=480







First letâ€™s talk about the good. There is a lot of it. In Conan stories there is
something more important than scantily clad women, wine orgies and bloodbaths (which seems
possible too) it is the background art and silent plotting that carries a Conan comic book.
From the first page there is a success in that. It FEELS like Conan before you get one good look at
his characterization. Bart Sears is on top of his game and is leading the way in the return to the
exaggerated body detail and sizing of the 90â€™s, more homage than duplication though
as it is appropriate and beautiful to view. The sinews and tendons on his human anatomies are
really detailed, but his animals, marketplace, stables, oceans, and the castle at the end of
issue #1 make the world work.



Â Â  Â So many Conan comics in the past have tried to jump right into swords and blood a
foot deep before ever letting the reader enjoy the fact he has entered the Hyborian Kingdoms
steeped in treachery and adventure, sand and magic. This team, in particularly the art team,
has not let that happen this time. In this first issue the world of Hyborea is the star, as it
should be. The carefully placed silhouettes in and around the panels give an ephemeral
watcher viewpoint and without question the right place to be when immersed in Conan, and are
relevant and on one page eerily poignant (pg. 18.) This point alone makes me very hopeful for
this 4 issue arc. Marz starts a very solid straightforward questing tale, highlighted by a far
more likeable Conan than in recent memory. The pace is brisk and there is plenty of action for
swordplay junkies and adventurers.

Â

There are a few flaws though. Foremost was the one art flaw. Facial expressions frozen in place
on the devolved brow of our hero by the sheer amount of muscle and bone protrusions caused a lack
of emotive context for the dialogue, which you DO eventually pick up on. There is also a real
sense of no real surprises which is common with the debut issue of an adventure because setup is
so necessary. I also am not crazy about the half-sister characters yet. They seem flat but this
may be because of the above mentioned facial expression issue. There is also the places where
the story feels like there are gaps in pace if not content. But I suppose in 4 issues you have to
remove anything even remotely verbose. All in all I will purchase Conan: Island of No Return #2
to follow this stunning book.

That Hellbound Train #1

Â 

At midnight in every train yard there is the midnight Hellbound Train, the train that takes
railway men off to hell. This is the one of first lessons young Martin learns abut trains. After
he is orphaned by That Hellbound Train yung Martinâ€™s life becomes a hell of its own in
the Bloch Orphanage as a victim of bullying and misery, then flailing from job to job, riding
boxcars and then one day he gives up. He wishes for the Hellbound Train and it comes. The
â€œConductorâ€� begrudgingly accepts a deal Martin forces on him. He will go on the
train but he gets the ability to stop time forever â€“ one shot at irreversible
immortality and thus, not die so the Martinâ€™s soul will remain safe. The game is afoot
now and Martin goes to make his fortune.

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/tht-10.jpg?w=480



Again letâ€™s talk about the good first; there is so much of the good in this book. The art
is a perfect balance of the historically dark and radically abstract. It delves hauntingly
into a western ghost story feel told with a turn of the 20 th century industrial sensibility.
This really helps flesh out the personality of our protagonist. The kitchen, the boxcar and
the orchard build believable barriers to contain the star of this book. The train is visually
flawless and coloring on this book stands out with a real intensity. Though not as bright as
cape titles or the shine of DCâ€™s Jonah Hex books the flat earthy scene tones mixed with
the sharp contrasting hues of face and gore.

Â 

Out of all the books from last week I read for review this one I feel I enjoyed the most.
Especially out of the 5 or 6 horror comics I read (Although Scott Snyderâ€™s American
Vampire Survival of the Fittest was a close second!). There are not many flaws if any. I can pick
nits about how in places the lettering was hard to read and slowed my progress a little. Also I
wanted more splash pages, but that is because the ones in it are so good. Is that really a
complaint? Probably not. This feels like Twilight Zone meets Bradbury in tone to me.You bet
your sweet Aunt Petunias potato salad I am getting the rest of this series. I recommend it.







Review That!

Reviews Not From Last Week

Brian and Bobbi GN

215ink $9.99

(Wilson/Viglino)





Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/dec101071.jpg?w=480



Â 

Bobbi is the daughter of city superhero The 329, a powerful telekinetic who split when
informed of her existence. Since then her mother has been convinced she is destined for
greatness, so nothing is ever Bobbiâ€™s fault. Her mom even does her homework for her.
Unlike Brian who can fly and no one believes or can see him do it. His bachelor pad and record
store job make a nice life but Brian has always known he had super powers. Why canâ€™t
anyone see? But Bobbi can, and she wants to know how he can fly. Bobbi is also tenacious,
determined and a little creepy to get her answers. The answers they find are that of young
people getting to know each other and finding that one person you can trust. More powers are
revealed and the inevitable transformation to hero is completed when Bobbi takes it on
herself to show Brian the ropes. With the help of her outfitter friend in the city Brian defeats
the giant robots of the recently escaped Dr. Synapse â€“ the 329â€™s arch villain.
The rest of this story canâ€™t be told without spoiling the touching poignancy of the
real life (for a superhero) ending in this book and the parts of growing up that can suck but what
makes life worth it too.

Â 

Fans of Scott Pilgrim should run to this superior book in droves. While in a black and white
novella format this book is colorful. It is vibrant in the mind. It is full of hope and light in
the face of the mundane that is reminiscent of the most well written and history defining
Spider-Man stories, where Peter is still that light when the world says all is lost. Among the
memorable artistic moments in this book are several moments where the power of flight comes
through and it is freeing. In so many cape books we take for granted, as well as the artist, how
cool flying would be. Brian and Bobbi reminded me.

The detractions are the normal ones you would expect for a new publisher, budget, resources
and circulation at times shows. One can hardly fault them for it.

Â I highly recommend this fledgling company and this GN. Hopefully more from Brian and
Bobbi will appear.

X-Men Legacy #250

Marvel $4.99

(Mike Carey/Khoi Pham/Tom Palmer/Marte Garcia/Steve Kurth/Jay Leisten/Brian Reber) + A
Classic New Mutants Reprint of Into the Abyssby Chris Claremont/ Bill
Sienkiewicz/Orz/Glynis and Jim Shooter

Â 



Â 

This issue was released June 8th 2011

Xavier has a problem. When Xavier has a problem it is never a good thing. The current problem is
that after having their memories and minds messed with for a week Charlesâ€™ son David
Haller the mutant Legion is missing 6 of his super powered personalities. These multiple
personalities have escaped Legionâ€™s physical body and the need to track them down
before they warp all reality and/or kill people. Each of these personas have a name â€“
Endgame, Susan in Sunshine, Chain, Time Sink, Bleeding Image and the worst of them all Styx.
Before Charles can act however he must consult the new supreme commander of the X-Men and their
island Cyclops (who is a d*#k more than ever. Sorry I NEVER liked this guy and since he has been in
charge his attitude sucks too) who allows Rogue and Gambit to go with himself and Legion. As
they make for the plane Rogue suddenly takes off to see Rachel Summers who is dissipating. The
whole second story by Carey/Kurth is about this conversation. As the team gets to the plane it
is revealed that Magneto was ORDERED by Cyclops (again, who does Summers think he is? I hope
Wolverine hands him his ass in Schism) to accompany them and is basically in right in the
professorâ€™s grill. Also on board the X-Jet is Cargill the ex-Acolyte terrorist now
trying for reformation. Rogue returns and the team go after Time Sink. As a Backup a reprinting
of the New Mutants story Into the Abyss retells Legionâ€™s first appearance in New
Mutants #25.

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/xl_250_012.jpg?w=480



X-Men Legacy has been the best X-Book in the stable for a while now and this anniversary issues
delivers in a couple of big ways. Â First we find out where Rachel Summers body has been and
where she goes. Second the exploration of Legionâ€™s powers get better and better and
there is no finer display to date of how cool this character is than the battle between the X-Men
Legacy team and Time Sink. This is the best X-team I have seen in recent memoryâ€Šmaybe
ever. Â The pave is here, the urgency is here and the threat enough to warrant such a team of
heavyweights. I have been saying that Marvel has been careful and responsible with slowly and
meticulously fixing continuity with writing and here are several examples in this book,
first the interaction with Chuck and Mags is written here as cool even as a rivalry again
leading the way to restore the all-out animosity they have built over the years, to come out and
set the relationship as it should be â€“ contentious, personal and out of control. Never
needing a world collapsing reboot to do it, the creative teams on the X-Books are fixing what
others before them have broken. It will take time, but continuity WILL be preserved and the
X-Universe will be right again. This is the right way.

Â 

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/xl_250_020.jpg?w=480



X-Men Legacy is one of the brightest and shiniest books on the market and is a glory to behold.
Each page is a whoop-ass lesson in characterization and history, all the years of it, without
losing the freshness or striking action eye candy.. Pham understands that the key to the X-Men
is in their illustrated personas (facial expressions that the character would have not just
the necessary expression called for by the script, the facial expression fits what we know
from 50 + years of X-Men) not only their scripted characterizations (those that fit plot
device and are written intentionally to propel the plot. X-Men Legacy is the shining gem in the
X-Universe right now but it still has a lot of the problems the other X-Titles do â€“
Â convoluted continuity in relation to the rest of the Marvel U and too many connected plots
â€“ these are staples of X-Men but they have become to big for even die hard convoluted
plot readers like myself to follow. Which is what Schism and Dark Angel is supposed to help do.
As anniversary books from Marvel go this is better than most. Carey is handling these
characters well and is writing in his best strides. The backup reprinting is a nice touch but
more original story or even a relevant present day side story would have been preferable. I
will keep buying this book. I love the X-Men.

SKULL KICKERS #8

A preview By DAMM



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/skullkick8.jpg?w=480



On June 29 th the eighth issue of Skull Kickers, Imageâ€™s stellar fantasy series about
mercenary monster hunters hits LCS shelves. This book is brought to you by Jim Zubkavitch,
Edwin Huang and Misty Coats. For my review and full description of Skill Kickers you can go
here.


http://www.worldofsuperheroes.com/comics/in-their-own-image-why-summer-and-fall-is-about-more-than-reboots-and-schisms/

Then go get every issue you can.





It took 7 issues before we learned our heroesâ€™ names (no I am not going to tell you,
itâ€™ll spoil the surprise), and how they came to be called Skull Kickers (No again.) But
when we last left them at the end of the most hilarious massacre I have ever seen, they were
wanted for the misunderstanding. Topping issue #7 was going to be hard but that was only part
one of the â€œFive Funerals & a Bucket of Blood â€� storyline. Issue eight opens
where you would expect, our heroes dressed in their fancy pants hiding from a town swearing
vengeance on them. Fairies are monsters too. What do they do? Emergency Council Meeting that
is what! So to clear their names and make their glowing framers pay the Skull Kickers hatch a
plan.

The laughs continue through this book; I am still amazed at how it is the art driving the plot so
the dialogue entertaining us along the way. This dynamic makes so much possible on the page
including the word gags in the back ground action cues. If you have not checked out Skull
Kickers you may not realize how fun comics are right now. An example here is the scene where the
local constabulary tries to confiscate our large friendâ€™s gun. They have never seen a
gun, let alone gold one. They call it the â€œlittle golden hammerâ€� and they need
reinforcements. I laughed out loud scaring everyone in the room at the coffee house, but
unable to keep from giggling like a hyena on nitrous oxide . Such is the nature of the book. We
learn how to contact a thieves guild, through a fantastically drawn hand to hand battle and
into a scene featuring the greatest cleaning lady in comics history. I would buy a book about
her even. But what happen when the head of the thieves guild is undead? Well you fight the giant
monster. â€œNot a speck of mustard to hide the tasteâ€� A steal at $2.99

Extensive Graphic Novel Rental Section



Â Retailoring Retail:

Jason S. Blanchard, Co-Owner of A Comic Shop near Orlando, may save comic stores by the dozen
with a revolutionary new program he has developed and is using with tremendous success. In a
WOS exclusive he tells the rest of the comic retail industry his secret in hopes of making the
Local Comic Shop more profitable with the Graphic Novel Rental program.

When I first asked him to share the details of this program with me I feel he was initially
hesitant. Rightly so, Mr. Blanchard is a very good businessman. I have followed him on Twitter
during Tuesdayâ€™s #comicmarket hashtag ( everyone should get on this btw)
discussions enough to know he gets the numbers very well, but what I had to point out is he never
settles for the status quo. He honestly believes we have not yet begun to fight for the LCS side
of comics and his Graphic Novel Rental Program proves it.

Now, I am a loudmouth columnist and an avid fan, a reader of the first order and bean counting
continuity nut, but I am no retailer and I do not get the numbers. Not all of them anyway. So I just
interviewed him via email and asked him to tell us how it works and why he is telling.

Â 

Â 

DAMM - I recently saw on twitter that you have a Graphic Novel Rental program in store, and the
idea intrigued me. Tell us how the program works?



JSB – You are the only person whoâ€™s ever gotten an in-depth explanation of how the
rental program works outside of the shop. We normally keep it a little secret, so we can explain
it in the shop, but now I want other shops to start using it and adapting it, so thanks for
covering it.

Â The economy doesnâ€™t seem to be getting any better and with hopefully lots of new
people coming into shop for the DC Re-launch, this can help other retailers prepare for NEW
FANS !!!

Â 

Here is the pitch we have in the shop.

Â 

You can rent over 2,000 graphic novels for 70% – 85% off the cover price. You can essentially
read 3-4 graphic novels for the price of one.

Â 

Here is how it works; you purchase a $20 rental card from us, that has a $10 refundable deposit.
When you decide you donâ€™t want to rent anymore, bring the card back and weâ€™ll
give you the $10. Or, if you lose a graphic novel, or it is damaged, the $10 will reimburse us for
the book. The card also comes with 10 POINTS; you can use those POINTS to start renting graphic
novels right now.

Â 

Here is how the POINTS work. The entire rental program works on a POINT SYSTEM. Each book has a
POINT VALUE that is the equivalent to being 70%-75% off the cover price. There are 2 ways to get
POINTS for your card to be able to rent.

Â 

1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  You can trade in the graphic novels you currently own for
POINTS. You will get POINTS based on the cover prices of the book you are trading into the
program. The book you trade in will then join the program and someone else will be able to rent it
in the future.

2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  You can buy points. $5 = 6 POINTS, or $20 = 30 POINTS, that is why
when you rent a book, itâ€™s between 70%-85% off the cover price, depending on how you
bought your POINTS.

Â 

So, if you trade in 5 graphic novels, you could get 30+ POINTS for them, and now you are reading
anything you want in the program until your points run out. Then you could either trade in more
graphic novels or purchase more POINTS as you need them.

Â 

Note: No graphic novel is put into the program by us, all the books available for rent were
traded in by the users of the rental program.

Â 

The other reason the program is cool is because, any book you rent, and love, and want to own for
the rest of your life, you can buy a BRAND NEW copy of the book and weâ€™ll take 30% off the
cover price. So, the program is also a great try-before-you-buy program.

Â

Â 





DAMM- I know that as a business making money is important, even (gasp!) profits. Can you tell me
why this program is not counterproductive to these ideas?

Â 

A majority of our customers are brand new to comics. We outreach nonstop to anyone who will
listen to us talk about how much we love comics and think they will too.

Â Watch video to see our approach to running â€œA COMIC SHOPâ€�

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we1rDzX8OCc

(DAMMâ€™S NOTE â€“ this video is also an indication of Blanchard and
Haalandâ€™s new ideas with old business sense are working )

To a brand new comic fan, the price of comics and graphic novels, and the fact that story keeps
going on and on, can be a huge barrier to them even trying comics.

Â 

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/dsc_1692.jpg?w=480



Jason S. Blanchard Co-Owner and Producer

Â 

The rental program allows them a low-cost entry into the stories they might really like.

Â 

The MATH!

Â 

A graphic novel makes a profit for the comic shop by the 2 nd time itâ€™s been rented. The 3
rd time and every time after that, the book is making a profit for the shop. Which helps us break
through the very small margins of selling comics and graphic novels.

Â 

We then can have the capital we need to do marketing & advertising, throw parties, fly creators
to the shops for signings and more parties, go big on the books we believe in, and anything else
we can do to improve the shop for the customers.

Â 

The other reason itâ€™s profitable and makes sense.

Â 

When BLACKEST NIGHT started coming out and it was awesome, or THE DEATH OF SPIDER-MAN, or any
other major storyline comes out, some regulars want to get in, but they also want everything
that came before it. The rental program lets people get caught up. We learned over time, that we
started selling more of the single issues once people were current on a series.

Â 

When someone comes into the shop and they get Walking Dead, Vol. 1, it may take them a long time to
be able to afford all 14 volumes, but if they rent it, it will only cost them 30% of what it would
have cost and they can read it faster and get caught up quicker. Now, they can read Invincible,
XXXombies, Marvel Zombies, and anything else they might enjoy.

Â 

Weâ€™ve also learned that renters visit the shop 2-3 times more than a casual or even
weekly or bi-weekly regular. Why? Because you can only rent one book at a time. If people want to
rent more than once, they have to wait till theyâ€™ve been renting for awhile, and we
trust they will return with the books, then they can upgrade their status for a onetime $10 fee.





DAMM – Is this program in theory to go as a “along with” as opposed to “instead of”
collecting?

Â 



Â 

When we first started the shop and weâ€™d do outreach and ask people â€œdo you read
comics,â€� they would say, â€œNo, I do not collect comics.â€� Then we would
say â€œI didnâ€™t ask if you collect comics, do you read comics.â€�

Most people donâ€™t want to start buying comics, because they donâ€™t want to
collect. The one thing Iâ€™ve learn from hearing about all the illegal downloads of
comics is that those people just want to read the story; they donâ€™t care about
collecting anything.

If there are so many people willing to just read the stories, then we should search for people
who just want to read comics. The rental program allows people to just read the stories, enjoy
the stories, and do it for a lot less money.

Renters are a new type of comic fan.





DAMM – What have been the biggest obstacles to implementing the program? Has interest been
high/participation? If so has it hurt the other aspects of your store or has the overall income
increased because of it?





Â 

The biggest obstacles are the Technology issues and explaining the program, itâ€™s a
little complicated and such a unique concept. There is no software available for a rental
program for graphic novels, so we had to take different pieces of technology and piece them
together to make the program work.



Sales have increased because the program.



We launched the program in the heart of the recession (Feb 2009). It gave people who were losing
their jobs or were wary about spending their money on comics and graphic novels a chance to keep
reading, by either trading in their old graphic novels, or having a low-cost alternative to
paying full price for their favorite stories.



DAMM – What does this program do to your space, and displays as the inventory grows and
shrinks? Do you think it makes you more conscious of the layout and marketing? Does it matter at
all? Do you think this program can work elsewhere as effectively or is your market geared for it
by location i.e. Seattle vs. Miami markets?

Â 

We devote 30â€™ of wall space to the program, but almost every graphic novel has a full
facing, instead of being â€œspine-out.â€� You could do it in a lot less space if you
wanted to. It works best in an area where you can outreach to new comic fans or lapsed comic fans.
We are located across the street from Full Sail University, and between Rollins College and
the University of Central Florida. The program is great for college students, because they
are reading at a discounted rate, and when itâ€™s time to graduate and move, they
donâ€™t have a huge collection they have to transport with them.

Â 

Would it work in other areas? Yes, it would have to be adapted. In Seattle, with limited space,
maybe only have your TOP 10 graphic novels available for rent.

Â 

The most important thing for any retailer to know if they want to try this is that it has to be
rolled out in stages.

Â 

STAGE 1. Let people know theyâ€™ll be able to rent in the future, and to bring in their old
graphic novels to get POINTS to read the other books in the program essentially for free.

Â 

STAGE 2. You start collecting everyoneâ€™s trade-ins. Then you put the POINT sticker on
the book, a unique & new BAR CODE, and enter the book into a point-of-sales system or some other
way youâ€™re going to track the book.

Â 

STAGE 3. Sell the rental card and allow people to start renting.

Â 

The reason it has to be rolled out in the stages is because no one wants to become a renter if there
are no books to rent. Also, as a retailer, you canâ€™t afford to buy a couple hundred books
to seed the program, so it works best if your early adopters are the ones who bring in all the
titles.

Â 

If there is any retailer who would like to know more, I am available on twitter @jasonacs or by
email Jason (at) acomicshop.com

Â 

BOTTOM LINE: We have proven for over 2 years that this program works, is profitable, and
appeals to regulars and a new kind of comic fan. Itâ€™s cheaper than buying comics
digitally and itâ€™s a way for fans to try new titles with a lot less risk to their wallets.

Â 

DAMM – Thanks for taking the time to answer these questions and explain to the universe your
great idea.

Green Lantern: Robâ€™s Review



Jun 18

Posted by DAMM



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/hal-jordan1.jpg?w=480



Â by Rob “I’m in the CORPS!”Â  Richardson



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I queued up for my ticket with my brother; he was
dressed as Atrocitus and I was geared up as Hal Jordan . We both left the cinema with this opinion
– there are only two words to describe this movie: GOOD FUN!

I know a lot of you who read what I put out will have realized by now that Iâ€™m a massive
Green Lantern fan and there was always a going to be chance (chance? More like a definite fact!)
that I was entering the cinema wearing emerald tinted glasses â€“ 3D ones at that!

But I sat in my seat, watched objectively, and was satisfied with what was, for the most part, an
entertaining family movie.

The story is a classic super hero origin tale: Hal is the reluctant hero tasked with saving the
planet and, yes, it pretty much is something weâ€™ve all seen before. But what most
people havenâ€™t seen is Green Lantern.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/13071272241.jpg?w=1024&h=464

This is the story of cocky test pilot Hal Jordan who shuns responsibility whenever it comes
calling. In fact itâ€™s something heâ€™s afraid of. This incarnation of the
character is head strong but still traumatized by the death of his father as a child; a tragic
aircraft accident from which Martin Jordan could not escape. Hal is chosen by the ring of dying
alien Abin Sur , the Green Lantern of Sector 2814, to become his replacement due to
Halâ€™s ability to overcome fear â€“ something that Hal is to discover during the
course of the movie. He is reluctant to accept this responsibility but is transported to the
planet Oa by the Guardians of the Universe and inducted into the Green Lantern Corps â€“
the interstellar peacekeepers of the universe. Hal quits the Corps after
â€˜difficultiesâ€™ with another Corpsman, the Lantern of Sector 1417, Sinestro.
Throughout all this, an evil entity known as Parallax has been unleashed across the universe
that consumes the souls of those who are afraid and has decimated whole planets in its wake. It
is drawn to Earth by Abin Surâ€™s ring, now in the possession of Hal, who has to come to
terms with his responsibility, conquer his fear and defeat this menace â€“ with or
without the blessing of the Green Lantern Corps.

 

Thatâ€™s it in a nutshell. I donâ€™t want to divulge anymore for those yet to see the
movie but those who know the origin of the Green Lantern will see that this synopsis sticks
pretty much to the plot of Geoff Johns Secret Origin story .

It was always going to be a difficult for DC to put across the Green Lantern story with it being,
literally, so alien but I think Martin Campbell has done an admiral job. I think the style of the
movie harkens back to the superhero movies of the 80â€™s and 90â€™s. The tone is
very light and it is very much directed towards a family audience. That being said, I do think
that Parallax and Hector Hammond may be a bit frightening for younger children due to their
presentation and the threat they pose. Green Lantern is not as dark as story as say, The Dark
Knight, so those expecting a DC movie as grounded and as gritty shouldnâ€™t go in with
that mindset. Itâ€™s colorful and bright and the effects are fantastic.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/sinestro1.jpg?w=480

Ryan Reynolds does a great job as Hal Jordan and much of the worries of the Green Lantern fans can
be put to bed over his portrayal of the character. He does bring his trademark wit to the part but
it never over powers. He becomes very endearing throughout the film, especially as he
overcomes his various struggles. It was good to see a super hero develop and grow over the
course of the movie. Hal doesnâ€™t just get the ring, get his powers and go out and to fight
evil; he battles his own conscience, he fails on a couple of occasions and he has several knock
backs along the way. Reynolds makes Hal Jordan into the perfect everyman and is a relatable
human being, after all under the costume, he is just a man. It also adds to the Green Lantern
ideal that the power is within all of us to overcome fear and battle that which makes us afraid.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/halsinestro1.jpg?w=480

The CGI aliens, from the Guardians to Parallax to the Lanterns, are all brilliantly realized.
Tomar-Re (voiced splendidly by Geoffrey Rush), the alien we spend the most time with, looks
amazing and the rendering is uncannily life-like. Mark Strong steals the show with every
scene he is in as Sinestro, capturing the depth and gravitas of the character. Itâ€™s
just a shame we see so little of him. Unfortunately we donâ€™t spend enough time in the
movie with the other Lanterns, especially fan favorite Kilowog, as I wouldâ€™ve liked.
The induction process is over and done with incredibly quickly which is a shame because the
environment on Oa is beautiful. A lot of work has obviously gone into making the planet look as
natural as possible, with different regions and zones for certain Lanterns, immense
hallways, the Citadel of the Guardians and the Mausoleum.

The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. There never seems to be enough time spent on Oa or with the
other Lanterns but I suppose, with it being an origin story, we have to get to know Hal first. The
action scenes seem to be littered around the film and never seem to be strung together until the
end where events reach their dramatic climax â€“ although they are all awesome
individually.



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/13071273161.jpg?w=1024&h=430

Angela Bassett was an excellent casting choice as Amanda Waller but she again doesnâ€™t
spend enough time on screen. They slight exploration of her character through her exposure to
Hector Hammond left me wanting more and the fact that she wasnâ€™t killed off leaves me
with the suspicion we will be seeing her again. Peter Sarsgaard makes for a particularly
unsettling Hector, especially towards the end as his paranoia and mania begin to take hold.
Blake Lively tries hard but never seemed to connect with me, however I do feel she maybe kept
herself at a distance on purpose. There seems to be a â€œwill they/wonâ€™t
theyâ€� tension between Carol and Hal but it does appear very artificial at times.

Look out for the Easter Eggs too. Check out Carol Ferris â€™ call sign, a peculiar looking
yellow symbol and make sure you donâ€™t immediately leave when the credits start
â€“ youâ€™ll miss a treat every Green Lantern fan should see!

On the whole though, I really enjoyed the movie. It might not have been this summerâ€™s
best superhero film but it was warm, genuine and true to its roots. It was funny and dramatic in
the right places and it appeared quite fresh. The special effects delivered and the story was a
good one and it kept me entertained. The most important thing about Green Lantern was the fun
that shone through at its heart. I and many of the other writers at World of Superheroes have
been saying for months that it would be nice to see or read something that was light-hearted and
innocent and endearing. Thatâ€™s what Green Lantern is. Itâ€™s a comic book movie
thatâ€™s fun. And isnâ€™t that the most important thing that a comic book movie
should be?

Iâ€™ll be honest with you all though, I loved it. I was always going to!

Flying the Standard: WHAT IS RIGHT WITH COMICS



Jun 17

Posted by DAMM

 

Â Issue #1 â€“ Counterparts

*like always there are a few spoilers but as few as possible

Â 

Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/angel.jpg?w=480

By DAMM



Welcome to my counterpart column to Et7e7r7nal DAMMnation where instead of ranting and
screaming I hope to showcase what is right with comic books. Every so often as I read them you
will get to hear which books I think are doing the industry proud and profile the creators and
publishers making these fine publications. I have to tell you right now there WILL be DC books
in here both pre and post re-launch party because it is my job to know comics. This really does
not affect my boycott because my personal money for my own collection will be all creator owned
and indie now. However to be fair I must still read DC and Marvel and recognize the good work they
still do. For example did you see Emerald Knights ? Awesome. So with company dime or from my
friends personal collections I will read them for actual content from a fair distance. If DC
and Marvel want to send me advance PDFâ€™s for review I will. In this line of work
credibility is all I have and I cannot be credible if I do not read the material without bias AND
still stand on principle. For me it means I have to do it this way. Uplift the good here.

Ruse # 1- 4 â€“ Crossgen/Marvel (Mark Waid/Mirco Peirfederici with covers by Butch
Guice/Mike Perkins and Laura Martin )



Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ruse_03_0001.jpg?w=669&h=1024













The re-launch of Ruse under the new Crossgen/Marvel umbrella was some of the most welcome news
I received this year. I read all 26 issues of the original run and was very optimistic about Waid
returning and Guice doing the covers. I could not have been more rewarded. This is a mystery of
the finest caliber, perfectly accented with a humor reminiscent of House or Arthur with the
pompous co-lead Simon Archard (the most brilliant mind for deduction in the city now set in
Victorian England – Partington) and his oblivious to common people problems. His lovely
assistant *ehemm* sorry partner Emma Bishop cleans up his social faux pas and wantonly exerts
herself for fair credit while jousting verbally fantastic with a man who clearly believes
himself superior to everyone. Or does he?

This is what Moonlighting the TV show COULD have been had it been set in this time period, only
smart and funny. The trick to this intricate and sophisticated book (you actually feel
smarter after reading this title) is making itÂ  understandable to non-detective
geniusâ€™ like myself and Waid has done that- again. In what can only be called some of his
finest plotting and original repartee Waid has avoided making this a Sherlock Holmes light or
a Gotham by Gaslight redux by delicately pivoting between the undertones of the dialogue in
relation to characterization. For instance, you as a reader know that the way Emma is being
treated is wrong but she never gives up asserting her will and doesnâ€™t leave. This
creates a discomfort that is relieved in dialogue. When she is bantering you actually feel she
is saying much more. You get it without being beat with it. By the time I got to the GirlFight in
issue three I found myself turning every page a little bit slower because this is a 4 issue mini
that just wrapped up with a fantastic twist and a payoff worth the time invested.





American Vampire: Survival of the Fittest #1 â€“ Vertigo ( Scott Snyder / Sean Murphy/
Dave Stewart/Pat Brosseau)





Image:
http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/av-sotf_01_0001a.jpg?w=409&h=629



Let me go on record here, I hate vampire stories. Ever since Lost Boys there has been infinite
young and hip vampires in a trendy not very vampire like 90210 kind of way. It drives me crazy.
But last week I found Shinku raved about it and every person I know started screaming,
â€œREAD AMERICAN VAMPIRE !!â€�

I love that kind of loyalty and passion from readers. I love how Scott Snyder elicits the kind of
support his work deserves. I then went and bought American Vampire 1-12 and those same voices
said â€œJust read Survival of the Fittest, you do not have to know what came before. It is a
jumping on point.â€� There is a lot being made about jumping on points these days, and to
be honest I have been hard on the current state of the Bat Universe, so I took some advice instead
of knowing it all – this time. I read this first.

Mr. Snyder, my most sincere apologies if I ever offended you. In one issue you have just made me
get a second Vampire Book every month. Has the world gone to Lokiâ€™s daughter? The debut
issue of this personal and gritty tale follows Ms. Felicia Book, from the Vassals of the
Morning Star and she intends to kill the vampires that have infiltrated a giant media
corporation. No one seems to believe a pretty girl about vampires till they find she is packing
heat. She needs a vacation. Bt that would not be in the cards of course. Instead there is a quest.
The characterizations of Felicia Book and Jack Straw come through immediately and fleshed
out which to me as a first time reader was astounding. They felt like I had known them for years
even though I had never met them. I assure you I intend to read American Vampire ongoing now too.
It is a perfect debut.

Green Wake # 1- 3 â€“ IMAGE (Kurtis Wiebe/Riley Rossmo/Kelly Tindall)









Image: http://777damm.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/green-wake-01.jpg?w=384&h=588

Hauntingly stark and beautifully crafted art leads the way on this five part mini about
ghastly mutations and the isolation of being a newcomer in a small town. This book radiates
pain. Deep emotional loss and unresolved grief are a driving mood along freeway thrill ride of
the macabre. The protagonist Morley, is the kind of well written character Johnny Depp would
kill to play only without the melodrama. On the trail of the first killer in Green Wake in years
we meet the motley cast of very real to life characters and their baggage amongst a ghoulish
tale set against the backdrop of a small town social network. It is so thick with dread at times
the book seems to literally get heavier and I hung on every panel like I was 10 years old sifting
through the old Eerie and Creepy magazines my Uncles friendâ€™s had laying around. Only
I am a grown up and I do not get creeped out. Riiiight. Wiebe never reveals so much you are
informed and always lets enough be known to keep you interested. If the remaining issues are
even half as good as these three then a new hit ongoing seems only natural. Horror comics are
making a comeback because of titles like this. Check out these phenomenal pages and see if you
can resist the series.
