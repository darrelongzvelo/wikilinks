Novartis is the sole manufacturer of the drug Coartem, an artemisin based combination therapy which has proven to be one of the most effective treatments for malaria. In 2004 the company had also fallen short of its production goals, but it had\n                        <em>*promised*</em>\n                        that 2005 would be different; that it was capable of meeting demand. Both years the company blamed their production failure on few initial orders and shortages of the plant quingtao, indigenous to China, from which arteminsin is derived.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Recently a group of scientists at University of California, Berkeley bioengineered yeast,\n                        <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>\n                        , to produce a precursor to arteminisin. The process involves the enzyme amorphadiene synthase that catalyzes the production of amorphadiene from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Cytochrome P450 then facilitates the next step of producing artemisinic acid. From artemisinic acid; the final step to the arteminisin compound is arguably cheaper than full synthesis of arteminisin would be. The research team says that this represents significant progress towards producing a more affordable treatment for malaria, although subsequent optimization of the process in order to produce a drug is likely 5 or 10 years away.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The researchers previously engineered\n                        <em>E.coli</em>\n                        to produce amorphadiene, an isoprenoid precursor to artemisinic acid, in research that was published in 2003 in the journal\n                        <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>\n                        ; &quot;Engineering a mevalonate pathway in Escherichia coli for production of terpenoids&quot; (published online June 1, 2003), described here on the\n                        <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/06/02_yeast.shtml" shape="rect">Berkeley</a>\n                        press release site.

Posthaste, a group of Manhattan Project scientists urged policies of non-proliferation. The scientists must have been jubilant about their technological success, so the turnaround to hand-waving caution, was remarkable. It was almost as thought they had thought ahead of time about the dangers of the science but were driven to do the experiments anyway.  Needless to say, once unleashed, the nuclear technology thrived. Weapons and civilian applications of nuclear energy proliferated despite the scientists\' caution.\n                      </p>\n                      <p> Then came Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Twenty years ago an explosion and fire at the Chernobyl power plant in the Soviet Union unnerved a world that had grown accustomed to relying on nuclear energy. Through the Cold War, people got used to living with the alarms of air raids, but the ultimate containment of nuclear weapons. The accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania had given ample warning of the type of accident that could happen, but Chernobyl truly frightened the world. In May 19, 1986, Time magazine reported on the wide repercussions of the accident:\n                      </p>\n                      <ul>\n                        <li> In Italy livestock that arrived from Eastern Europe were returned because radiation levels in the animals tested too high. </li>\n                        <li> In Japan milk and water were found to be contaminated. </li>\n                        <li> In Ottawa rain was found to have six time the amount of radiation than is safe for drinking water </li>\n                      </ul>\n                      <p>\n                        In the US traces of radiation were found in ther Pacific Northwest and New  York. People were concerned about drinking water. Donald Macdonald, Acting Assistant Secretary of health said, in what appears to be a more candid era:\n                        <em>&quot;I would drink it, and that\'s what the guidelines say, but I would prefer not to drink it.&quot;</em>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        A\n                        <em>Financial Times</em>\n                        reporter last week took a\n                        <a href="https://registration.ft.com/registration/barrier?referer=&amp;location=http%3A//news.ft.com/cms/s/7b8fa3e8-c544-11da-b675-0000779e2340.html" shape="rect">&quot;holiday&quot;</a>\n                        in Chernobyl, where the tour business now apparently thrives.

People are increasingly swayed by businesses that see opportunity in softening public opinion. To aid the perceptions of safety, some papers are reporting an abundance of wildlife inhabiting areas close to Chernobyl, as if the arrival of stray dogs and flower\'s in a radiation zone should stay our concerns about the renewed enthusiasm for all things nuclear.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) issued a report last autumn, which said that deaths from Chernobyl would number about 4,000. However, Greenpeace writes in a recent report that that number is highly underestimated. The Greenpeace data places the actual numbers at 270,000 cancers and 93,000 fatal cancer cases directly caused by Chernobyl. On April 18, 2006: Greenpeace\n                        <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/releases/greenpeace-new-study-reveals-d" shape="rect">published</a>\n                        &quot;Chernobyl Catastrophe Consequences on Human Health&quot;.  The report refutes the IAEA, and accuses it of &quot;whitewashing&quot; the data to promote nuclear energy. Among other things, Greenpeace faults the IAEA with deriving data from limited subsets of effected populations. One criticism is that IAEA notes that 212 of 72,000 clean-up personel died, but\n                        <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/releases/whitewashing-chernobyl-s-impac" shape="rect">Greenpeace says</a>\n                        that the more accurate number of &quot;liquidators&quot; or &quot;bio-robots&quot;, was 600,000. Accurate data sets are essential for making public policy and if Greenpeace\' contention is true, such data manipulation is unconscionable.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Nuclear technology continues to be propagated for political aims.

If not your own island then maybe an estate that you call a &quot;the bungalow&quot;, with an exclusive beach to escape the hubbub of work, no deadlines, only the warm sun, gently lapping water, and soft sand to dig your toes into. Quintessential relaxation. You know the places -- with the private boat docks, dozens of bedrooms, turrets here and there, golf course-like lawns, and helicopter pads?\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Perusing the news in this getaway state of mind on these chilly December-January-February-March-April days any advertisement for a beach vacation seems attractive. Even a gratuitous palm tree at the top of an online airline ad has me pining for warm sand and azure seas. Then there\'s the full page NYT ad for St. Regis resorts and residences in Florida.\n                        <em>&quot;Couture living&quot;</em>\n                        it brags, summoning the languor of luxury in a not so understated way:\n                        <em>&quot;Introducing unparalleled oceanfront residences...exquisite design...bespoke lifestyle...enviable address.&quot;</em>\n                        The quiet escape that shouts you\'ve arrived.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Alongside the come-hither text, a woman perambulates through the surf in a white evening dress, a take no prisoners expression on her face, a  box suitcase in hand, and a white-gloved attendant trailing behind with the \nluggage. The photo seems inspired by Jack Vettriano\'s\n                        <a href="http://www.vettriano-art.com/happydays2.html" shape="rect">Oh, Happy Days</a>\n                        .  But the vignette nags uncomfortably, despite the cold of the day and the rain pounding against the window. There is a threatening amount of ocean in the photo, a montage of water up to the well-off vacationer\'s shins, tugging at her fancy clothes and old clunky but fashionable leather suitcases. Vettriano didn\'t do this to his subjects, he placed them safely on solid sand to dance. And as reports of glaciers melting and oceans rising pour in, wading through water in your evening wear, even with a lot of gumption, could be a not so happy harbinger of things to come.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        I\'m not the first to think that island properties and beach front resorts in Florida are worrisome, but I find especially discomfiting the insouciance of the ad\'s presentation, its inadvertent reflection of all too common attitudes about global warming.  Of course people with business stakes in islands would wave off my concern. My queries to online purveyors of island properties quickly yielded e-mail brochures informing me that was business is\n                        <em>just fine</em>\n                        .\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        While I can understand the positions of realtors who have a livelihood to protect, I don\'t understand those who dismiss global warming without such interests.  It would be in their best interest to fight against global warming.

This, despite the fact that Crichton himself writes in his book contains \'real footnotes\' but the story is fiction.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        In a casual discussion about global climate change I engaged in recently, more then a few of the dozen or so participants said that there was not enough evidence for climate change to support taking steps to lower carbon emissions. To bolster their arguments they of course recruited Crichton, and George Will, who rhetorically rolls his eyes, throws his hands in the air and complains  that\n                        <em>first</em>\n                        the scientists thought it was global cooling,\n                        <a href="http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/63819.htm" shape="rect">\n                          and\n                          <em>now</em>\n                        </a>\n                        they  say it\'s global warming.

One must steadfastly ignore decades of evidence and data from all the corporations who acknowledge the evidence.

You want to trust that they\'re sincere and if they had just taken one more science class we could all band together in recognizing the urgency of the problem. But as the evidence spans decades and the tenor of the climate rhetoric remains relentlessly constant, it\'s obvious that this is a game of posturing, where roles are defined, for and against. This is a game with a structure defined to frame many decades of disagreement. It\'s not so much a path to resolution as a face-off like a couple of gangs of boys in a schoolyard with shoving and stare-downs.

Tuvalu, whose highest point is 5 meters above sea level, is called greedy (as many would accuse the oil companies of being) because it threatened to sue the U.S. and Australia for\n                        <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,99627,00.html" shape="rect">environmental negligence</a>\n                        . One op-ed writer at conservative PR organization CEI accused Tuvalu of trying to exploit global warming with the &quot;phony neck brace of 21st-century litigiousness&quot;. Oil company advocates accused a collective of states in the U.S. who legally demanded federal action to reduce emissions of trying to ruin the economy via\n                        <a href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1338" shape="rect">&quot;pseudo-tort intimidation suits&quot;</a>\n                        .\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Each headline that shows more evidence of warming is greeted with hope from those who believe that the naysayers really, really do need one more piece of evidence to convince them.
