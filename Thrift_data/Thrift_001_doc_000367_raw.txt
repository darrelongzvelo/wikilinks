Ex-C.I.A. Chief, in Book, Assails Cheney on Iraq



  By SCOTT SHANE and MARK MAZZETTI  

 

WASHINGTON, April 26 â€” George J. Tenet , the former director of central intelligence,
has lashed out against Vice President Dick Cheney and other Bush administration officials in
a new book, saying they pushed the country to war in Iraq without ever conducting a
â€œserious debateâ€� about whether Saddam Hussein posed an imminent threat to the
United States.

The 549-page book, â€œAt the Center of the Storm,â€� is to be published by
HarperCollins on Monday. By turns accusatory, defensive, and modestly self-critical, it is
the first detailed account by a member of the presidentâ€™s inner circle of the Sept. 11,
2001, terrorist attacks, the decision to invade Iraq and the failure to find the
unconventional weapons that were a major justification for the war.

â€œThere was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the
imminence of the Iraqi threat,â€� Mr. Tenet writes in a devastating judgment that is
likely to be debated for many years. Nor, he adds, â€œwas there ever a significant
discussionâ€� about the possibility of containing Iraq without an invasion.

Mr. Tenet admits that he made his famous â€œslam dunkâ€� remark about the evidence
that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But he argues that the quote was taken out of context
and that it had little impact on President Bushâ€™s decision to go to war. He also makes
clear his bitter view that the administration made him a scapegoat for the Iraq war.

A copy of the book was purchased at retail price in advance of publication by a reporter for The
New York Times. Mr. Tenet described with sarcasm watching an episode of â€œMeet the
Pressâ€� last September in which Mr. Cheney twice referred to Mr. Tenetâ€™s
â€œslam dunkâ€� remark as the basis for the decision to go to war.

â€œI remember watching and thinking, â€˜As if you needed me   to say â€˜slam
dunkâ€™ to convince you to go to war with Iraq,â€™ â€� Mr. Tenet writes.

As violence in Iraq spiraled beginning in late 2003, Mr. Tenet writes, â€œrather than
acknowledge responsibility, the administrationâ€™s message was: Donâ€™t
blame us. George Tenet and the C.I.A. got us into this mess.â€�

Mr. Tenet takes blame for the flawed 2002 National Intelligence Estimate about
Iraqâ€™s weapons programs, calling the episode â€œone of the lowest moments of my
seven-year tenure.â€� He expresses regret that the document was not more nuanced, but
says there was no doubt in his mind at the time that Saddam Hussein possessed unconventional
weapons. â€œIn retrospect, we got it wrong partly because the truth was so
implausible,â€� he writes.

Despite such sweeping indictments, Mr. Bush, who in 2004 awarded Mr. Tenet a Presidential
Medal of Freedom, is portrayed personally in a largely positive light, with particular
praise for the his leadership after the 2001 attacks. â€œHe was absolutely in charge,
determined, and directed,â€� Mr. Tenet writes of the president, whom he describes as a
blunt-spoken kindred spirit.

But Mr. Tenet largely endorses the view of administration critics that Mr. Cheney and a
handful of Pentagon officials, including Paul D. Wolfowitz and Douglas J. Feith, were
focused on Iraq as a threat in late 2001 and 2002 even as Mr. Tenet and the C.I.A. concentrated
mostly on Al Qaeda .

Mr. Tenet describes helping to kill a planned speech by Mr. Cheney on the eve of the invasion
because its claims of links between Al Qaeda and Iraq went â€œway beyond what the
intelligence shows.â€�

â€œMr. President, we cannot support the speech and it should not be given,â€� Mr.
Tenet wrote that he told Mr. Bush. Mr. Cheney never delivered the remarks.

Mr. Tenet hints at some score-settling in the book. He describes in particular the
extraordinary tension between him and Condoleezza Rice , then national security adviser,
and her deputy, Stephen J. Hadley, in internal debate over how the president came to say
erroneously in his 2003 State of the Union address that Iraq was seeking uranium in Africa.

He describes an episode in 2003, shortly after he issued a statement taking partial
responsibility for that error. He said he was invited over for a Sunday afternoon, back-patio
lemonade by Colin L. Powell , then secretary of state. Mr. Powell described what Mr. Tenet
called â€œa lively debateâ€� on Air Force One a few days before about whether the
White House should continue to support Mr. Tenet as C.I.A. director.

â€œIn the end, the president said yes, and said so publicly,â€� Mr. Tenet wrote.
â€œBut Colin let me know that other officials, particularly the vice president, had
quite another view.â€�

He writes that the controversy over who was to blame for the State of the Union error was the
beginning of the end of his tenure. After the finger-pointing between the White House and the
C.I.A., he wrote, â€œMy relationship with the administration was forever
changed.â€�

Mr. Tenet also says in the book that he had been â€œnot at all sure I wanted to
acceptâ€� the Medal of Freedom. He agreed after he saw that the citation â€œwas all
about the C.I.A.â€™s work against terrorism, not Iraq.â€�

He also expresses skepticism about whether the increase in troops in Iraq will prove
successful. â€œIt may have worked more than three years ago,â€� he wrote.
â€œMy fear is that sectarian violence in Iraq has taken on a life of its own and that U.S.
forces are becoming more and more irrelevant to the management of that violence.â€�

Mr. Tenet says he decided to write the memoir in part because the infamous â€œslam
dunkâ€� episode had come to define his tenure at C.I.A.

He gives a detailed account of the episode, which occurred during an Oval Office meeting in
December 2002 when the administration was preparing to make public its case for war against
Iraq.

During the meeting, the deputy C.I.A. director, John McLaughlin, unveiled a draft of a
proposed public presentation that left the group unimpressed. Mr. Tenet recalls that Mr.
Bush suggested that they could â€œadd punchâ€� by bringing in lawyers trained to
argue cases before a jury.

â€œI told the president that strengthening the public presentation was a â€˜slam
dunk,â€™ a phrase that was later taken completely out of context,â€� Mr. Tenet
writes. â€œIf I had simply said, â€˜Iâ€™m sure we can do better,â€™ I
wouldnâ€™t be writing this chapter â€” or maybe even this book.â€�

Mr. Tenet has spoken rarely in public, and never so caustically, since stepping down in July
2004.

Asked about Mr. Tenetâ€™s assertions, a White House spokesman, Gordon D. Johndroe,
defended the prewar deliberations on Thursday. â€œThe president made the decision to
remove Saddam Hussein for a number of reasons, mainly the National Intelligence Estimate on
Iraq and Saddam Husseinâ€™s own actions, and only after a thorough and lengthy
assessment of all available information as well as Congressional authorization,â€�
the spokesman said.

The book recounts C.I.A. efforts to fight Al Qaeda in the years before the Sept. 11 attacks, and
Mr. Tenetâ€™s early warnings about Osama bin Laden . He contends that the urgent appeals
of the C.I.A. on terrorism received a lukewarm reception at the Bush White House through most
of 2001.

â€œThe bureaucracy moved slowly,â€� and only after the Sept. 11 attacks was the
C.I.A. given the counterterrorism powers it had requested earlier in the year.

Mr. Tenet confesses to â€œa black, black timeâ€� two months after the 2001 attacks
when, sitting in front of his house in his favorite Adirondack chair, he â€œjust lost
it.â€�

â€œI thought about all the people who had died and what we had been through in the months
since,â€� he writes. â€œWhat am I doing here? Why me?â€� Mr. Tenet gives a
vigorous defense of the C.I.A.â€™s program to hold captured Qaeda members in secret
overseas jails and to question them with harsh techniques, which he does not explicitly
describe.

Mr. Tenet expresses puzzlement that, since 2001, Al Qaeda has not sent â€œsuicide
bombers to cause chaos in a half-dozen American shopping malls on any given day.â€�

â€œI do know one thing in my gut,â€� he writes. â€œAl Qaeda is here and
waiting.â€�

Shehab-3 missile              

Image: http://www.debka.com/images/spacer.gif    

Mohammad Baqer Solghadr, deputy interior minister, has been tagged for this top post by
Iranian leaders engrossed in war preparations, according to DEBKA file â€™s Iranian
sources. He told the official Iranian news agency IRNA Thursday: â€œNowhere would be
safe for America with (Iranâ€™s) long-range missilesâ€Š we can fire tens of
thousands of missiles every day.â€� He added: â€œWith long-range missiles Iran
can also threaten Israel as Americaâ€™s allyâ€� and US Middle East bases.

DEBKA file â€™s military sources report that Solghadr was not overstating
Iranâ€™s missile capabilities. The Islamic Republicâ€™s expanded war
preparations must be taken into account as encompassing Syria, the Lebanese Hizballah and
the Palestinian Hamas, the Jihad Islami, the Fatah-al Aqsa Brigades and the Popular
Resistance Committees. Tehran has armed and harnessed these allies and proxies for response
to a US or Israeli attack on Iran which Tehran is certain is planned for the summer months.

They have been fed with an assortment of missiles of varying ranges by Iranian air and sea
lifts. Putting together the missile arsenals piled up in Iran, Syria, and amassed by
Hizballah and Palestinian groups yields a total that makes a daily barrage of several
thousand missiles against Israel and US regional bases feasible. This deterrent, put in
place over several months, allowed Zolghadr to issue his threat with confidence.

His words were also a response to last weekâ€™s visits by US defense secretary Robert
Gates to Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Iraq, which Tehran took to be a rallying of allies as part of
Washingtonâ€™s preparations for war.

In Ankara, the European Unionâ€™s foreign policy executive Javier Solana and
Iranâ€™s nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani held a second session Thursday, April 26,
aimed at ending the standoff over Iranâ€™s nuclear program. Solana reported progress
but â€œno big breakthrough.â€�

  History



The Beretta 92 pistol evolved from earlier Beretta designs, most notably the M1922 and M1951 .
From the M1922 comes the open slide design, while the alloy frame and locking block barrel
(originally from Walther P38 ) were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight
integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols.

The Beretta 92 first appeared in 1976 and was designed by Carlo Beretta, Giuseppe Mazzetti and
Vittorio Valle, all experienced firearms designers on the Beretta design team.



  92



About 5000 copies of the first design were manufactured from 1975 to 1976.



  92S



In order to meet requirements of some law enforcement agencies, Beretta modified the Beretta
92 by adding a slide-mounted combined safety and decocking lever, replacing the frame
mounted manual thumb safety. This resulted in the 92S which was adopted by several Italian law
enforcement and military units. The later relocation of the magazine release button means
these models (92 & 92S) cannot necessarily use later magazines, unless they have notches in
both areas.



  92SB (92S-1)



    Initially called the 92S-1 when it was specifically designed for US Air Force trials
    (which it won), the model name officially adopted was the 92SB . It included the changes of
    the 92S, added a firing pin safety, and relocated the magazine release catch from the
    bottom of the grip to the lower bottom of the trigger guard.

    - 92SB Compact (1981 â€“ 1991), shortened barrel and slide (13-round magazine
    capacity). It was replaced by the "92 Compact L".

    





  92F (92SB-F)



    Beretta modified the model 92SB slightly to create the 92F (and 92G) by making the
    following changes:

    - Redesigned all the parts to make them interchangeable between 92 variants to simplify
    maintenance for large government organizations.

    

    - Modified the front of the trigger guard so that one could use finger support for easier
    aiming.

    

    - Modified the front angle of the grip to allow for better instinctive aiming.

    

    - Hard chromed the barrel bore to protect it from corrosion and to reduce wear.

    

    - New surface coating on the slide called Bruniton , which allegedly provides better
    corrosion resistance than the previous plain blued finish.

    





  Introduction of polymers



After 1992 Beretta started producing model 92s with some polymer parts, to reduce wear and
save production costs. Polymer parts found on newer pistols include guide rods, triggers,
safety levers, hammer spring caps, lanyard loops, and magazine bottom plates and followers.

qualification course Feb. 4 as part of their MSG graduation requirement

When the U.S. Air Force (USAF) began the Joint Service Small Arms Program , Beretta entered the
competition. The Beretta 92SB (92S-1) won, but the Army contested the Air Force's methods.
There would be several more competitions, and Beretta refined the design of the Beretta 92SB
into the Beretta 92SB-F and in slightly modified form the Beretta 92G. These designs were
ultimately selected by the United States (Beretta 92F, U.S. Military designation of M9
Pistol ) and France (Beretta 92G, French military designation of " PAMAS "). The M9 Pistol was
intended to replace the M1911A1 and .38-caliber revolvers and pistols. Over 500,000 M9
pistols were made and the switch-over was largely achieved.

The USAF has scheduled switching over from the early model M9 (92F) to the 92FS standard,
according to planning documents. In May 2005, the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) posted its intent
to award a sole-source contract to Beretta for 3,480 "M9A1" pistols (M9 with an accessory
rail, also available to the public from June 2006). In the U.S. Army, selected M9s were
scheduled to be replaced by XM8 compact carbine variants. However, XM8 and the entire OICW
Increment 1 program were suspended in July 2005. Current model M9s are scheduled for
replacement under the Future Handgun System , which was merged with USSOCOM's SOF Combat
Pistol program to create the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) program. The JCP winner is specified as
having a number of new features; chambered for .45 ACP , an integrated rail, Day/Night sights,
and capable of accepting a sound suppressor. In early 2006, the JCP program was renamed Combat
Pistol and seemingly split from the Army program.

Confusing matters, the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) purchased
5,000 Ruger P95 and 5,000 SIG SP2022 (SIGPro) pistols in December 2004. However, these
pistols were purchased solely for issue to Iraqi security forces.



  Early problems

Disassembled Beretta M9

Beretta had two major contracts, about 500,000 units for the U.S. armed forces and about
230,000 units for the French armed forces. In the case of the Beretta 92G, it was agreed that the
French would supply the slide steel to Italy until GIAT could start licensed production.
Beretta then decided to use 5,000 semi finished slides, intended for the French, to build
pistols for the U.S. military. Soon after the US accepted these pistols, a few 92F slides,
(less than 10 total) and some older Beretta 92SB slides started to crack and fly off the frame.

An investigation would later determine that this lot had been made with French steel slides
which were determined to be metallurgically inferior. Compounding this was 9mm Luger
ammunition made in the US whose pressure far exceeded specifications. It was also discovered
that the locking block required a design change to increase its service life. The US military
decided to replace their M9 locking blocks after 5,000 rounds, which gave the gun a bad
reputation on the civilian market as a gun with a short life. With the new version of the locking
block installed however, the gun was a success and the locking block is now rated for 25,000
rounds. However, something still needed to be done to reduce the risk being struck by the back
of a slide if it should break. The solution was to enlarge the hammer pin head to act as a slide
retention device. A shallow slot in the base of the slider is cut just long enough to clear the
hammer pin head during normal travel, but arrests the slide's backward travel if the slide
fails. This simple change resulted in the Beretta 92FS. Since then nearly all Beretta pistols
are fitted with this simple safety feature.

Tests were also carried out using a stronger closed slide, instead of the now famous cut-away
version, but this reduced the ability of the pistol to dislodge sand and debris caught between
the barrel and slide. Beretta eventually designed a new slide, one less prone to breakage, by
thickening the slide wall at its weakest point. This came to be known as the Brigadier slide.
Ironically, although the initial cause of slide breakages had already been remedied, the
Brigadier is still sold today as a popular variant as its greater weight helps to control
recoil. It also allows the owner to adjust or replace the front sight if so desired.

The trigger spring, which is responsible for resetting the trigger to its original position
after each trigger pull, has also been improved. There had been cases where the spring would
break which would require the shooter to manually push the trigger forward. Beretta remedied
this by changing the spring's design so that each leg is similar, allowing it to be inverted in
case one leg fails. Periodic inspection and replacement of this spring is recommended.



  Design



The Beretta 92's open slide design ensures visible feeding and ejection of ammunition and
allows the barrel to cool quickly. The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and
protects it from corrosion. The locking block barrel lockup provides good accuracy and
operability with suppressors due to the in-line travel of the barrel. This is in contrast to
the complex travel of Browning designed barrels. The magazine release button is reversible
with simple field tools. Reversing the magazine release makes left-handed operation much
easier.

Increasingly, it has become popular to reduce handgun weight using light alloys or polymers,
and polymer parts have started showing up in Beretta 92/96 models too. In 2004, the first
internal polymer part to be introduced was a recoil spring guide. Many Beretta owners were
displeased with the polymer part just because it was "plastic". The polymer recoil spring
guide works as well as its steel counterpart but it is possible that weight of the steel part
helped reduce recoil. In 2005 new polymer parts started to appear in Beretta 92/96 series
guns. New polymer parts include safety levers, trigger, slide release, lanyard loop,
magazine floor, and the disassembly latch.



  Variants



The Beretta 92 is available in many configurations each with a distinct model name. Combining
the various options results in more than 50 different configurations, but the major variants
are defined by their operation caliber (92/96/98), operation (FS/G/D/DS) and combination
of optional items (Inox/Brigadier slide/Compact length):



  Calibers



    Each model name starts with two digits identifying the caliber:

        92

    

        Chambered for the 9 x 19 mm Parabellum .

    

        96

    

        Chambered for the .40 S&W , introduced in 1990.

    

        98

    

        Chambered for 9 x 21 mm IMI . This option was introduced in 1991 for markets where it is
        illegal to own a weapon chambered for a military cartridge like 9 x 19 mm.

    





  Operation

    

        FS (standard)

    

        The current production version of the 92F with the only change being the addition of a
        slide-mounted ambidextrous safety (also acts as decocking lever) and a bigger
        hammer pin and slot in the slide to stop over travel. It is this version that was
        adopted by the US Army as the M9 Pistol .

    

        G (no safety)

    

        This version was created for and adopted by the French Military as PAMAS ; it is simply
        a model 92F with a decocking lever that does not also act as safety lever.

    

        D (double-action, no safety)

    

        The double-action-only variant of the 92F or FS.

    

        DS (double-action with safety)

    

        The double-action-only variant of the 92F or FS that includes a safety.

    





  Options

    

        Vertec

    

            (2003 â€“)

            - New vertical grip.

        single-action-only and single/double-action variants exist. Also used and
        desirable for competitive shooting because of its steel frame (for added weight &
        strength), the frame-mounted safety and/or Vertec-style grip-frame that are all
        found to be desirable features in a competition gun.]

    





  Magazine Capacity



To keep in line with the introduction of laws in some locations restricting magazines that
hold more than 10 rounds, Beretta now manufactures magazines that hold less than the factory
standard 15 rounds. These magazines have heavier crimping (deeper indentations in the side)
to reduce the available space while still keeping the same external dimensions and ensuring
that these magazines can be used on existing firearms.



  93R



The Beretta 93R is a significantly redesigned 92 to provide the option of firing in
three-round bursts. It also has a longer ported barrel, heavier slide, fitting for a shoulder
stock, extra forward grip, and an extended magazine. Unlike the other berettas in the 90
series it doesn't have a decocker and very few are around today.



  Taurus



The Beretta 92 was designed for sports and law enforcement use and, due to its reliability, was
accepted by military users in South America. The first large contract for the Beretta 92 was
with the Brazilian army , for which Beretta set up a factory in Brazil. It later sold this
factory to the Brazilian gunmaker Taurus .

Taurus continues to make pistols (under license from Beretta) based on the original Beretta
92, calling it the PT92 , the barrel of which is still interchangeable with a Beretta 92. Taurus
modified the original Beretta 92 design, and its recent pistols have the magazine release
located behind the trigger guard, and different safeties that act as decocking levers when
pulled down and trigger locks when pushed up, presenting the end-user with a different
variety of safety options.

  Overview



Mainly known for being the manufacturer of polymer - framed pistols , Glock also produces
equipment such as field knives and entrenching tools . The company started life as a
manufacturer of curtain rods, then branched out into supplying the Austrian Army with
machine gun belts, practice hand grenades, plastic magazines, field knives and entrenching
tools. Since then, the company has added different options and accessories such as tactical
lights and a quick-draw holster to its product line.

While Glock marketing materials spell the company name as if it were an acronym ("GLOCK"),
newspapers in Austria, Germany , and the United States forgo the capitalization of all
letters in the interest of readability.

Its first handgun model was the Glock 17 , a 9 mm Luger Parabellum semi-automatic pistol with a
magazine capacity of 17 rounds (unusually large at the time), introduced in the early 1980s as
a response to the Austrian army's request for a new sidearm. Glock pistols are popular with law
enforcement agencies , the military , security personnel, and private citizens. Glock was
the first manufacturer to offer models chambered in the .40 S&W cartridge ( Glock 22 & Glock 23 -
1990), beating Smith & Wesson to the marketplace with their own cartridge. The Glock 22 is
currently (as of mid-2006) the single most popular police sidearm in use in the United States.
The Glock 19, a compact version of the Glock 17, remains one of the most popular 9mm firearms in
the world.

Glock also offers pistols chambered in .357 SIG , .380 ACP , 10 mm Auto , .45 ACP , and the new .45
GAP (Glock Automatic Pistol). A very rare run of 9Ã—21 mm Glock 19 pistols were made. [1]
Glock .380 pistols are not currently available in the United States due to the BATFE 's point
system. [2]

"C" models are built with a "compensator" feature to reduce recoil.

The company is privately held and does not make public any figures concerning its revenue or
internal operations.

3rd Gen

Glock reports sales of over 2.5 million handguns in over 100 countries.

Glock sidearms are very common handguns among law enforcement agencies and military
organizations around the world. They are standard-issue sidearms for the Austrian ,
Belgian, Dutch, and Norwegian Army and Northern Irish police forces, various special units
such as the German GSG 9 counter-terrorism unit of the German Federal Police , Specialist
Firearms Command of the London Metropolitan Police Service as well as the new Iraq security
forces.

Many estimates place Glock's market share among U.S. police departments at over 60% (based on
total number of guns sold, not percentage of departments). Glock's website states their
pistols are "...in use in 65% of law enforcement agencies." The U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation issues all agents graduating from the FBI Academy a Glock 22 or Glock 23
according to the agent's preference. [3] As well, .40 caliber Glock pistols are issued to all
new agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration . [4] All Australian police services
apart from the South Australian Police and Victoria Police use Glock handguns. Glock pistols
are also issued to Australian Customs officers, [5] and the South Australian Police Force is
currently examining whether or not to replace their current stock of .357 Smith & Wesson
revolvers with a Glock model. [6]

The New Zealand Police carry the Glock 17 in situations where weapons are issued. The demand
for Glock pistols is such that despite the European Union enforcing an arms embargo against
Israel , Glock 17s and Glock 19s are standard service pistols in certain Israeli military and
paramilitary units ( Yamam , Shayetet 13 , Shabak , and private security firms) and remain
extremely popular handguns on Israel's private citizen market.

Most of the steel components in a Glock pistol are treated with a nitriding process called "
Tenifer ", which greatly increases the surface hardness and makes the weapon highly
resistant to corrosion and wear.

The popularity of Glock pistols is due to several factors. They are renowned for their
reliability, being able to function under extreme conditions and to fire a wide range of
ammunition types due to their rugged construction. The simplicity of the Glock design
contributes to this reliability, as it contains a relatively small number of components
(nearly half as many as the typical handgun) making field maintenance and repair easier. Also
the disassembly for the Glock pistol is simple, making it easy to detail strip without
expensive tools. [ citation needed ]

They are significantly lighter than typical steel or aluminum-frame handguns, which makes
them attractive for police officers and private citizens who carry a concealed handgun for
self-defense . Another feature of Glock pistols preferred by many users is a lack of external
controls such as levers, decockers, or manual safeties. This adds to the simplicity of use and
removes a potential source of errors when operating the handgun under stress.

Many Glock shooters feel that the relatively low height of the bore above the grip results in
less torque when shooting and lower perceived recoil, leading to increased accuracy. Glock
also claims that its " Safe Action " safety system results in smoother, more consistent
trigger pull than for a conventional double-action pistol.



  "Plastic pistol" myths

Image: http://en.wikipedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png Glock 22 in
the new Olive Drab frame (with magazine)

Contrary to early reports, Glock pistols do set off metal detectors and can indeed be detected
by X-ray machines, due to their metal barrels and slides. The claim that they could not was
first made in an article published in the Washington Post on January 13 , 1985 , entitled,
"Quaddafi Buying Austrian Plastic Pistol." In this article, vocal gun control advocate Jack
Anderson made the allegations, which were then reported without fact-checking by the
Associated Press and further reported by many United States television news stations and
newspapers . It has since become an urban legend that to this day continues to appear in news
reports and movies, and has even been a topic of debate in the United States Congress .

In fact, 83.7% (by weight) of the Glock pistol is normal ordnance steel and the "plastic" parts
are a dense polymer known as 'Polymer 2' which is radio-opaque and is therefore visible to
X-ray security equipment. In addition, virtually all of these "plastic" parts contain
embedded steel to make them functional and shoot better, not to make them "detectable".
Contrary to popular movies like Die Hard 2: Die Harder , neither Glock nor any other gun maker
has ever produced a " ceramic " or "plastic" firearm which is undetectable by ordinary
security screening devices. Even if a pistol completely undetectable by either X-ray
machines or metal detectors were to be developed, the ammunition inside would still be
detectable.

In Die Hard 2 , the character John McClane portrayed by Bruce Willis specifically referred to a
non-existent Glock 7 with many fictitious characteristics:

That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me! You know what that is? It's a porcelain gun made in Germany. It
doesn't show up on your airport X-ray machines, and it costs more than you make here in a month!

Mike Papac , an armorer at Cinema Weaponry , which supplied the Glock pistols used in Die Hard 2 ,
has stated, "I remember when we did that scene, I tried to talk them out of it. There's no such
thing as a gun invisible to metal detectors, and there shouldn't be, but they wouldn't budge.
They had it written into the script and that was that.". [7]

The Glock pistol design was not the first to incorporate a plastic frame. Heckler & Koch used
polymer for their VP70 pistol frame in 1970. HK's innovation of polymer frames and polygonal
rifling seem to have been influential in the Glock design. Still earlier, Remington
introduced their polymer-framed Nylon 66 Rifle in 1959. This was so revolutionary at the time
that Remington dyed the plastic brown to resemble wood and fitted a cosmetic sheet-metal
cover on the receiver to make it appear to be made from steel. Further, the most extensive use of
polymers in a pistol was in the Ram-Line Exactor pistol with a barrel made from steel-lined
plastic.

However, the popularity of Glock pistols seems to have encouraged other manufacturers to
begin production of similar polymer-framed products in recent years, such as the
Springfield XD pistols.



  Safety mechanism



    Glock pistols use an internal safety mechanism with three components, with no external
    thumb activated safety switch as might be found on traditional-design pistols. Glock
    calls this the " Safe Action " system. All three safeties are disabled one after the other
    when the trigger is depressed. They are:

    - Trigger Safety: An external lever mechanism contained within the trigger that
    prevents the trigger from moving unless the lever is depressed.

    

    

    - Striker Safety: A spring-loaded pin attached by an extension bar to the trigger
    assembly blocks the striker from striking the primer of the cartridge until the trigger
    is pulled.

    

    

    - Drop Safety: The far end of the same extension bar locks the striker into place from the
    rear until the trigger is pulled.

    



Similar systems for internal safeties have since become standard for many major
manufacturers of semi-automatic pistols . However, Glock pistols, like any other firearm,
can discharge and cause injury or death if the operator accidentally or negligently
manipulates the trigger. The absence of a traditional safety switch means that Glock users
who intend to carry the gun on their person with the loaded chamber must be cautious (as they
should be for any type of firearm) of keeping their finger off of the trigger when holstering or
unholstering the gun.

In 2003, Glock announced the Internal Locking System (ILS). The ILS is a manually activated
lock that is located in the back of the pistol's grip. It is cylindrical in design and,
according to Glock, each key is unique. Group key hierarchic solutions are available for law
enforcement agencies. When activated, the lock causes a tab to protrude from the rear of the
grip. This is done to give both a visual and tactile indication as to whether the lock is engaged
or not. When activated, the ILS renders the Glock unfireable as well as making it impossible to
disassemble. When disengaged, the ILS adds no further safety mechanisms to the Glock pistol.

The ILS is available as an option on all Glock pistols except for the G36 , but not all
ILS-equipped Glock pistols are carried by distributors nor imported with the option. The
most commonly available Glock pistols with the ILS are the G17 , G19 , G22 , G23 , G26 , and the G27 .



  Misconceptions about Glock pistol operation



Glock handguns have seen much fictional exposure in action movies and TV shows that often
continue to spread misconceptions about the Glock pistol. One common aspect of popular media
portrayals of the Glock pistol is when someone pulls out or points a Glock pistol, the sound
effect of the Glock being "cocked" like a revolver is inserted. The Glock pistol does not have
an external hammer and thus cannot be "cocked" or "uncocked" in the conventional manner and
does not make the sort of sounds that are commonly heard in TV and movies .

Similarly, after a Glock has fired the final round in its magazine, the slide will lock in the
open position. (This functionality is not unique to Glock, because it is common with most
semi-automatic pistols.) At this point the trigger cannot be pulled, hence there will be no
audible click of the firing pin striking forward. Since the gun is designed to lock open the
slide after firing the final round, a shooter will often be surprised to find that he or she is
out of ammo should the slide inadvertently close on an empty chamber. Pulling the trigger in
this condition will produce an audible click and the trigger will remain in the rearward
position since the slide is not actuated backwards. Hence, the audible click can only be heard
once. The Glock design does not produce multiple clicks with repeated trigger pulls on an
empty chamber since it is striker-fired, not double-action. Sound effects are sometimes
added to films and television shows in order to make it sound as if a character wielding a Glock
is pulling the trigger several times, apparently unwilling to accept the fact that their
weapon is out of ammunition.



  ka-BOOM! or kB! Controversy



Coined by firearms reporter Dean Speir, [8] a kB! (or kaBoom!) [9] is the term used to describe
the explosive malfunction of a firearm, with usually costly, and often painful, results.
Glock pistol kB's usually damage the firearm, with no injury or minor injury to the shooter.

Controversy arose over Glock's safety standards when several instances of explosive
malfunction occurred in Glock pistols sold to police departments in the United States. [10]
[11] Upon pulling the trigger, the cartridge case would rupture and cause an explosion that
would tear apart the gun and sometimes send fragments into the shooter's face.

The cause of this malfunction was traced to issues with a purposely oversized (loose), and
partially unsupported chamber in Glock's pistols chambered in .40 S&W , .45 ACP , and 10 mm . The
chamber lacks full support in the rear by the feed ramp in order to facilitate feed
reliability. The lack of support in the chamber, usually combined with lead bullets ,
reloaded ammunition, or poor-quality factory ammunition, would cause the case to fail. The
subsequent rapid expansion of gas into the chamber caused the cartridge casing to expand
beyond normal specifications near the feed ramp at which time the casing would rupture,
sometimes damaging the polymer frame and usually ejecting the magazine downwards out of the
pistol grip.

Glock, in its own defense, says that the manual that accompanies each pistol informs the
shooter of the dangers of using non-factory rated ammunition, and that the firearm will
function safely if the shooter uses factory-loaded, jacketed ammunition and properly
cleans and cares for the firearm. [12] Supporters also point out that kB!s occur in other
firearms as well, [13] [14] particularly M1911 -type pistols. However, there continues to be
controversy over the presence of an unsupported chamber, critics arguing that it is not
necessary and is a liability for the company.

It has been stated that because of the specific design of the polygonal rifling in the Glock
pistol, operators should not shoot non-jacketed lead ammunition. Lead residue can quickly
build up, decreasing the bore diameter and create a dangerous over-pressurization in the
barrel, leading to structural failure or warping in the chamber of the barrel. [12] One can
notice a bulge in the fired case ejected from the pistol (even with target loads) to see the
result of the unsupported chamber.

A contributing factor may be that, on some models at least, the slide return spring is not
strong enough to ensure that the slide returns to full battery after a round is fired, when the
shooter has a "limp wrist" instead of a firm grip. This can be overcome by proper training.

Despite the controversy, Glock pistols still continue to be popular among military and law
enforcement agencies worldwide. Indeed, their extreme popularity and widespread use
likely contributes to the number of incidents reported involving Glock pistols.

There is no "Glock 40" model, but the term is sometimes used to refer to models chambered in .40
S&W.

Glock 18/18C pistols are 9 mm Luger select fire automatic/semi-auto machine pistols and not
available to the general public in most countries.

Glock 25 or 28 pistols are not available to the general public in the United States, as they do
not meet the standards required for the importation of pistols under the Gun Control Act of
1968 . This failure is not due to any inherent defect in the model, but due to the fact that a small
pistol chambered for the .380 ACP cartridge does not meet the "sporting purposes" criteria by
which imported pistols are judged. However, the Glock 25 and 28 pistols are relatively
popular in nations where handguns in "military" calibers (.45 ACP, 9mm Parabellum) may not be
purchased by the general public. Quick Reference Grid Standard Compact Subcompact Tactical

Leaving Lavan's House before it falls    

                     This is a short post before Shabbat to answer some questions on
where is Lavan's house. There are two countries whose flags are red, white, and blue on which
the white prevents the red from uniting as one. Those two countries are the United States and
Great Britain. The red on the flags is Edom. The white is either the pure and decent people that
make up the country which prevent Edom from completely devouring Ya'akov in the countries, or
it is Lavan the Aramean who also desires to devour Ya'akov. The blue is both the Ya'akov that
lives there in exile and the desire of both countries to have the blessings that G-d bestowed on
ancient Israel. Now that America's national version of former Louisianna Governor Huey
Long, former President Bill "Dog Face" Clinton, has served his full eight year term, the white
on America's flag now fully represents the "House of Lavan" with whom Edom must unite in
America in order to be elected. While the two Gogs that have been elected are surely from the
House of Edom (Gog Sr. as Esau himself and Gog Jr. as Eliphaz, his son). Slick Willy was surely
from the House of Lavan, maybe the reincarnate of the old slickmeister himself. (Thank you to
Rush Limbaugh for the nickname Slick Willy.) Now that the Hilly Billy show wants to return to
the White House in the person of Ov and Yidoni expert, Hillary Clinton, who communes with the
souls of Eleanor Roosevelt and other prehistoric feminists, the House of Lavan wants to
return to power in the White House (the House of Lavan).



It is now time to leave the protection of the House of Lavan on Ya'akov Avinu's two year journey
home. The descending value of the gurgling dollar will make it more and more difficult to leave
the guilded American cage. It is now gurgling because in the Spring of the 20th year of Ya'akov
Avinu's presence in the House of Lavan, he was told to go home. It took him two years to get there,
but he started on his way that fateful Spring. Twenty years ago the first Intafada broke on the
world scene during the last declining year of the Reagan Administration. Gog Sr. as VP took
control of his ailing from Alzheimer's disease boss's foreign policy to use the Intafada as a
whip against the Jews of the Holy Land. A year later the gilgul of Esau himself, Gog Sr., became
President and immediately recognized Yassir Arafat as the "elected" ha ha leader of the
peaceful Palestinian oppressed folk. When Ya'akov wanted to leave Lavan's house six years
earlier, Lavan himself informed him that a significant amount of Lavan's fortune came from
Ya'akov Avinu's presence in his midst. When Ya'akov left Lavan's house, Aram became a second
rate economic power. By the time the Hilly Billy show or the Barack Obama show comes to power in
America, this could very well be America's fate again.



The dollar is gurgling. The shekel because it is so dependent on the American broken reed will
also gurgle, but as we approach Esau and Amalek (Gog W. as Eliphaz and the Euro and Iran as
Amalek) one more time to escort them to Mount Seir for their final judgement, starting this
Fall after Yom Kippur, the eye of HaShem will rest on the Land of Israel with his Divine
protection forever. Amen!

The Fall of the House of Lavan    

                    

I spoke with Reb Lazer Brody today. I told him about my writer's block, and how I have swung from
one situation of high anxiety to another over the last month. He has set me straight with a
strong dose of emunah and bitachon (faith and trust in HaShem ). Somehow everything that is
pressing on me at this time will work itself out if I connect to the Infinite. I have decided to
press onwards before people start pelting me with stones for my absence. I have decided to
press onwards, but first of all I want to apologize to my readers for my delays in writing. I have
promised, and I have not delivered. I will try to rectify this now. I am going to the States for
three weeks in about ten days to visit my family. What a time to be going, just before the onset of
the intensification of Gog UMagog here in Eretz Yisrael . During that three week hiatus I will
hardly be able to write anything extensive. So I better write now.



The principle thing to remember at this time is that our greatest key towards success during
our final teshuvah efforts before the world turns topsy - turvey is emunah and bitachon . It is
the key to happiness when so much that we think that we can control is turning upside down. It is
also the key to our ultimate ability to function on all of our cylinders when the external
circumstances in our lives do not go our way and spiral out of our control. I will try to
implement this more on a personal level and remind others that as chaos begins to reign even in
"stable" America, you will need to start functioning like Israelis who live with chaos on a
daily basis. For instance, we are now in the throes of one our annual rites of passage, this
year's week-long postal strike. As the dollar continues to plummet, I am sure that Americans
will soon need to adjust to their new Israeli life-style. Better do it with emunah and bitachon
than do it like the unhealthy Israeli who does without such ties to his Creator.



Enough said. How has the Full Remembrance of Ya'akov affected you? You are probably saying
that it seems like nothing permanent has really changed. If you said this you would be really
wrong and out of tune with your spiritual environment. You might say that the British hostages
were let go, and the crisis with Iran petered out into a whimper. Yet, if you think for one minute
that the British are going back to life as it existed before the capture of their seamen, you
would be wrong. To understand what is happening we must consult the Zohar on this subject on a
page that this blogsite has often quoted before. Back toVaYera 119a.



Rav Shimon discusses the following verse:  'And I will remember my covenant with Ya'akov and
also my covenant with Yitzkhak , and also my covenant with Avraham will I remember, and I will
remember the Land (of Israel)' (Lev. 26:42).  "The name Ya'akov ," he said, "is written in
full with a letter Vav .  For what reason?  In the first place as an allusion to the grade of
Wisdom, the realm where Ya'akov dwells. But the chief reason is because the passage speaks of
the exile of Israel, intimating that the redemption of Israel will come about through the
mystic force of the letter Vav , namely, in the 6 th millenium , and, more precisely, after six
seconds and a half thereof.  In several previous writings including the Seceret of the Vav in
Hashem's name , I discussed with you how that year was 5666 (1906), more precisely on the
Seventh Day of Pesach after noon.  The historical event of that year was the establishment of
Seudat HaMashiach on the last day of Pesach , which outside the land of Israel is the eighth day
of Pesach .  This establishment was by the Rebbe Reshab of Lubavitch .

"GUN CONTROL"

  Nine Myths About

Gun Control

Nine Myths About Gun Control

www.2asisters.org

    4-20-7

        * Myth #1 "Guns are only used for killing"  

    

         

    

        Compared to about 35,000 gun deaths every year, 2.5 million   good Americans use
        guns to protect themselves, their families, and their   livelihoods - there are 65
        lives protected by guns for every life lost   to a gun - five lives are protected per
        minute - and, of those 2.5 million   protective uses of guns, about 1/2 million are
        believed to have saved lives.   [2]  

    

         

    

        * Myth #2 "Guns are dangerous when used for protection"  

    

         

    

        US Bureau of Justice Statistics show that guns are the   safest and most effective
        means of defense. Using a gun for protection   results in fewer injuries to the
        defender than using any other means of   defense and is safer than not resisting at
        all. [3] The myth that "guns   are only used for killing and the myth that "guns are
        dangerous when   used for protection melt when exposed to scientific examination
        and data.   The myths persist because they are repeated so frequently and
        dogmatically   that few think to question the myths by examining the mountains of
        data   available. Let us examine the other common myths.  

    

         

    

        * Myth #3 "There is an epidemic of gun violence"  

    

         

    

        Even their claim of an "epidemic of violence is   false. That claim, like so many
        other of their claims, has been so often   dogmatically repeated that few think to
        question the claim by checking   the FBI and other data. Homicide rates have been
        stable to slightly declining   for decades except for inner city teens and young
        adults involved with   illicit drug trafficking. We have noticed that, if one
        subtracts the inner   city contribution to violence, American homicide rates are
        lower than in   Britain and the other paragons of gun control. [2]  

    

         

    

        The actual causes of inner city violence are family disruption,   media violence,
        and abject poverty, not gun ownership. In the inner city,   poverty is so severe that
        crime has become a rational career choice for   those with no hope of decent job
        opportunities. [4]  

    

         

    

        * Myth #4 "Guns cause violence" Homicide  

    

         

    

        For over twenty years it has been illegal for teens to   buy guns and, despite such gun
        control, the African American teenage male   homicide rate in Washington, DC is 227
        per 100,000 - 20 times the US average!   [5] The US group for whom legal gun ownership
        has the highest prevalence,   middle-aged white men, has a homicide rate of less
        than 7 per 100,000 -   about half of the US average. [6]  

    

         

    

        If the "guns-cause-violence theory is correct why   does Virginia, the alleged
        "easy purchase source of all those illegal   Washington, DC guns, have a murder rate
        of 9.3 per 100,000, one- ninth   of DC's overall homicide rate of 80.6? [7 ]Why are
        homicide rates lowest   in states with loose gun control (North Dakota 1.1, Maine
        1.2, South Dakota   1.7, Idaho 1.8, Iowa 2.0, Montana 2.6) and highest in states and
        the district   with draconian gun controls and bans (District of Columbia 80.6, New
        York   14.2, California 12.7, Illinois 11.3, Maryland 11.7)? [7] The "guns-  
        cause-violence and "guns exacerbate violence theories founder. Again,   the
        causes of inner city violence are family disruption, media violence,   and abject
        poverty, not gun ownership.  

    

         

    

        Accidents  

    

         

    

        National Safety Council data show that accidental gun   deaths have been falling
        steadily since the beginning of this century and   now hover at an all time low. This
        means that about 200 tragic accidental   gun deaths occur annually, a far cry from
        the familiar false imagery of   "thousands of innocent children. [8]  

    

         

    

        Suicide  

    

         

    

        Gun bans result in lower gun suicide rates, but a compensatory   increase in suicide
        from other accessible and lethal means of suicide (hanging,   leaping, auto
        exhaust, etc.). The net result of gun bans? No reduction   in total suicide rates.
        [3] People who are intent in killing themselves   find the means to do so. Are other
        means of suicide so much more politically   correct that we should focus on measures
        that decrease gun suicide, but   do nothing to reduce total suicide deaths?  

    

         

    

        * Myth #5 The "Friends and Family fallacy"  

    

         

    

        It is common for the public health advocates of gun bans   to claim that most murders
        are of "friends and family". The medical   literature includes many such false
        claims, that "most [murderers]   would be considered law abiding citizens prior to
        their pulling the trigger"   [9]and "most shootings are not committed by felons or
        mentally ill   people, but are acts of passion that are committed using a handgun
        that   is owned for protection." [10]  

    

         

    

        Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic   homicide are a minority of
        homicides, [11] but the FBI's definition of   acquaintance and domestic homicide
        requires only that the murderer knew   or was related to the decedent. That dueling
        drug dealers are acquainted   does not make them "friends". Over three- quarters of
        murderers   have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and
        other   "acquaintances," but also against their relatives. [12,13,14,15]  
        Oddly, medical authors have no difficulty recognizing the violent histories   of
        murderers when the topic is not gun control - "A history of violence   is the best
        predictor of violence." [16] The perpetrators of acquaintance   and domestic
        homicide are overwhelmingly vicious aberrants with long histories   of violence
        inflicted upon those close to them. This reality belies the   imagery of "friends
        and family" murdering each other in fits   of passion simply because a gun was
        present "in the home."  

    

         

    

        * Myth #6 "A homeowner is 43 times as likely to   be killed or kill a family member as an
        intruder"  

    

         

    

        To suggest that science has proven that defending oneself   or one's family with a
        gun is dangerous, gun prohibitionists repeat Dr.   Kellermann's long discredited
        claim: "a gun owner is 43 times more   likely to kill a family member than an
        intruder." [17] This fallacy   , fabricated using tax dollars, is one of the most
        misused slogans of the   anti-self-defense lobby.  

    

         

    

        The honest measure of the protective benefits of guns   are the lives saved, the
        injuries prevented, the medical costs saved, and   the property protected not
        Kellermann's burglar or rapist body count. Only   0.1% (1 in a thousand) of the
        defensive uses of guns results in the death   of the predator. [3] Any study, such as
        Kellermann' "43 times"   fallacy, that only counts bodies will expectedly
        underestimate the benefits   of gun a thousand fold. Think for a minute. Would
        anyone suggest that the   only measure of the benefit of law enforcement is the
        number of people   killed by police? Of course not. The honest measure of the
        benefits of   guns are the lives saved, the injuries prevented, the medical costs
        saved   by deaths and injuries averted, and the property protected. 65 lives
        protected   by guns for every life lost to a gun. [2]  

    

         

    

        Kellermann recently downgraded his estimate to "2.7   times," [18] but he
        persisted in discredited methodology. He used   a method that cannot distinguish
        between "cause" and "effect."   His method would be like finding more diet drinks in
        the refrigerators   of fat people and then concluding that diet drinks "cause"
        obesity.  

    

         

    

        Also, he studied groups with high rates of violent criminality,   alcoholism, drug
        addiction, abject poverty, and domestic abuse . From such   a poor and violent study
        group he attempted to generalize his findings   to normal homes. Interestingly,
        when Dr. Kellermann was interviewed he   stated that, if his wife were attacked, he
        would want her to have a gun   for protection.[19] Apparently, Dr. Kellermann
        doesn't even believe his   own studies.  

    

         

    

        * Myth #7 "The costs of gun violence are high"  

    

         

    

        The actual economic cost of medical care for gun violence   is approximately
        $1.5-billion per year [20]- less than 0.2% of America's   $800-billion annual
        health care costs. To exaggerate the costs of gun violence,   the advocates of gun
        prohibition routinely include estimates of "lost   lifetime earnings" or "years
        of productive life lost" -   assuming that gangsters, drug dealers, and rapists
        would be as socially   productive as teachers, factory workers, and other good
        Americans - to   generate inflated claims of $20-billion or more in "costs." [20]  
        One recent study went so far as to claim the "costs" of work   lost because workers
        might gossip about gun violence. [21]  

    

         

    

        What fraction of homicide victims are actually "innocent   children" who strayed
        into gunfire? Far from being pillars of society,   it has been noted that more than
        two-thirds of gun homicide "victims"   are drug traffickers or their customers.
        [22,23] In one study, 67% of 1990   homicide "victims" had a criminal record,
        averaging 4 arrests   for 11 offenses. [23] These active criminals cost society not
        only untold   human suffering, but also an average economic toll of $400,000 per
        criminal   per year before apprehension and $25,000 per criminal per year while in
          prison. [24] Because the anti-self-defense lobby repeatedly forces us to  
        examine the issue of "costs," we are forced to notice that, in   cutting their
        violent "careers" short, the gun deaths of those   predators and criminals may
        actually represent an economic savings to society   on the order of $4.5 billion
        annually - three times the declared "costs"   of guns. Those annual cost savings are
        only a small fraction of the total   economic savings from guns, because the $4.5
        billion does not include the   additional savings from innocent lives saved,
        injuries prevented, medical   costs averted, and property protected by guns.  

    

         

    

        Whether by human or economic measure, we conclude that   guns offer a substantial
        net benefit to our society. Other benefits, such   as the feeling of security and
        self-determination that accompany protective   gun ownership, are less easily
        quantified. There is no competent research   that suggests making good citizens'
        access to guns more difficult (whether   by bureaucratic "red tape," taxation, or
        outright bans) will   reduce violence. It is only good citizens who comply with gun
        laws, so   it is only good citizens who are disarmed by gun laws. As evidenced by  
        jurisdictions with the most draconian gun laws (e.g. New York City, Washington,  
        DC, etc.), disarming these good citizens before violence is reduced causes   more
        harm than good. Disarming these good citizens costs more - not fewer   - lives.  

    

         

    

        * Myth #8 "Gun control will keep guns off the street"  

    

         

    

        Vicious predators who ignore laws against murder, mayhem,   and drug trafficking
        routinely ignore those existent American gun laws.   No amount of well-meaning,
        wishful thinking will cause these criminals   to honor additional gun laws.  

    

         

    

        Advocates of gun control rarely discuss the enforceability   of their proposals,
        an understandable lapse, since even police state tactics   cannot effectively
        enforce gun bans. As evidence, in Communist China, a   country whose human rights
        record we dare not emulate, 120,000 banned civilian   guns were confiscated in one
        month in 1994.[25]  

    

         

    

        Existent gun laws impact only those willing to comply   with such laws, good people
        who already honor the laws of common decency.   Placing further impediments in the
        path of good citizens will further disproportionately   disarm those good people -
        especially disarming good, poor people, the   people who live in the areas of
        highest risk.  

    

         

    

        If "better" data are forthcoming, we are ready   to reassess the public policy
        implications. Until such time, the data suggest   that victim disarmament is not a
        policy that saves lives.  

    

         

    

        What does save lives is allowing adult, mentally competent,   law- abiding citizen
        access to the safest and most effective means of protection   - guns. [26,27]  

    

         

    

        Brady I and Brady II  

    

         

    

        The extremists at Handgun Control Inc. boast that "23,000   potential felons" [28]
        [emphasis added] were prevented from retail   gun purchases in the first month of
        the Brady Law. Several jurisdictions   have reviewed the preliminary Brady Law
        data which resulted in the initial   Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF)
        overestimated appraisal   [29] of the "success" of the Brady Law.  

    

         

    

        The Virginia State Police, Phoenix Police Department,   and other jurisdictions
        have shown that almost every one of those "potential"   felons were not felons or
        otherwise disqualified from gun ownership. Many   were innocents whose names were
        similar to felons. Misdemeanor traffic   convictions, citations for fishing
        without a license, and failure to license   dogs were the types of trivial crimes
        that resulted in a computer tag that   labeled the others as "potential" felons.
        [30] In transparent   "governmentese," BATF Spokesperson Susan McCarron avers,
        "we   feel [the Brady Law has] been a success, even though we don't have a whole   lot
        of numbers. Anecdotally, we can find some effect." [31]  

    

         

    

        Even if the preliminary data had been accurate, that   data only showed about 6.3% of
        retail sales were "possible" felons   - consistent with repeated studies showing
        how few crime guns are obtained   in retail transactions. A minuscule number of
        actual felons has been identified   by Brady Law background checks, but the US
        Department of Justice is unable   to identify even one prosecution of those felons.
        [32 ] In such circumstance,   the minimal expected benefit of the Brady Law
        diminishes to no benefit   at all. The National Institute of Justice has shown that
        very few crime   guns are purchased from gun dealers. 93% of crime guns are obtained
        as   black market, stolen guns, or from similar non retail sources. [28] Since  
        none of Handgun Control Inc.'s Brady I or Brady II suggestions impact on   the source
        of 93% of crime guns, their symbolic nostrums cannot be expected   to do anything to
        reduce crime or violence.  

    

         

    

        Residential gun dealers  

    

         

    

        The press and broadcast media have vilified low-volume   gun dealers,
        pejoratively named "kitchen table" dealers, yet   the claim that such dealers are
        the source of a "proliferation of   guns on our streets" is contradicted by data from
        the Bureau of Alcohol,   Tobacco and Firearms (BATF). Those data show that 43% of gun
        dealers had   no inventory and sold no guns at all. [33 ]In fact, Congressional
        testimony   before enactment of the Firearms Owner Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA)
        documented   that the large number of low-volume gun dealers is a direct result of
        BATF   policy. Prior to FOPA the BATF prosecuted gun collectors who sold as few   as
        three guns per year at gun shows, claiming that they were unlicensed,   and
        therefore illegal, gun dealers. To avoid such harassment and prosecution,  
        thousands of American gun collectors became, at least on paper, licensed   gun
        dealers. Now the BATF and the anti-self-defense lobby claim BATF does   not have the
        resources to audit the paperwork monster it created. Reducing   the number of gun
        dealers will only ensure that guns are more expensive   - unaffordable to the poor
        who are at greatest risk from violence, ensuring   that gun ownership becomes a
        privilege of only the politically connected   and the affluent.  

    

         

    

        Instead of heaping more onerous restrictions upon good   citizens or law-abiding
        gun dealers who are not the source of crime guns,   is it not more reasonable - though
        admittedly more difficult - to target   the real source of crime guns? It is time to
        admit the futility of attacking   the supply of legal guns to interdict the less than
        1% of the American   gun stock that is used criminally. Instead, we believe effort
        should focus   on targeting the actual "black market" in stolen guns. It is  
        equally important to reduce the demand for illicit guns and drugs, most  
        particularly by presenting attractive life opportunities and career
        alternatives   to the inner-city youth that are overwhelmingly and
        disproportionately   the perpetrators and victims of violence in our society.  

    

         

    

        * Myth #9 "Citizens are too incompetent to use guns   for protection"  

    

         

    

        Nationally good citizens use guns about seven to ten   times as frequently as the
        police to repel crime and apprehend criminals   and they do it with a better safety
        record than the police. [3] About 11%   of police shootings kill an innocent person -
        about 2% of shootings by   citizens kill an innocent person. The odds of a defensive
        gun user killing   an innocent person are loss than 1 in 26,000.[27] Citizens
        intervening   in crime are less likely to be wounded than the police.  

    

         

    

        We can explain why the civilian record is better than   the police, but the simple
        truth remains - citizens have an excellent record   of protecting themselves and
        their communities and NOT ONE of the fear   mongering fantasies of the gun control
        lobby has come true.  

    

         

    

        "Treat cars like guns"  

    

         

    

        Advocates of increased gun restrictions have promoted   the automobile model of
        gun ownership, however, the analogy is selectively   and incompletely applied. It
        is routinely overlooked that no license or   registration is needed to "own and
        operate" any kind of automobile   on private property. No proof of "need" is
        required for automobile   registration or drivers' licensure. Once licensed and
        registered, automobiles   may be driven on any public road and every state's
        licenses are given "full   faith and credit" by other states. There are no waiting
        periods, background   checks, or age restrictions for the purchase of
        automobiles. It is only   their use - and misuse - that is regulated.  

    

         

    

        Although the toll of motor vehicle tragedies is many   times that of guns, no
        "arsenal permit" equivalent is asked of   automobile collectors or motorcycle
        racing enthusiasts. Neither has anyone   suggested that automobile
        manufacturers be sued when automobiles are frequently   misused by criminals in
        bank robberies, drive-by shootings, and all manner   of crime and terrorism. No one
        has suggested banning motor vehicles because   they "might" be used illegally or
        are capable of exceeding the   55 mph speed limit, even though we know "speed kills."
        Who needs   a car capable of three times the national speed limit? "But cars have  
        good uses" is the usual response. So too do guns have good uses, the   protection of as
        many as 2.5-million good Americans every year.  

    

         

    

        Progressive reform  

    

         

    

        Complete, consistent, and constitutional application   of the automobile model
        of gun ownership could provide a rational solution   to the debate and enhance
        public safety. Reasonable compromise on licensing   and training is possible.
        Where state laws have been reformed to license   and train good citizens to carry
        concealed handguns for protection, violence   and homicide have fallen.
        [11,26,27] Even unarmed citizens who abhor guns   benefit from such policies
        because predators cannot determine in advance   who is carrying a concealed
        weapon.  

    

         

    

        Fear mongering and the gun control lobby  

    

         

    

        In opposing progressive reforms that restore our rights   to self- protection, the
        anti-self-defense lobby has claimed that reform   would cause blood to run in the
        streets, that inconsequential family arguments   would turn into murderous
        incidents, that the economic base of communities   would collapse, and that many
        innocent people would be killed [26,27] In   Florida, the anti- self-defense lobby
        claimed that blood would run in the   streets of "Dodge City East," the "Gunshine
        State"   --- but we do not have to rely on irrational propaganda, imaginative
        imagery,   or political histrionics. We can examine the data.  

    

         

    

        Data, not histrionics  

    

         

    

        One-third of Americans live in the 22 progressive states   that have reformed laws
        to allow good citizens to readily protect themselves   outside their homes.
        [26,27] In those states crime rates are lower for   every category of crime indexed
        by the FBI Uniform Crime Reports. [11]   Homicide, assault, and overall violent
        crime are each 40% lower, armed   robbery is 50% lower, rape is 30% lower, and
        property crimes are 10% lower.   [11] The reasonable reform of concealed weapon
        laws resulted in none of   the mayhem prophesied by the anti-self-defense lobby. In
        fact, the data   suggest that, providing they are in the hands of good citizens, more
        guns   "on the street" offer a considerable benefit to society - saving   lives, a
        deterrent to crime, and an adjunct to the concept of community   policing.  

    

         

    

        As of 12/31/94, Florida had issued 188,106 licenses and   not one innocent person
        had been killed or injured by a licensed gun owner   in the 6 years post-reform. Of the
        188,106 licenses, 17 (0.0001%) were   revoked for misuse of the firearm. Not one of
        those revocations were associated   with any injury whatsoever. [27] In opposing
        reform, fear is often expressed   that "everyone would be packing guns," but, after
        reform, most   states have licensed fewer than 2% (and in no state more than 4%) of
        qualified   citizens. [27]  

    

         

    

        Notwithstanding gun control extremists' unprophetic histrionics   , the
        observed reality was that crime fell, in part, because vicious predators   fear an
        unpredictable encounter with an armed citizen even more than they   fear
        apprehension by police [34] or fear our timid and porous criminal   justice system.
        It is no mystery why Florida's tourists are targeted by   predators - predators are
        guaranteed that, unlike Florida's citizens, tourists   are unarmed.  

    

         

    

        Those who advocate restricting gun rights often justify   their proposals "if it
        saves only one life." There have been   matched state pair analyses, crime trend
        studies, and California county-   by-county research [27] demonstrating that
        licensing law-abiding, mentally-competent   adults to carry concealed weapons
        for protection outside their homes saves   many lives, so gun prohibitionists
        should support such reforms, if saving   lives is truly their motivation.  

    

         

    

        The right  

    

         

    

        Importantly, the proponents of the automobile model of   gun ownership fail to note
        that controls appropriate to a privilege (driving)   are inappropriate to a
        constitutional right (gun ownership and use). Let   there be no doubt. The Supreme
        Court has repeatedly acknowledged an individual   right to keep and bear arms. [35]
        It is specifically the "weapons   of war" - militia weapons - that are protected. The
        intent of the   Second Amendment was to ensure that, by guaranteeing the individual
        right   to arms, a citizen militia could always oppose a tyrannical federal
        government.   That the Supreme Court has acknowledged the right, but done little to
        protect   that right, is reminiscent of the sluggishness of the Supreme Court in  
        protecting other civil rights before those rights became politically
        fashionable.   Need we be reminded that it has taken over a century for the Supreme
        Court   to meaningfully protect civil rights guaranteed to African Americans in  
        the Fourteenth Amendment?  

    

         

    

        Besides Second Amendment guarantees of the pre-existent   right to keep and bear
        arms, there are Ninth, [36] Tenth, [35] and Fourteenth   Amendment, [37] as well as
        "natural right" [38] guarantees to   self-protection.  

    

         

    

        Since 1980, of thirty-nine law review articles addressing   the Supreme Court case
        law and history of the right to keep and bear arms,   thirty-five support the
        individual right view and only four support the   "collective right only" view [39]
        (and three of these four are   authored or co-authored by employees of the
        anti-selfdefense lobby). One   would never guess such a legal and scholarly
        mismatch from the casual misinterpretations   of the right in the medical
        literature and popular press. The error of   the gun prohibitionist view is also
        evident from the fact that their "collective   right only" theory is exclusively an
        invention of the twentieth century   "gun control" debate - a concept of which
        neither the Founding   Fathers nor any pre-1900 case or commentary seems to have had
        any inkling.  

    

         

    

        California and Concealed Weapons  

    

         

    

        California has been studied and we discover that the   counties that have the lowest
        rates of concealed weapon licensees have   the highest rates of murder and the
        counties with the highest rates of   concealed license issuance have the lowest
        rates of murder. [27]  

    

         

    

        It has also been noted that current California law gives   considerable discretion
        to police chiefs and county sheriffs regarding   the issuance of Concealed Weapon
        Licenses. Particularly in urban jurisdictions,   abuse of that discretion is
        common. The result? In many jurisdictions only   the affluent and politically
        connected are issued such licenses. In California   few women and virtually no
        minorities are so licensed, even though poor   minorities are the Californians at
        greatest risk from violence.  

    

         

    

        Conclusion  

    

         

    

        The police do not have a crystal ball. Murderers, rapists,   and robbers do not
        schedule their crimes or notify the police in advance,   so the police cannot be
        where they are needed in time to prevent death   and injury. They can only arrive
        later to count the bodies and, hopefully,   apprehend the predators.  

    

         

    

        There have been state-by-state analyses, county-by-county   research, and crime
        trend studies. All the research shows that allowing   good citizens to protect
        themselves outside their homes is a policy that   saves lives. The anti-self
        defense lobby advances many proposals in hopes   that it will "save only one life."
        Reform of concealed carry   laws is a policy that saves many lives, so it is a policy
        that should be   supported by the gun control lobby, if saving lives is really their
        interest.  

    

         

    

        Will Stockton base its policy on experience and sound   data? or will Stockton fall
        prey to misinformation, fear, prejudice, and   imaginative false imagery? [40]  

    

         

    

        We beg you. Let Stockton's good citizens protect themselves,   their loved ones,
        and their livelihoods. The ordinance before you costs   no money and it will save
        many lives.

GERMANY



With a chilling warning, Germany renewed its call for the remilitarization of Europe.



After World War ii lay claim to 50 million lives, the idea of a European community was supposed
to ensure such aggression would not be witnessed again. Instead, the primary aggressor in
that war is using that idea to reorder Europe to its liking. To increase the pressure on
less-influential European states, Germany is once more threatening war in Europe unless
efforts toward unifying the Continent continue.



Germanyâ€™s Angela Merkel told Bild on March 23, â€œWe should not take peace and
democracy for granted. The ideal of European unification is still today a question of war and
peace.â€� Merkel bluntly highlighted one of the initial purposes for what is today the
European Union: to bridle German militarism.



But along with her call for pressing forward with still greater European integration, Merkel
called for a pan-European military: â€œIn the European Union we have to come closer to the
creation of a European army.â€�



What Merkel envisions for Europe is far grander and more potent than the 60,000
multi-national Eurocorps currently on hand. The European Unionâ€™s Eurocorps falls
far short of being the truly globally potent military that Germany has wanted for some time.



A leaked 2003 German military planning document obtained by Britain (published in the
Telegraph , Oct. 24, 2003) explained that â€œa European army legitimized and financed by
the European Parliament is the visionary goal of Germany policy.â€� German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer once told Britainâ€™s Guardian newspaper,
â€œTransforming the European Union into a single state with one army, one constitution
and one foreign policy is the critical challenge of the age â€Š.â€�



Why does Germany want to abolish national armies and build one super-European army?



Consider: No single EU member state can match American military expenditures on its own.
America spends 3.7 percent of every tax dollar on defense; most European states spend 2
percent or less. Thus, Germany has suggested that all EU member states pool their national
resources. German leaders believe that if EU member states pooled their national budgets
together, the Continent could dramatically improve its military capabilities. The 2003
document, for example, included such provisions as building a centralized military
command, having the military report to the European Parliament, building joint defense
systems, and integrating nuclear arsenals (which would be French and British) into European
defense.



Certainly, Germany wants to build an economic and military power out of the European Union. It
has already played an important role in foisting the euro onto Europe; now it wants full
political union. But for the European integration project to truly be able to project its
power on the global scene, it also needs a strong European army.



This is truly a visionary goal. Already it has some high-profile supporters among EU nations
outside of Germany. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi embraced the concept;
current Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi once said â€œthe EU should have its own army
from countries which accept a common defenseâ€�; outgoing French President Jacques
Chirac once said â€œthe European Union cannot fully exist until it possesses autonomous
capacity for action in the area of defense.â€�



However, interestingly, Merkelâ€™s call for a European army comes at a time when Europe
doesnâ€™t have a democratic mandate from the European people. Not only that, the
challenge of building a European army is made greater by the absence of a European
constitution authorizing such a pooling of autonomous national resources within Europe.



Nevertheless, these kinds of realities have never stood in the way of European and German
ambitions to unite Europe. Without public support, any effort by Germany to proceed with
building the institutions outlined within the failed constitution demonstrates its lack of
respect for Europeâ€™s democratic underpinnings. Still, Europe continues to build as
if it is one mega-superpowerâ€”a United States of Europeâ€”without legal
undergirding.



The architects of European integration clearly plan to continue pushing for assimilation.
The track record of successfully building Europe without a mandate shows that Germany will
most likely succeed in its course. It has been Europeâ€™s standard protocol to first
build an institution, and then, once built, put a law on the books acknowledging its reality.



Soon enough, Europeans will be startled to find out that they have an empire on their hands,
complete with all the trappings. However, they will also be startled to realize that they are
no longer Frenchmen, Poles, Spaniards and Austrians, but members of a third German-led
empire.



Truly, with France and Britainâ€”two lynchpin powers Europe has so often counted on to
counterbalance German ambitions in Europeâ€”as feeble as they are today, the rise of
Germany within Europe is assured.



Watch for Germany to continue to push for its visionary goal in Europe: a powerful united
super-European army. Also watch for Germany to bully its way into control of its military
command and decision-making, and even potentially to become a de facto nuclear power by
gaining control of French nuclear bombs.

Liberator on display in the Invalides

The FP-45 Liberator was a pistol manufactured for the United States military during World War
II .

The pistol was designed for the United States Army in 1942 by the Inland Guide Lamp
Manufacturing Division of the General Motors Corporation in Dayton, Ohio . Interestingly,
the army designated the weapon the Flare Projector Caliber .45 hence the designation FP-45.
This was done to disguise the fact that a pistol was being mass produced. The original
engineering drawings label the barrel as "tube", the trigger as "yoke", the firing pin as
"control rod", and the trigger guard as "spanner". The Guide Lamp Division plant in Anderson,
Indiana assembled a million of these weapons. The Liberator project took about 6 months from
concept to end of production with about 11 weeks of actual manufacturing time, done by 300
workers.

The weapon was a crude, single shot pistol designed to be cheaply and quickly mass produced .
The Liberator had just 23 parts. The weapon largely used stamped and turned steel parts that
were cheap and easy to manufacture. The weapon fired a .45 caliber pistol cartridge from an
unrifled barrel. Due to the unrifled barrel, maximum effective range was only about 25 feet
(less than 8 meters). In reality, the actual effective range was closer to about 10 feet (3
meters). After that, the oblong .45 ACP bullet (designed for a rifled barrel) would begin to
tumble out of control ("keyholing").

The Liberator was shipped in a cardboard box with 10 rounds of .45 ACP ammunition, a wooden
dowel to remove the empty shell casing, and an instruction sheet showing how to load and fire
the weapon. Excess rounds of ammunition could be stored in the pistol grip.

After production, the Army turned the Liberators over to the OSS . A crude and clumsy weapon,
the Liberator was never intended for front line service. It was originally intended as an
insurgency weapon to be mass dropped behind enemy lines to resistance fighters in occupied
territory. The resistance fighters were to recover the weapons, sneak up on an Axis occupier,
either kill him or knock him out and retrieve his weapon(s). Many resistance fighters called
the FP-45 "a great weapon to get another one with".

The weapon was valued as much for its psychological warfare effect as its actual field
performance. It was believed that if vast quantities of these weapons could be delivered into
Axis occupied territory, it would have a devastating effect on the morale of occupying
troops. The plan was to drop the weapon in such great quantities that occupying forces could
never capture or recover all the weapons. It was hoped that the thought of thousands of these
unrecovered weapons potentially in the hands of the citizens of occupied countries would
have a deleterious effect on enemy morale.

In reality, the OSS never saw the practicality in mass dropping the Liberator over occupied
Europe , and only a handful were ever distributed. Only the Chinese and resistance forces in
the Philippines received the Liberator in any significant quantity. The Liberator was never
issued to American or Allied troops and there is no known instance of the weapon ever actually
being used in combat.

The original delivered cost for the FP-45 was $2.10/unit ($26 in 2005). A Liberator in good
condition today can fetch approximately $2500, with the original box bringing an additional
$1500, with an original extremely rare paper instruction sheet the value could exceed $4500
to a collector of World War II rare militaria.

An interesting fact about the Liberator is that the factories could produce one faster than
the weapon could be loaded and fired. Building the pistol took about six or seven seconds
whilst loading took about 10 seconds.

The Liberator was replaced with the Deer gun in the 1960's.
