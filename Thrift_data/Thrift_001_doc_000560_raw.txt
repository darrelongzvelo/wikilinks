"Bending Over Backwards"... A Simplified Version of the New FHA Credit Score Guidelines...



Although I agree that having an excellent local Realtor, of course, is incredibly
important... there is nothing quite as valuable, besides that, for a buyer to have during the
purchase of their home... than a knowledgeable, professional loan officer.

It used to be that when getting an FHA loan... before all of the current mortgage mess... that
all of the lenders would "bend over backwards..." offering easy qualifying guidelines, and
incredibly "imaginative," and perhaps fraudulent, ways of obtaining FHA financing.



Image: /image_store/uploads/6/9/7/0/0/ar128417839600796.jpg

Those days are gone.   No more "bending over backwards" for lenders.

With that in mind, I have seen several explanations detailing some of the many changes to FHA
financing that have already taken place, and some that WILL take place... effective October
4, 2010.

Many of those explanations have been involved and very difficult to understand.

So... here is a simple and brief run-down of what can have the biggest impact on whether or not
our buyers get loan approval if they pursue FHA financing.  And by the way... I have been using
FHA financing for many, many years with my buyers, and give it my highest recommendation.

Credit Scores:

Buyers with a credit score over 580... are eligible to apply for maximum borrowing power...
maximum financing... with a minimum of 3.5% down payment.  Depending on other factors, they
may or may not be approved.

Buyers with a credit score between 500 and 579 are eligible to apply for FHA financing, but
will be required to put a minimum of 10% of the purchase price... as their down payment.  The
lenders call this limiting the loan to a 90 percent LTV... or a ninety-percent loan-to-value
ratio.  Depending on other factors, they may or may not be approved.

Buyers with a credit score below 500... are not eligible for FHA-insured mortgage financing.

The main rumor that was scaring both Realtors and buyers, and sellers as well, was that if a
buyer had a credit score below 580... that they could no longer get FHA financing.  If that had
been true... it would have had a MAJOR impact on both buyer financing in particular, and on the
real estate market in general.  Whew !

It is possible for them to obtain this financing... depending on many other "mitigating"
factors.  Like reserves, job stability, source of down payment, and lots of other stuff.

--------------------

To My Loan Officer Friends:   This is meant to be a "simplified" presentation of the value...
positive or negative... of certain ranges of credit scores. 

Nowhere... in anything that has been written here... did I say that someone with a 501 credit
score would be approved.  I know that.  This was not meant to be "misleading."  It was meant
to be an overview, a brief simplified version.  A place to start.

And... even though the scores I quoted may have been "acceptable" to the FHA... sure, the great
majority of lenders would not take these loans unless the buyers had a ton of offsetting or
mitigating factors.

If I wanted to, I could have written fifteen hundred words on this subject.   I am familiar with
a great deal of the underwriting guidelines, and I understand that most other Realtors are
not.  that is why the words "Simplified Version" appear in the title.

The FHA guidelines do not tell lenders what loans they MUST accept.  They tell lenders what
loans they "could" accept... and still have them be within the FHA Guidelines.

Jennifer:  I could have gone on for pages and pages... but why ?  I do have a pretty good grasp
of all of the new regulations, and of the old ones, as well.  But most Realtors don't want to
hear about it.  They just want a quick way of getting a decent idea of whether or not their buyer
is "financable."  This does it.

Jennifer... you are both very kind in your comments, and very, very welcome.  Have a great
weekend. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home Hunters of Fort Worth and

Karen Anne,  I appreciate your easy to understand explanation, it is very helpful.

Debbie:  As you saw from the post, the lower the credit score, the more down payment
required.  The score... of 500, for example, is a starting point.  From there...
everything else is weighed... and the overall risk is measured.  With a score of only 500...
the buyer must show, after all info is in, that there are other "compensating factors" that
balance out, and strengthen the loan. 

For example... if somehow the buyer had personally "saved" the ten percent down payment... it
weighed heavily on the plus side.  If they had been simply given that money by parents... even
though they then HAD the down payment, it was not seen as anywhere NEAR the positive
compensating factor as it would have been if they had saved it themselves.

OK... I got off track.  Back to "the stuff."

Loans are approved or rejected on the basis of one thing, and one thing, only.  Risk !  The
lender puts together the complete package on the borrower... and gets a complete picture. 
Just like getting a diagnosis from a doctor.

After all the preliminary work is done, the lender simply steps back, looks at "the big
picture"... and must decide if the risk to lend to that loan applicant, is worth the money they
will make on the loan... and the probability that the borrower will perform... that is, make
the payments.

If this post gets some "activity"... I think I will write several more posts on the simplified
process of getting a loan approved.  I have always felt, that as a Realtor, that it was
critical that I know my mortgage financing.  And, with that in mind, I had NO problem
whatsoever asking a buyer about their financial information. 

And, you must know, from what you have seen from me so far, that the only way anyone can dare ask
about that stuff... is if that buyer... is "relaxed" with you, and now feels she knows you,
likes you, and trusts you.  Basically, that is my starting point. Fort Worth Real Estate - - -

Karen Anne - I have to say, you really are good at explaining things so thoroughly.
 Everything you explained in the comment box is exactly what was going through my mind - so I
wonder just how many lenders these days are willing to take that risk?  The point of the
borrower saving or not saving the down is a good point but there had to be a lot going on to get that
500 score too (or not going on)  

I'm not in any way saying I'm against the idea.  I just find it interesting that FHA would even
contemplate this with all the trouble fannie mae and freddie mac are having today.  Just a
thought. Debbie Atwood (Century 21 Real Estate Center Everett, WA) 2:37am • #14

Karen this is a very straightforward account of the FHA changes. I agree lenders should not
overcomplicate the explanation of changes in the lending world.

Although FHA will insure loans down to 580 score most lenders actually require a 620.

FHA is a good tool in our tool belts for buyers - many agents have been confused about the
guidelines so this should clear that up (at least for those that read it).  Do you remember the
days when people had to have good scores, money down and a job - before it all went nuts.  Of
course people should have a job, good credit and some money down.  Just makes sense! Anna

Karen, you gave a very accurate description of the new FHA guidelines. The problem is these are
more restrictive than before this latest memo when FHA had no minimum credit score.
Regardless of what FHA says you will have a very difficult time finding a lender who will go
below 620. I hear of some lenders that promise they can go to 580 but I'm not sure I believe that.

From an FHA lenders standpoint nothing has changed in regard to credit score. Of course the
new MIP changes are going to impact all of us, with the higher payments.

Thanks for your article.

Karen-Anne, thanks for the detailed explanation. It does make sense the way you described it.
However, I am of the same mind thatWayne and Jay are. Most lenders that I know won't even
consider anything under 580, so if there are examples of people actually closing a loan with
that scores under 580, then that would be a plus... William James Walton, Sr. Greater

Hi Karen Anne - I agree with Wayne's comment just above.  The fact that FHA loans are not credit
score driven has meant nothing over the past few years because of lenders placing their own
overlays on the product.  And I'm not sure they will relax those overlays any time soon.  But
it's good to know where HUD stands because there may come a day when the 580 score borrower will
be able to obtain an FHA loan.  Tchaka Owen (Keller Williams Realty) 3:50pm • #27

Karen.. sure, this is simple to read... but why a loan officer should explain this in more
detail. You state this..

"Buyers with a credit score between 500 and 579 are eligible for FHA financing, but will be
required to put a minimum of 10% of the purchase price... as their down payment.  The lenders
call this limiting the loan to a 90 percent LTV... or a ninety-percent loan-to-value ratio."

As much as this statement is true, if I had written this post, I would have added an important
reminder... Consumers, be very careful on those that can say that they can do under 580.. I
haven't seen it happen in over 2 years.  I know a few lenders up to 6 months ago had this, but they
still didn't close these.

In regards to credit scores from 580 to 600... Yes, there are a few that can do this... but the
rate is any where from 1% to 1 1/2% higher with usually 1 to 2 points more. So my point to that is
that I would again put out an important message.. Hey, anyone promising you FHA loans under
600, even under 620, be very very leery. Yes, they have guidelines that allow them to originate
these loans, and not only are they more costly, they are harder to close.. the guidelines are
more complicated and require more than anything above 620. There are a few reasons to this...

Don't get me wrong, you put the correct info out there.  But with no warning labels.  So as a
consumer, which is how I also look at posts such as these, I would think.. hey honey, we can get a
FHA loan with 3.5% down with our lousy 585 credit score.  And then the added problem, you will
have a loan officer that will use this to their advantage to bring them in the door, even though
they know they have really no shot in closing the loan. "It's called sticking crap on the wall,
hoping that it sticks."  You know how many e-mails or calls I get a month, from someone that was
told they could get a loan with under a 620, the loan officer said no problem, yet 2 months later,
they never closed..  more than I could count on 1 hand...  it happens and that is where we need
to educate within a post, and not just give the basics.. just my opinion.

Overall..  I just try to think in detail, because then borrowers put hope in their heads, and
then they find a loan officer that will drag that hope out.... it's sad, yet it happens.  And I
wrote about these same updates on 9/5/10, called FHA mortgage updates. I didn't want to link it
in my comment, unless you wouldn't mind. But please take a look at it, maybe it will give you an
idea of what I am talking about.  thanks

I agree with Jeff. Here locally we are seeing lender overlay's requiring a 620.  So while
technically you could, in theory, get an FHA loan, trying to find a real lender to do so is a whole
other ballgame.  I'm all about succint, but lender overlays are really important to talk
about as well.  If you know of someone in your local area that does them without the overlay, I
would post a link to them. Otherwise I can see consumers going crazy trying to find them. Melina

Karen Anne, Have to say that Jeff nailed it...the issue at hand remains in that ominous
mortgage lender's term "overlay".  FHA basic guidelines have little to do with what lenders
will underwriter as most are in a "CYA" mode.  I have no access to a lender who would finance a
500 credit score with a 10% down payment.

A 500 credit score with will get a consumer a "Uncle Guido" loan at 15% interest rate and 10
points up front and a maximum of 65% loan to value...and the loan documents will arrive in a
violin case. 

As a loan officer, one has to read All Regs...then proceed on to all of the exceptions each
specific lender is making.  Very, very difficult to categorically state anything one way or
another these days.

As a couple of others have mentioned, every lender has placed their own credit score minimum
overlay on top of the HUD guidelines.  In general, the Secondary Market has had a 620+ minimum
requirement for going on 2 years now.  This is even when FHA has no minimum credit score
requirement.  Until the Secondary Market relaxes the current minimum, these changes will
have zero impact from HUD's previous policy. Rodney Mason - FHA 203K/ USDA /VA / HomePath

Karen Anne:  I had a listing agent colleague ask me the other day why they should care about FHA
"rules ...."  With all the multiple-offer listings, the rules are strong indicators if you
have a real deal or if it just looks good on paper.  Thanks for the Reader's Digest version of
the scores - obviously individual circumstances are involved, but the "rule out" barrier is
lowered with the content of your post.  It's a lot better to be able to suggest to my seller
"This one is unlikely to close ..." and have some easy to understand written third-party

There is a misconception that FHA requires a 620 credit score now for a standard 3.5% down loan.
It's not true. FHA requires a 580 score. Unfortunately, you can't find many lenders who will do
one without the 620, so it's effectively the same. Agent Aaron | Jenna Gallen | Capitol Home

Looks like it is still not easy if possible at all to get a Lender to go that low. But times change
quickly, so we'll see.

Good topic of discussion. In general lenders have their own underwriting overlays. Sure HUD
will accept 580 or below credit score, but most lenders are already requesting a minimum of
620 FICO score. I agree with Jeff Belonger comments above.

In conlusion - if you have clients with below 620 FICO, recommend to have their scores fixed
first. Pacific Coast Financial LLC 10:31am • #40

Karen Anne,

Great Post and good comments here.  This is still a tough market to get the deal closed and to
know what the Buyer's options are.  I just send them to a mortgage person to explain what is out
there...because it probably changed 10 minutes ago. 10:37am • #41

Great work Karen:

 

I can easily understand what you wrote and it's a great starting point for counseling FHA
buyers.  Now, where do we find those buyers? 10:50am • #42

I have herd so many different versions of the requirements for the 580 and below.  I can't even
find a lender in my area offering any loans under 580.  Most say they don't have the software to
do it, do you know if the software will be released on Oct 4th?  I'm in a hard hit part of Florida,
were  a lot of "good people" had their credit scores affected mostly due to the buying frenzy
in 2005, and now have lost their investments. Would sure like t help them out. Thanks for your
insight! Effie Aultman 10:50am • #43

To My Loan Officer Friends:   This post is meant to be a "simplified" presentation of the
value... positive or negative... of certain ranges of credit scores. 

Nowhere... in anything that has been written here... did I say that someone with a 501 credit
score would be approved.  I know that.  This was not meant to be "misleading."  It was meant
to be an overview, a brief simplified version.  A place to start.

And... even though the scores I quoted may have been "acceptable" to the FHA... sure, the great
majority of lenders would not take these loans unless the buyers had a ton of offsetting or
mitigating factors.  But possibly someone, somewhere, perhaps under some rock... could
approve it.

And surely, there would have to be quite a few "mitigating" or "offsetting" factors. 
Lenders approve loans according to one criteria... "Risk."  So, if a borrower had a credit
score below 620, 0r below 580... yes, it would fall within the FHA parameters, but no, it would
probably not be approved by the great majority of FHA lenders.  Without, that is, many other
factors that might improve or lessen the risk.

Like... reserves.  I don't know if lenders still can require what we "oldie but goodie"
Realtors remember as being called "pledge" accounts, but IF... some lender wanted the buyer
to deposit say... one year of total PITI payment in a "pledged" account, that would certainly
lessen the risk.

Like... job stability and likelihood of continued employment.  If the buyer is in a shaky
employment field, and has no reserves, it is quite possible that this buyer would not be
approved.

If this buyer was going from a much higher payment, to a much lower payment... and the spread was
pretty great... that might be a "mitigating" factor... helping some lender somewhere to
accept the loan.

There are many other "mitigating" or off-setting factors that could sway some lenders to
accept the loan, when the majority of others would not.  The best answer is... "it all
depends."

The FHA said that such a score in the lowest category... 500 - 579... was "acceptable" to
them.  It did not say that approval was "probable."

The FHA sets the overall guidelines.  Different lenders then are able to "shrink" those
guidelines to fit their OWN corporate personalities and acceptabilities.

If I wanted to, I could have written fifteen hundred words on this subject.  Although I am
familiar with a great deal of the underwriting guidelines, I understand that most other
Realtors are not.  That is why the words "Simplified Version" appear in the title.

The FHA guidelines do not tell lenders what loans they MUST accept.  They tell lenders what
loans they "could" accept... and still have those loans be within the FHA Guidelines.

Prior to accepting payment to secure a credit report, determining the DTI is essential
because most buyers fail to qualify because they exceed the DTI ratios.

These GSE's will be reformed next year, so with mandatory federal and state licensed
mortgage loan officers (MLO), consumers will have a choice to work with a licensed or
registered MLO. A registered MLO isn't required to take federal or state license tests to
assist consumers in securing loans, so, whom would you recommend your client get a loan
from and why, a licensed or registered MLO? Kimo Jarrett, Realtor, Huntington Beach,

Peter in # 53:   What sweet things you say.  You obviously are a great judge of character...
<smile>  And, I am quite impressed that you are reading this all the way from Australia.  I
hope, in addition to the post at the top... you also read MY comment # 44 that attempted to answer
those lenders who chimed in adding lots of information, with said additions being true,
stretched this post past my intent of this, which as the title plainly said, was "s Simplified
Version."

My comment # 44 adds more detail about additional lending approval parameters, but again,
tries to do so in "Simplified" terms... aimed at Realtors who may do an EXCELLENT job, but who do
not normally get all that much "into" the "hairy'ness" of underwriting guidelines.

Again, Peter... thanks so much for reading this, and even more, thanks so much for
commenting.  Your comment is great evidence of the far-reaching'ness of Active Rain.

Karen,

Anyone who is in the business as long as I have knows that the FHA information you have provided
is HUGELY important. What lenders will do within those acceptable parameters changes over
time. Right now the lenders are MORE conservative than the guideline.  But we have just left
an environment where FHA was used less because the conventional lenders were more lenient
than FHA guidelines....much more lenient.

Agents need to know what the FHA guidelines are, because their clients may have read that
somewhere and ask the agent questions. Knowing the correct answer is always of value to an
agent. "Yes, what you have read, that you can have a score as low as 500, is correct as to FHA
printed and available guidelines. BUT local lenders do not have to, and largely do not, grant
loans on that basis." To be able to interpret the available information for a client is of
value. 

By reading this an agent might answer "Can I get a mortgage with a credit score of 540?" The
informed, intelligent answer is "Technically...yes. Realistically...not likely." :)
Then the prospective buyer will know that it will be an uphill climb and a long shot. But
sometimes the long shots win. Not often...but sometimes. 

Most agents don't like to waste their time on "long shots". I see that every day with short
sales. A young man came to me to buy a house after two other agents laughed at his stated goal.
Said it couldn't be done. He is now living in that home because I was not afraid of the long shot
and worked up a strategy for his success. Yes, it had a 5% chance of working. Yes, most agents
want a more solid basis than a 5% chance of working and don't like to waste their time. But
knowing everything there is to know...even though those professionals are few and far
between, often make the difference between the client's success and failure.

Thank you for providing the full, unedited, "rules" of the game!

Hi Karen,  It is a very good post and I appreciate the information.  However, not one person
has broached the possibility that a Buyer with such a low credit score might not be a good
candidate for purchasing a home.  Home ownership is a BIG responsibility.  In terms of the
future stability of the real estate market, the large number of people who are just walking
away from their homes is setting a precedent that may change our market forever.  Combine
that with the large number of people who have credit scores below 600 and I wonder if anything
will ever be the same again.  A philosophy teacher said to me years ago that "society has it own
momentum" and this latest change in thinking is taking us in a scary direction.  A good while
back a poster on AR said something that stuck with me.  She said her home was under water
but she would be staying in it and making the payments because she couldn't imagine doing
anything else.  She said she never expected the bank or anyone else to share in her homes
appreciation and the same was true of it's loss in value.  Since then, I've seen distressed
sales in the low end of our market increase to one in four listings.  By some estimates, it will
be one in two by next summer.  Those numbers point to a lot of folks buying homes who do not
share her ethical position and are likely, in many cases, just not in a position to do so.  I do
belive that home ownership is the American dream and should remain so but I also understand
that not everyone should buy a home.  Helping people do what doesn't make sense isn't help
at all.      Beverly Femia - Broker RealtorÂ® Stager - Greater Wilmington, NC Area

Neal & Katie in # 55:   Finally... someone who appreciates the intent of this post.  Huggs to
you, my new friends.  And... I just LOVE your opening greeting in your comment.  Thanks for
reading all those comments in addition to my post.  That is really the best way to get the most
out of a post like this.

My intent with this post was to share... not to try and get out my big intellectual guns and try to
impress.  I don't need to do that.  And... great analogy about the old suggested length of a
woman's skirt.

Honestly, I cannot tell you how much your "greeting" made me smile.  It "made" my morning.

Al at Ocean View in # 19:   Cool.  Someone else who understood that this was the "simplified"
version.  Yes... a few of the lenders who have commented on this post can give AWESOME
explanations of FHA guidelines and conditions... but yes, it puts many readers to sleep, and
often "loses" many of their readers who get barely into their complicated explanations, get
frustrated, and quit reading.

Dan Hansmeier at "Rochester" in # 61:   I looked at your website, and see that the "Rochester"
is Rochester, Minnesota.  I believe that folks there are usually much more conservative in
MN than in many other areas of the US population, so I am not surprised that your two local
mortgage brokers might be working their tails off getting buyers approved with lower, but
still FHA-acceptable credit scores, than might lenders in other more "dice-rolling"
markets.

It makes sense... and for me, your "typical buyer" and their more conservative nature, might
fall into what I called the "mitigating factors" category.  Thanks for the comment, which
adds weight to the intent of my post. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home

Markita in # 20:   Actually, the FHA new guideline say that FHA will "insure" loans with lower
scores.  The trick is to find buyers with scores like that... but with enough mitigating
factors that lenders will also accept them.  As you know, the funds... the money for the
loan... does not come from the FHA.  It comes from the lender, and/or their investor. Fort

Anna Banana in # 21:   Things still need to make sense.  They just need to make a whole lot
more sense than they used to.  Funny how often... that sooner or later... the "old" becomes
"new" again.

Loans have always been approved according to the risk level of the buyer.  Then, the goofy
lenders started taking all sorts of crazy risks, or did not even pay attention to the degree of
risk.  Congress pushed through a relaxing of loan oversight... thanks to folks like Dick
Cheney pushing lender deregulation... but that all came back to bit us ALL in the
you-know-where. 

Now, we see an "over-compensation" swing of that pendulum.  Things will again ease a tad, but
it will take time. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home Hunters of Fort Worth

enough to be able to put my own big toe in my own "toddler's mouth."  Jeez... if I could only
remember what I did yesterday.

Funny how the lenders commenting on this post just ran away with stuff... and ignored the
"simplified" intent I plainly stated.

Due to the "tsimis"... I think that is the correct spelling of the Lithuanian word for
"hubbub"... that brought the "flavor" of so many of the lender's comments... I think I will
write another post about "mitigating circumstances" than can strengthen the viabiliby of
lower-credit-score buyers.

Karen,

 A well simplified blog about the FHA program. I think however that you should have expanded
on the mortgage reqirements to obtain this type of financing. Bob Amato of Empire Home

Karen... I keep reading your comments.... and the intent or not, simplified or not, us lenders
aren't missing the point of this post. As mentioned by many, your simplified post could have
mentioned some details as we have mentioned.  Sorry, but this kind of information makes it
sound like some of these kinds of FHA loans can be done. Yes, FHA says they can, but not one lender
will do a FHA loan with credit scores under 580. That is a fact now... and this post makes it a tad
misleading, because it's not mentioned.. this is your simplified version but consumers and
realtors reading this will think it can be done.. and search for it. I know you want to help and
had no intentions... and you might never comment on my posts again... but this should not be put
out there to the public. You can still have a simplified version with some explanation. As I
mentioned, I just wrote about this today.  thanks

Karen,Your post and the comments that followed points out the very big gap in what HUD intends
for borrwers and what the HUD approved lenders actually do for them.

to simplify even more add the following.

* Lenders may require higher scores and additional conditions. See you local FHA loan officer
for specifics.

None of my FHA lenders will touch any borrowers with a score less than 620, so this new FHA ruling
really does not matter much. Of course there are a few lenders out there that will work with a sub
580 borrower..pulling teeth with these lenders and clients if you ask me. Time to focus on
quality buyers with quality profiles who in turn will get approved with quality lenders, as
this will make all of our jobs and worlds a little easier. Thanks for the information and post, I
see you get a lot of blogs posted on here, good for you :)

Jeff Belonger in # 78:   I am glad you are re-commenting, because I was just about to respond to
your first comment in # 29.

I will not give you the same copied and pasted" response I have given to four folks... just above
this comment/response.

Actually, it was YOUR original post... your lengthly, and excellent explanation of the new
FHA guidelines... that inspired me to write this post.

You are incredibly knowledgeable, and I am sure you are excellent at your craft.  However...
there are so many folks who "might" start reading your "treatise"... which, is a good word, but
in the way that I am using it, I am also being mildly sarcastic here... folks might... after
wading through all the technical stuff... become so "snowed under..." that they simply give
up reading any further.

This post was meant for those folks. 

I tried to put in several "disclaimers" as to the existence of "mitigating factors"... and
again, I was not even trying... to duplicate the scholarly intent of your typically
very-well-written posts.

As you probably know, there are many agents "out there" who don't even get into qualifying
guidelines to the extent that my "simplified version" was written.  I have often heard
Realtors say to their buyers... when the buyers asked them about such basic things as
"mortgage payments"... I have heard them say... "Oh, I don't get into that.  I just give you
the name of three loan officers to call."

I understand that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, and I also see the doubt that can
form in a buyer's mind when it appears their Realtor doesn't even know enough about financing
to even talk "basics" with them.  THOSE are the folks for whom this post was written.

My point of view here... is that the opinion that this post is "a tad misleading" is in the eyes of
the reader/beholder.  I have inserted many disclaimers about there being other things
involved in getting the loan approved... and statements about "mitigating factors" as well.

Jeff... I don't think my above post was misleading... especially for folks... agents... who
actually took the time to read it, and understand what I was saying.

I will check out your post that you just wrote today.  I am curious about whether you refer to
this post or not.

By the way... our "back and forth" here should not and will not preclude me from "ever
commenting on your posts again."  My heart and brain do not work that way.  We simply have
conflicting opinions.  Having conflicting opinions, and then reading the opinions of
others, and "taking it all in"... is how we "grow."  Again... have a Great Sunday.

By the way... this post was intended to be a "public post" and will remain that way.  But, I
appreciate your concern. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home Hunters of Fort

Karen...  one thing, you didn't add those disclaimers until after some of the comments left
by loan officers. Hey, I appreciate the disclaimers.. but if we didn't ciomment, would there
have been any disclaimers then?  I did see the update and do appreciate it.  It's how we all
grow and learn.

In regards to mentioning your post when I wrote mine.. at first didn't... because I didn't want
anyone to think that I was slamming you.  You did a good job in what you wrote... but I think it
needed to be explained in more detail. I know this post was written for the consumer, which is my
main problem and concern. Sorry, but I will still disagree with the simplified version and
state that it can be misleading... It wasn't that your post had wrong information, but that it
was missing explanation to what can and can't be done.

overall... your statements above make it sound liked these types of loans can be done, because
of FHA says so in their guidelines. But the fact of the matter, the reality is that credit scores
under 580 can't be done right now. Scores betwee 580 to 619... extremely difficult. As I
mentioned, I get many e-mails from borrowers who were promised these such loans and 2 to 3
months later, they were denied.   All the lenders that I have seen do loans with credit
scores from 580 to 619 want 10% down, even though FHA says it can be done with 3.5%.  I just
think, even in a post such as this, that this needs to be mentioned.

As far as myself mentioning your post, if you don't want it mentioned, just let me know. Again, I
don't want people to think that I am bashing your post or trying to be negative... and that some
might not read my whole post that you talked about.. sorry, but boring or not, I think consumers
will read the whole post. it's some of the realtors on AR or in general that don't read the whole
post.  Their loss.. consumers want good accurate information and not part of the picture...
thanks for your feedback and input.

As with most of the mortgage guidelines coming out of Washington these days - the banks CAN, but
it doesn't mean they WILL.

The best thing a prospective buyer can do is get busy on raising those credit scores. Much as I
dislike the banks, I can't really say I blame them for not wanting to do a repeat of the mortgage
crisis by lending to folks who are poor money managers. Marte Cliff (Marte Cliff Copywriting)

about the same or less you can qualify. Gene Riemenschneider East Contra Costa Home Sales

Karen Anne- A very thought (and comment) provoking post. For the last several years I
have recommended and worked with one mortgage broker. I introduce my Buyers who aren't
pre-qualified to her and then let them work out the financing. She tells me how much the Buyers
can offer and off we go to find a suitable property. She stays current on her regulations and
rules and I stay up to date on mine. I handle the real estate and the mortgage broker handles the
financing. This division of labor works well for both of us. BTW, she has qualified
several Buyers who have been rejected by loan officers at big banks. It's amazing what one can
do when their income is dependent on their production.    Mike

Jay in # 34:   I very much appreciate your concern about my health.  The tests I took made my
Cardiologist even more suspicious and concerned.  He wants to do a bunch of blood tests...
and then perhaps a cardiac catheterization if the results of the blood tests show that is
feasible... before making a definitive judgment.  I do, however, think I know what he has
in mind, and I will follow up with you in a private email.

I so appreciate your concern.  My own daughter hasn't even asked... <dorky, crinkled smile>

Gary in # 36:   The lenders MUST continue to tighten the screws.  I think what we are seeing now
regarding the stringent lender overlays on top of the FHA Guidelines... is a sign that the
pendulum has over-swung the middle-ground... and has gone on to being probably overly
strict.

As we veterans know, that is what usually happens.  Then, after time, the pendulum swings
back towards the middle again. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home Hunters of

Jane in # 37:   Not exactly.  With a score as low as 500... and up to 579... the number of hoops
and super-strong mitigating factors a buyer MUST have to even have a glimpse of a chance to get
approved by the lender... considering their "overlays..." is quite huge.  Obviously, the
lower the credit score goes... downward... from 579... the closer to impossible it gets.

For a buyer with such a credit score... although the FHA says they will "accept" the loan if the
lender approves it, the lender overlays must be considered.  And, with the lenders having
been burned so badly over the last four years... the lower the score, the closer to impossible
it can get.

In mortgage financing... the only "sure thing" is that there is NO "sure thing." Fort Worth

Aaron in # 38:   Yes, essentially it IS the same thing.  See Dan's comment in # 61, and my
response in # 64 about the scarcity and the value of having a lender who can, and has decided to
work within the FHA Guidelines... and has a less stringent lender "overlay" on top of the FHA
Guidelines. 

Plain and simple... if the risk is assumed to be too high because of circumstances other than
the credit score, the lender can, and will, decide to make other, more stringent requirements
to act as mitigating factors for the negatives in the buyer's case. Fort Worth Real Estate - - -

Jon in # 39:   Correct.  Lots of mitigating factors will have to be present to make up for what

Jayne in # 41:   I agree.  But, it is always a good idea for us, as Realtors, to have a decent
"working knowledge" of current mortgage requirements so we can at least look acceptably
knowledgeable to our clients... both buyers and sellers.

And yes... depending on the individual lender you are working with... things COULD have
changed ten minutes ado. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home Hunters of Fort

Mystery commentor in # 42:   Thanks so much.  I thought so... although so many of my lender
friends are "rainin' down" on me and my post.  LOL.

Cool... you read the post.  I wish some others read it as thoroughly.  Yes, this is a
"starting point."  Now, where do we find those buyers ?  In what some others call their
"sphere of influence..." which I call my "sphere of relationships." 

Referrals are always the best source, regardless of what ANYBODY says about other sources. 
Blogging is also an excellent source.  Joe Stumpf and his By Referral Only organization is
the one "trainer" I recommend. 

Some say Brian Buffini, but I have taken Buffini's Mentoring course, and am a Buffini
Certified Mentor, but even so, I recommend By Referral Only and Joe Stumpf over Buffini. Fort

Effie with Coastal Realty Group in # 42:   I honestly wonder if software isn't the
problem.  What I am guessing is... that they are saying they cannot feed YOUR buyer info into
their "automatic approval software"... whatever it is called (need some lender help here
with the name of the software)... and get an automatic approval.

It may be their OWN software prepared by their lender.  Remember... it is the individual
LENDER who makes the approval.  They can, and DO have stricter requirements... often called
a "lender overlay"... which, as one might guess, sits on top of the FHA Underwriting
Guidelines.

Not sure here, but I am guessing that it is the software of individual lenders.  (Jeff ?)

I very much appreciate your "very human" situation regarding a lot of "good people."  Some of
those buyers just might have some very good personal financial "mitigating factors" that
could serve to offset their short sale or foreclosure histories, but I am sure that so many
lenders around you have been burned... prolly more like "incinerated" by the current
mortgage mess... and just, as a corporate policy, cannot and will not touch these buyers.

And... with the last word you used... "investments"... that can make a difference.  If the
home in question was the buyer's actual residence... and they lost it through short sale or
foreclosure... that is one thing.

If that home home was "an investment"... perhaps a "spec" home that they tried to buy and hold as
an additional investment, and then ended up losing it... that is another matter entirely, and
not "can be" but "will certainly be" a major problem... and may make it impossible for them to
get a loan for from three to seven years... depending on other parameters.

I checked Active Rain, and see you are in the Port St Joe area southwest of Tallahassee... right
on the ocean... and am guessing there have been a lot of short sales there... perhaps from
"investment" homes.  Ouch !

I hoped some of this helped.  Take care... I wish you and your clients the best. Fort Worth Real

Kimo in # 45:   Yes, the DTI... debt to income ration... is essential.  And I am guessing that
even though the credit score may be acceptable, if the debt to income ratio is outside the
Guidelines, the loan is rejected.

Not sure what you mean by a GSE.  Did you mean GFE... Good Faith Estimate ? 
Anyway... obviously, the more qualified the mortgage loan officer is, the better. Fort

Woody in # 46:   Simplified version... as contrasted with a "so overly technical and
complicated, and full of mortgage industry lingo that most buyers or Realtors give up reading
it about a third of the way through, if they make it that long" version.  <nasty smile>

My guess is that as long as you are bring a buyer that ONLY meets minimum standards, and does NOT
have any super-strong offsetting factors to balance against those "minimum items"... you
will have a tough time getting buyers approved.

I have dealt with FHA financing since way back in the early 1970's.  If anyone things things
are "interesting" now... you shouldda been there in 1973... LOL.

By the way... the significant down payment... over and above the FHA minimums for that
particular credit score category... would be what I am calling "mitigating factors" or
offsetting factors.

For example... one question would be whether or not a buyer with a credit score of 579 would be
approved if they had 50% down ?  Well, if that were the case, they probably would not be going
after FHA financing in the first place. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home

ARDELL in # 57:   Wow... if only everyone were this knowledgeable.  Excellent comment. 
What you have to say, and your willingness to take on the "long shot" buyer who was told by two
other Realtors laughed at... says volumes about you.

Sounds like me... <smile>  There is such a great feeling to be able to take someone who has had
their visions of their own home-owning dreams made fun of... and then have the "motherly
patience" to take them, hold their hands, and of course, have the extensive knowledge to know
exactly what to do with them.

What a great feeling to help make those types of buyer's dreams come true.  You sound like an
ANGEL of a Realtor.  I already knew you knew your stuff... but now I know you also "care."

It's that old, but very true saying... "I don't care how much you know... until I know how much
you care."  My compliments to you, Young Lady.  <smile>

Beverly in # 58:   I wrote a post last November 8, 2010 titled "When was the Last Time you
Counselled a Buyer, and Suggested they Continue Renting ?" 

 Right now I am in Internet Explored and don't know how to put the link into this comment for
it.  My Firefox, which I normally, is not working properly... so I cannot give you the link. 
I will try to do it later... and then continue my comment to you.

But... in short, yes... there ARE times when a Realtor must, in acting in their fiduciary
capacity for their client/buyer... must recommend that they do not purchase.

It is just, for that buyer, the right thing to do.

I believe most lenders are taking issue with this statement: "The main rumor that was scaring
both Realtors and buyers, and sellers as well, was that if a buyer had a credit score below
580... that they could no longer get FHA financing.Â  If that had been true... it would have
had a MAJOR impact on both buyer financing in particular, and on the real estate market in
general.Â  Whew !" I think they're just trying to point out that it's NOT a rumor - it IS true -
and it shouldn't have ANY impact because minimum scores were already higher than these
increased HUD minimums. A vital subject and one we all should understand. Thank you for

Peter in Perth, Australia # 68:   You are very welcome.  And I do agree, that all
economies are connected. 

And, to slightly paraphrase the poet John Donne from his "Devotions upon Emergent Occasions
"... Meditation XVII in 1624... "no woman or man is an island... all of us are pieces of the
whole."  

And then the remainder of that quote by John Donne... "any man's death dimishes me, because I am
involved in Mankinde ; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for
thee."

Peter, you are getting quite philosophical on me, my friend.  Yes... as you said, "the global
economies are all connected, and our commen success of failure will effect us all."

Michael in # 81:   Only focusing on "quality buyers with quality profiles" ends up ignoring
the tough-to-qualify buyers that ARDELL so eloquently speaks about in her comment # 57, and in
my response in # 104.

I think a nice mixture is the more "human" way to go... at least that's the way I do it.  I may not
have as long of a list of closings as you at the end of the month, but I know I have made some great
folks very and often tearfully happy by helping them make their dreams come true.

So... to use your words... pull some teeth with those clients and lenders.  You just proved my
point.  Yes, there ARE some lenders "out there."  You might list them here in an additional
comment, as many folks commenting here have all but said those lenders do not exist.  Bingo !

Gene in # 85:   It was all so simple way back then.  But, then again... if you failed to pay the
rent, you were evicted.  If you failed to pay your mortgage, you lost your home, your credit,
and who knows what.  Also, owning that same home brings along with more expenses than does
simply renting it.

Mike in # 86:   First of all, thanks for your kind words.  It sounds like you have an excellent
partnership working between you, your buyers, and your mortgage broker.

That she is willing to work with some of the "tough ones..." and has gotten approvals for buyers
who have been rejected by other loan officers... further proves one of the points of this
post... as far as mitigating factors are concerned.

To add to your last sentence... yes, it is amazing what one can do when their income is dependent
on their production, and when they "know their stuff," and when they know how to work hard
enough to find answers where others thought they did not exist.  Excellent.  By the way,
keep that lender hidden.  She is a prize. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home

Jana at Kings Mortgage in # 108:   It appears that several commentors have said
that they have gotten sub-580 buyers approved... so I guess it goes back to BEING a rumor. 

Also, with you being in California, and with the overwhelming short sale and foreclosure
problems there, and the large amount of investor buyers who have lost their homes, it is no
wonder that the "lender overlays" are so harsh.

And... you are quite welcome. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home Hunters of

Carrie & Kathy in # 109:   Yes, it has been somewhat of a marathon.  And, you are quite
welcome.  By the way, if you have not done so already, try and read both the post, and all of the
comments.  It IS quite an education.  Take care... Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne

A top lender, with years of experience, especially with FHA and VA, is an absolute must, as a key
part of your team. I am so lucky to have found such a person. I've been using him since 1996.

As you know, sometimes buyers have already hooked up with a lender, before we meet. And
sometimes that makes me cringe!

But my guy has often rescued my buyers when "their" buddy had messed up the deal and the buyers
were in jeopardy of not getting their house.

You need to be choosey about who is on your "team", as it were. Jon Quist, ABR, CRS, ePRO, GRI

The government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are a group of financial services
corporations created by the United States Congress . Their function is to enhance the flow of
credit to targeted sectors of the economy and to make those segments of the capital market more
efficient and transparent. The desired effect of the GSEs is to enhance the availability and
reduce the cost of credit to the targeted borrowing sectors: agriculture , home finance and
education.

Congress created the first GSE in 1916 with the creation of the Farm Credit System ; it
initiated GSEs in the home finance segment of the economy with the creation of the Federal Home
Loan Banks in 1932; and it targeted education when it chartered Sallie Mae in 1972 (although
Congress allowed Sallie Mae to relinquish its government sponsorship and become a fully
private institution via legislation in 1995).

The residential mortgage borrowing segment is by far the largest of the borrowing segments in
which the GSEs operate. GSEs hold or pool approximately $5 trillion worth of mortgages.

Some of the GSEs (such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac until 2008) have been privately owned but
publicly chartered; others, such as the Federal Home Loan Banks , are owned by the
corporations that use their services.

GSE securities carry no explicit government guarantee of creditworthiness, but lenders
grant them favorable interest rates, and the buyers of their securities offer them high
prices. This is partly due to an "implicit guarantee" that the government would not allow such
important institutions to fail or default on debt. This perception has allowed Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac to save an estimated $2 billion per year in borrowing costs. This implicit
guarantee was tested by the subprime mortgage crisis , which caused the U.S. government to
bail out and put into conservatorship Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in September, 2008. Kimo

Kimo in # 124:   Thanks so much for your excellent explanation of GSE's.  I "knew" that was
what mannie and Freddie were call... I just could not put it together at the time of your
comment.

What I did NOT know... was all the rest of the information you provided... which is just
stunning.  I appreciate you taking that much time to share.  Thanks so much.

I am going to take some time, and treat your comment as if it were a "class" in GSE's... and learn
as much as I can from the links.  Again, thank you very much. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen

To all commentors:   Thank you all so much for your participation.  I have appreciated all of
your responses except one... the one that I felt was an attack.

After receiving a follow-up comment from that same person... it appears that the purpose of my
"Simplified Version" post has been fulfilled, and that anything further is not warranted. 

So, I am going to close this post for further comments.  Before I do that... I am going to also
delete that one... shall I say "over-stated" reader comment, and my response to it as well,
just to return the tone to "a better place"... and then put this "baby" in her crib and let her
drift off to sleep.

Thanks again.  I hope those of you, mostly Realtors, who took this post as it was intended...
as a "Simplified Version" type of post... found something of value in it.  Have a great week,
everyone. Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home Hunters of Fort Worth and
