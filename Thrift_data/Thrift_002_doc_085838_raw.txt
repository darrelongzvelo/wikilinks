26, '07 3:13 AM

for everyone

Braun   ( help Â· info ) ( German pronunciation "brown", not "brawn" as is frequently
mistaken in English) GmbH is a German consumer products company known for its clean
industrial designs. Beginning in the mid-1950s, the company's design staff began producing
household products with a functionalist designâ€”radios, slide projectors, audio
equipment, etc.â€”that are iconic of modern 20th century industrial production, and
are prized today as collectors' items.

From 1984 through 2005, Braun was a wholly owned subsidiary of The Gillette Company , which had
purchased a controlling interest in the company in 1967. Braun is now a wholly owned
subsidiary of Procter & Gamble , which acquired Gillette in 2005.



[ edit ] Products



    Braun's products include the following categories:

    - Shaving and Grooming (electric shaving, hair trimming, beard trimming)

    

    - Oral Care (now under the Oral-B brand)

    

    - Beauty Care (hair care and epilation)

    

    - Heath and Wellness (ear thermometers, blood pressure monitors)

    

    - Food and Drink (coffee makers, coffee grinders, toasters, blenders, juicers)

    

    - Irons

    

    - Clocks and Calculators (clocks for arms, tables, walls; calculators)

    



Formerly a manufacturer of high-quality radios, slide projectors, optical equipment, and
high-fidelity sound systems.

Germany 1958

Max Braun , an engineer , established a small engineering shop in Frankfurt am Main in 1921 . In
1923 he began producing components for radio sets. In 1928 the company had grown to such an
extent, partly due to the use of certain plastic materials, that it moved to new premises on
Idsteiner Strasse, Frankfurt .

Eight years after he started his shop, Max Braun began to manufacture entire radio sets in
1929. Soon after, Braun became one of Germany's leading radio manufacturers. This
development continued with the launch of one of the first combined radio and record players in
1932.

In 1935 the Braun brand was introduced, and the familiar logotype with the raised " A " took
form. At the 1937 World's Fair in Paris , Max Braun received the award For special achievements
in phonography . Three years later, the company had more than 1000 employees.

Braun continued to produce state-of-the art radios and audio equipment, and in 1956
introduced its now famous SK-4 record player. Braun soon became well known for its '
high-fidelity ' audio and record players.

The 1950s also marked the beginning of the product that Braun is most known for today: the
electric shaver . The S 50 was the first electric shaver from Braun. The shaver was designed in
1938, but World War II delayed its introduction until 1951. [1] It featured an oscillating
cutter block with a very thin, yet very stable steel-foil mounted above it. This principle is
still used in Braun's shavers of today.

From the mid-1950s, the Braun brand was closely linked with the concept of German modern
industrial design and its combination of functionality and technology. The most
influential designer at this time was Dieter Rams , a member of Braun's design staff. Rams was a
key figure in the German design renaissance of the late 1950s and 1960s, and a former teacher at
the Ulm Hochschule fÃŒr Gestaltung. Eventually becoming head of Braun's design staff,
Rams' influence was soon evidenced in many products. Braun's famous SK-4 record player and
the high-quality 'D'-series (D45, D46, D47) of 35mm slide projectors are some of the better
examples of Functionalist design. Another 'icon' of modern design, but less well known, is
the electrostatic loudspeaker unit LE1, the electronics were licenced from QUAD For nearly
30 years Dieter Rams served as head of design for Braun A.G. until his retirement in 1997. Many
of his designs - wonderfully sleek coffee makers, calculators, radios and razors - have found
a permanent home at the Museum of Modern Art .

In the 1970s, a design approach influenced by pop-art began to inspire Braun products, which
by this time included many common household appliances and products. Contemporary Braun
design of the period incorporated this new approach in bright colors and a lightness of touch,
while still clean-lined in keeping with Functionalist philosophy.

A controlling interest in Braun AG was sold to The Gillette Company in 1967 by the heirs of Max
Braun, complementing the razor offerings of that company. Braun became a wholly owned
subsidiary of Gillette in 1984; Gillette was in turn acquired by Procter & Gamble in 2005.

26, '07 3:04 AM

for everyone

Olay is a Procter & Gamble brand, based around a facial moisturizer skin care product.

History



[ edit ] Early days



Olay began life in South Africa as oil of Olay . Graham Wulff, an ex- Unilever chemist from
Durban started it in 1949 . The name "oil of Olay" was chosen by Wulff as a spin on the word "
lanolin ," a key ingredient.

It was unique in the early days because it was a pink fluid rather than a cream, packaged in a
heavy glass bottle. Wulff and his marketing partner, Jack Lowe, a former copywriter, had
tested the product on their wives and friends and were confident in its uniqueness and
quality.

Olay's marketing was also unique, since it was never described as a moisturizer, nor even as
beauty fluid. Nowhere on the packaging did it say what the product actually did. Print adverts
used copy such as "Share the secret of a younger looking you" and talked about the 'beauty
secret' of oil of Olay. Other adverts were written as personal messages to the reader from a
fictitious advice columnist named Margaret Merril. They ran in Readers' Digest and
newspapers and often looked like editorials.

Wulff and Lowe, who ran the company under the banner of Adams National Industries, did not sell
the product to the trade, but waited for pharmacies to ask for it based on consumer requests.

As the company began to market the product internationally, it was decided to modify the name
of the product in each country so it would sound pleasing and realistic to consumers. This led
to the introduction of oil of Ulay ( UK ), oil of Ulan ( Australia ) and oil of Olaz ( Netherlands )
(and Germany ). In 1970, ANI opened a test market in USA (Chicago), and was expanding into
northern Germany.



[ edit ] 1970 to 1985



    Richardson Merrell Inc (later Richardson-Vicks Inc) acquired ANI in Nov 1970. RVI:

    - capitalized the "Oil" and added the sub name 'Beauty Fluid' to help protect the trade
    mark

    

    - added a sales force

    

    - created TV advertising

    

    - added products such as Night of Ulay and Beauty Cleanser

    

    - expanded into more countries (Spain, France, Germany)

    



The result of Richardson Merrell's efforts was a dramatic increase in sales. However, as with
many brands, the business was not managed uniformly so there were differences between the
countries.



[ edit ] 1985 to 2005



RVI was acquired by Procter & Gamble in 1985. P&G greatly expanded Olay both in line up and in
countries. Olay became one of P&G's Billion dollar brands in 2003.

Since then, the range has been expanded to include a full range of hypoallergenic variants,
cleansers and creams with the aim of meeting the full range of skincare needs, whatever the
user's age or skin type. The brand also includs soap, and body wash. Olay Cosmetics was
launched in 1996 but discontinued in 2001.

In 1999 it was decided to unify the brand under a global name. Thus Oil of Ulan and Ulay became
Olay on a worldwide basis, except in German-speaking regions, where it remained Oil of Olaz .
In the Netherlands it was renamed just Olaz .



[ edit ] Today



The Olay brand has expanded into a range of other products grouped in "boutiques" including
Complete, Total Effects, Regenerist, Quench (North America), White Radiance (Asia) and
Olay Vitamins (USA). Olay is the market leader in many countries including USA, UK, Turkey and
China [1] . Olay has extended its heritage as a moisturizer to stay looking young, to formally
creating the "anti-aging" category in mass stores with the launch of Total Effects in 1999 .
The launch was almost double the typical price of a mass market moisturizer at the time. Today,
there are numerous products in market more expensive than Olay.

Olay Regenerist was the best performing anti-aging cream in a recent test done by a consumer
association. [2]

Olay's current slogan is "love the skin you're in". Tags: olay , p&g , artikel , article ,

Jul 26, '07 2:53 AM

for everyone



Image: http://www.pg.com/images/product_card/v3/zest/pb_logo_zest.gif Zest is a
synthetic detergent bar, produced by Procter & Gamble and marketed as deodorant bar that
leaves no "soap" film. It was first introduced in 1958 with the slogan "For the first time in
your life, feel really clean." The soap experienced an uptick in sales in the 1980s and early
1990s , with the advertising slogan "Zestfully clean!", coined by the BBDO sloganeer James
Jordan .

Commercials also talked about how soap leaves a sticky film that won't rinse away while Zest
doesn't. One commercial showed a teenage girl who used ordinary soap scratching her back
against a tree at bus stop. While still scratching, the bus shows up. Another commercial
featured NFL fullback Craig "Ironhead" Heyward promoting the Zest bodywash product.

Marbled in appearance, it originally came in two forms: the blue-green Aqua and the yellow
lemon-scented Citrus. The range now comprises Aqua Pure, Energy Fresh, Linen Fresh,
Ultimate Clean (said to offer antibacterial action), Spring Burst and Tropical Fresh, along
with three liquid body washes, Spring Splash, Morning Garden and Ocean Energy.

for everyone



Image: http://www.pg.com/images/product_card/v3/clairol/pb_logo_clairol.gif
Clairol is a personal care products division of Procter & Gamble and was formerly the largest
independent hair products company in the world. P&G-Clairol makes hair coloring , hair
spray, shampoo , hair conditioner , and styling consumables. Among their brand names are
Herbal Essences , Loving Care, Hydrience, Ultress, Natural Instincts, Nice 'n Easy, and
Balsam Color.

Clairol was founded in the 1930s by the husband and wife team of Lawrence M. Gelb and Joan Clair.
After discovering a European hair coloring preparation called Clairol, which produced
softer, more natural tones by penetrating the hair shaft instead of merely coating the hair,
the Gelbs introduced the product to American beauty salons. The real breakthrough came with
the introduction of Miss Clairol Hair Color Bath in 1950 and sales skyrocketed with the
introduction of do-it-yourself hair coloring Nice 'n Easy, aided by one of the most effective
advertising campaigns of the time, with the catchphrase, "Does she or doesn't she?"

In 1957, the Gelbs sold their company to Bristol-Myers Squibb and their sons Richard L. Gelb
and Bruce Gelb filled executive positions at that pharmaceutical company, with Richard
becoming CEO in the 1970s.

Bristol-Myers Squibb sold the Clairol division to Procter & Gamble in 2001.

Following the subsequent acquisition of Wella by P&G, Clairol expanded into the
professional sector of the hair care products business. P&G-Clairol is headquartered in
Stamford, Connecticut , United States of America .

On June 7, 2007 P&G announced that Clairol, now P&G Beauty, would be closing the Stamford, CT
site. The plant will be split between locations in MA and Mexico by 2010, and the
administration will be moving mostly to Cincinnati, OH by 2008. Tags: clairol , p&g , blog ,

ball Jul 26, '07 2:18 AM

for everyone

The Downy ball is a spherical plastic tool used to dispense liquid fabric softener in clothes
washing machines . Liquid fabric softener has to be added at the correct time to a load of
laundry in order to work effectively. The Downy ball got its name from the brand name that first
introduced its use and is also known by the names laundry ball and softener ball . Though the
name Downy ball implies that it can only be used with Downy brand products, other brands (such
as Snuggle , or Suavitel ) can be used with this product to achieve the same results.



[ edit ] Operation



The ball has a gasket on one side that has a small weight that hangs toward the center of the ball
and a ring, to pull the gasket closed, on the outside. Before starting a load of laundry, fabric
softener is poured through the opened gasket. There is commonly a line on the side of the ball to
show the correct volume of softener to use. The ring is then pulled to snap the gasket closed and
the ball is dropped on top of the laundry in the washing machine.

As the washing machine goes through its cycles the ball floats on top of the water. At the start
of the spin cycle, the ball, along with all of the clothing, is pushed out to the sides of the
rotating tub. The momentum of the ball and the properties of Newton's First Law cause the
weight inside the ball to pull the gasket open when the ball hits the side of the spinning tub.
With the gasket now open, the ball fills with water and sinks. The softener and the water are
able to mix and circulate through the tub to apply softener to the clothing at precisely the
right moment.

The ball cannot be used with front-loading washing machines. Tags: downy , ball , article ,

Birthday Helen Mirren! Jul 26, '07 2:00 AM

for everyone

Tak ke korang wish Happy Birthday kat Helen Mirren yang popular dengan filem The Queen tuh?
Sudah berusia 62 dowh...

Dame Helen Mirren , DBE , (born on July 26 , 1945 ) is an Academy Award -winning English stage,
television and film actress . She has also won four SAG Awards and assorted BAFTAs , Golden
Globes and Emmy Awards during her career.

Personal life

Mirren was born Ilyena Vasilievna Mironov [1] in Ilford , Essex , [2] now a part of Greater
London . She was the second of three children of a father of Russian origin and an English
mother. Mirren's paternal grandfather, a Russian nobleman, tsarist colonel and diplomat,
was negotiating an arms deal in Britain and was stranded there, along with his family, during
the Russian Revolution . Her father, Vasily Petrovich Mironov, called himself Basil and
changed the family name to Mirren in the 1950s. He played the viola with the London
Philharmonic before World War II and, after it, drove a cab and was a driving-test examiner.
Mirren's mother, Kathleen Rogers, was the thirteenth of fourteen children born to a butcher
whose father had been the butcher to Queen Victoria . Mirren considers her upbringing to have
been "very anti-monarchist". [3]

Mirren attended a Catholic girls' school, St. Bernard's High School , in Southend-on-Sea ,
and subsequently a teaching college in London . At age 18 she auditioned for the National Youth
Theatre and was accepted. By age 20 she was a star at the Old Vic .

Mirren married American director Taylor Hackford (her partner since 1986), in the Scottish
Highlands on 31 December 1997 , his 53rd birthday. It was her first marriage, and his second (he
has two children from his previous marriage). Mirren has no children and says she has "no
maternal instinct whatsoever." [4]

Her great-great-great-great-grandfather was the Russian field-marshal Mikhail Kamensky
, one of the heroes of the Napoleonic wars .

On 5 December 2003 , she was invested as a Dame Commander of the British Empire . When she
received the honour, Mirren commented that Prince Charles was "very graceful" but forgot to
give her half of the award, where another person had to remind him to give Mirren the star. She
also stated that she felt wary about accepting the award and had to be persuaded by fellow
comrades to accept the DBE. In 1996 she had previously declined a CBE. [5]



[ edit ] Theatre



Following appearances on stage during her school years at St Bernard's High School for Girls
in Westcliff-on-Sea , Essex , Mirren's first starring role was in 1965 as Cleopatra for the
National Youth Theatre . This led to her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company , playing
Castiza in Trevor Nunn's 1967 staging of The Revenger's Tragedy , Cressida in Troilus and
Cressida in 1968 and the title role in Miss Julie at The Other Place in 1971.

In 1972-73 Mirren worked with Peter Brook 's International Centre for Theatre Research, and
joined the group's tour in North Africa and the US which created The Conference of the Birds .
Returning to the RSC she played Lady Macbeth at Stratford in 1974 and at the Aldwych Theatre in
1975.

As reported by Sally Beaumann in her 1982 history of the RSC, Mirren while appearing in Nunn's
Macbeth and in a highly publicised letter to the Guardian newspaper, attacked both the
National Theatre and the RSC for their lavish production expenditure, declaring it
"unnecessary and destructive to the art of the Theatre"; adding, "The realms of truth,
emotion and imagination reached for in acting a great play have become more and more remote,
often totally unreachable across an abyss of costume and technicalities..." But Mirren was
only stating publicly what many RSC actors had been saying in private for some years.

She notably starred at the Royal Court in September 1975 as the chanteuse Maggie in Teeth 'n'
Smiles , a musical play by David Hare , revived at Wyndham's Theatre in May 1976 winning her the
Plays & Players Best Actress award, voted by the London critics.

From November 1975 Mirren played in West End repertory with the Lyric Theatre Company as Nina
in The Seagull and Ella in Ben Travers ' new farce The Bed Before Yesterday ('Mirren is
stirringly voluptuous as the Harlowesque good-time girl': Michael Billington , Guardian,
10 December 1975). At the RSC in Stratford in 1977, and at the Aldwych the following year, she
played a steely Queen Margaret in Terry Hands ' production of the three parts of Henry VI , while
1979 saw her 'bursting with grace' with an acclaimed performance as Isabella in Peter Gill 's
otherwise unexceptional production of Measure for Measure at Riverside Studios .

In 1981 she returned to the Royal Court for the London premiere of Brian Friel 's Faith Healer .
In the same year she also received acclaim for her performance in the title role of John Webster
's The Duchess of Malfi , a Royal Exchange Theatre production at the Round House in London.
Reviewing her portrayal for the Sunday Telegraph , Francis King wrote: "Miss Mirrren never
leaves it in doubt that even in her absences, this ardent, beautiful woman is the most
important character of the story."

Her performance as Moll Cutpurse in The Roaring Girl Royal Shakespeare Theatre in January
1983, and at the Barbican Theatre April 1983), "swaggered through the action with radiant
singularity of purpose, filling in areas of light and shade that even Thomas Middleton and
Thomas Dekker omitted." - Michael Coveney , Financial Times , April 1983.

After a relatively barren sojourn in the Hollywood Hills, she returned to England at the
beginning of 1989 to co-star with Bob Peck at the Young Vic in the London premiere of the Arthur
Miller double-bill, Two Way Mirror , performances which prompted Miller to remark: "What is
so good about English actors is that they are not afraid of the open expression of large
emotions" (interview by Sheridan Morley : The Times 11 January 1989). In Elegy for a Lady she
played the svelte proprietress of a classy boutique, while as the blonde hooker in Some Kind of
Love Story she was "clad in a Freudian slip and shifting easily from waif-like vulnerability
to sexual aggression, giving the role a breathy Monroesque quality" ( Michael Billington ,
The Guardian ).

A stage career breakthrough came in 1994, in an Yvonne Arnaud Theatre production bound for the
West End and later Broadway, when Bill Bryden cast her as Natalya Petrovna in Ivan Turgenev 's A
Month in the Country . Her co-stars were John Hurt as her aimless lover Rakitin and Ralph
Fiennes in only his second professional stage appearance as the cocksure young tutor
Belyaev. "Instead of a bored Natalya fretting the summmer away in dull frocks, Mirren,
dazzlingly gowned, is a woman almost wilfully allowing her heart's desire for her son's young
tutor to rule her head and wreak domestic havoc....Creamy shoulders bared, she feels free to
launch into a gloriously enchanted, dreamily comic self-confession of love." ( John Thaxter
, Richmond & Twickenham Times , 4 March 1994).

Mirren was twice nominated for Broadway's Tony Award as Best Actress (Play): in 1995 for A
Month in the Country , the performance she had given the year before in the West End, and again in
2002 for August Strindberg 's Dance of Death .

She had an unhappy experience at the National Theatre in 1998 when she played Cleopatra to Alan
Rickman 's Antony. But in 2000 Nicholas Hytner , who had worked with Mirren on the film version
of The Madness of King George , cast her as Lady Torrance in his revival of Tennessee Williams '
Orpheus Descending at the Donmar Warehouse in London. Michael Billington , reviewing for The
Guardian , described her performance as "an exemplary study of an immigrant woman who has
acquired a patina of resilient toughness but who slowly acknowledges her sensuality."

At the National Theatre in November 2003 she again won praise playing Christine ("defiantly
cool, camp and skittish", Evening Standard ; "glows with mature sexual allure", Daily
Telegraph ) in a revival of Eugene O'Neill 's Mourning Becomes Electra directed by Howard
Davies .

[ edit ] Television awards

for her role in Losing Chase . She received two nominations in the Actress in a Mini-series or TV
Movie category for Elizabeth I , and Prime Suspect: Final Act , where she only won the Golden

[ edit ] Critics' Circle Award for Distinguished Service to the Arts



Each year since 1988 The Critics' Circle has presented an award for Distinguished Service to
the Arts, voted for by all members of the Circle, embracing Dance, Drama, Film, Music, Visual
Arts and Architecture.

At a celebratory luncheon on 10th April 2007 in the National Theatre's Terrace Restaurant,
the award for 2006 was presented to Dame Helen Mirren. [9]

As David Gritten , chairman of the Film section made clear, the decision to make the award was
voted on in November 2006, well in advance of the awards hubbub that surrounded her
performance in The Queen .

Accepting the award, an engraved crystal rose bowl, Mirren described it as the most useful she
has ever received, while reflecting poignantly that this now "might be the last award I will
win in my life. It has been a most incredible year. You do the work and then....."

Previous recipients include Sir Peter Hall (1988), Dame Judi Dench (1997) and Ian McKellen
(2003).

for everyone

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/KitKat.jpg/180px-KitKat.jpg
A Kit Kat bar or KitKat bar [1] is a confection which was first created by Rowntree Limited of
York , England , and now produced worldwide by NestlÃ© , which acquired Rowntree in 1988 , [2]
except in the USA where it is made under license by Hershey's . It consists of thick bars
composed of three layers of creme-filled wafer , covered in an outer layer of chocolate . Each
finger can be snapped from the bar one at a time.

History

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/KitKat_opened.jpg/180px-KitKat_opened.jpg

    The traditional four finger version of this chocolate bar was developed after a worker at
    the Rowntrees factory in York put a suggestion in the suggestion box for a snack that a 'man
    could have in his lunch box for work'. It was launched in September 1935 in the UK as
    Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (price: 2d). The two finger version was launched on May 15,
    1936. Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937 , and
    subsequently just Kit Kat after World War II . The name is believed to have come from the
    Kit-Cat Club , an 18th Century Whig literary club founded in the reign of James II and
    located at Christopher Catling ("Kit Cat")'s pie-house in Shire Lane, by Temple Bar . A
    meeting place of the Kit-Cat Club had such low ceilings that paintings hung inside needed
    to be especially short. Such paintings were later named after the club as ' Kit Kats ', as
    was a type of mutton pie . The Oxford English Dictionary (1989) writes:

        Kit-cat / kit-kat. {f. Kit (= Christopher) Cat or Catling, the keeper of the
        pie-house in Shire Lane, by Temple Bar, where the club originally met.}

    



The traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately 1cm by 12 cm. Kit Kat
Chunky has one large finger approximately 2.5 cm wide and was introduced in 1999 . Kit Kat bars
contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging from the half-finger
sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan to the three-fingered variants in Arabia to the twelve-finger Kit
Kat family-size bars in Australia and France. Kit Kat bars are sold either individually or in
bags, boxes or multi-packs. In the UK and Canada, NestlÃ© also produces a Kit Kat ice cream ;
and in Malaysia, Kit Kat Drumsticks .



[ edit ] Global confection



The Kit Kat has been manufactured in a number of localized versions for overseas markets such
as Canada , Germany , Japan , and Australia . Kit Kat bars available in the United States are
manufactured under license by The Hershey Company, a NestlÃ© competitor, due to a prior
licensing agreement with Rowntree.

The Kit Kat is the world's #2 chocolate bar [ citation needed ] after Snickers . In the UK, Kit Kat
is the number one brand both as a confectionery item and as a biscuit . In both the US and Canada,
the Kit Kat is also extremely popular and is one of the top ten candy bar brands. In recent years,
Kit Kats have also become very popular in Japan , a phenomenon attributed to the coincidental
similarity between the bar's name and the Japanese phrase kitto katsu , which roughly
translates to "You will surely win!" This has reportedly led to parents and children buying
them for school examination days as a sort of good luck charm. [1] However, transliteration is
not always in NestlÃ©'s favour - "kitto katto" (where 'katto' is taken to be a katakana
transliteration of the English verb 'cut') is understood to bestow Kit Kat with the less
positive significance of "you will most likely miss the cut". As such, gifts of a single
kit-kat are a running joke for senior high school students taking the University Entrance
Examinations in some areas. Further building on the teen market, NestlÃ© created a music
label in 2005 and bundled Kit Kats with CDs which has propelled the Kit Kat to become the #1
selling chocolate bar in Japan as well. [2]

The year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in
general. The popularity of low carb diets and the push to healthier eating stifled sales
growth in many parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from Cadbury's newly
formed Dairy Milk superbrand also contributed to sales of the Kit Kat decreasing
considerably in its home market of the UK and threatened to depose it from its #1 position. [3]
[4] The solution adopted by NestlÃ© and others was to dramatically increase the number of
new and unique variations of their confections and market them as limited or special editions
whereby they would usually only be available for a few months at a time so as not to impact the
sales of their permanent edition counterparts. [5] The strategy initially reversed the
decline of the Kit Kat [6] and has been adopted worldwide by NestlÃ©, Hershey, Mars and
others with similar success. [7] [8] This has resulted in many new flavors and varieties of the
Kit Kat and other confections appearing globally since then. While some flavors have been
hits, many have flopped, alienating some consumers in the process, causing NestlÃ© to
scale back on new releases.

In late 2005 Chris White, the managing director of NestlÃ© Rowntree abruptly left his job
amid controversy that his marketing strategies may in fact have had a negative impact on Kit
Kat and confection sales in the long term. [9] Also, in September 2006 NestlÃ© announced
they were eliminating 25% of their workforce in York and moving production of Smarties to
Germany. One of the reasons given for the cuts and moves was so that the York factory could be
modernized for Kit Kat production to continue. [10]

As dark chocolate has seen increased demand and favor worldwide because of its purported
health benefits, September 2006 saw the launch of the four finger Kit Kat Fine Dark in the UK as a
permanent edition as well as new packaging for the entire brand. [ citation needed ] Hershey,
which had previously sold the four finger Kit Kat Dark in the US several years ago as a limited
edition, is also expected to re-introduce the bar as a permanent edition in the near future.

[ edit ] The Big Brother UK Series 7 golden ticket draw



During the first three weeks of Big Brother Series 7 , Channel 4 conducted a promotion in
conjunction with Nestle to distribute 100 golden tickets randomly throughout Kit Kat
chocolate bars , in a style reminiscent of the story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory .
Members of the public finding these tickets were permitted to use them to give themselves a
chance to become a Big Brother house-mate and bypass the standard auditions process.

Golden ticket holders were invited to a television show where one of them, Susie Verrico , was
chosen to enter the House by Aisleyne , picking a ball out of a machine at random.

This contest has caused some controversy, with the Advertising Standards Authority UK
saying that the terms and conditions of the draw should have been made clearer in related
advertisements, and that an independent adjudicator should have been present before and
during the draw. [3] .

    Trivia

    - Kit Kat bars are manufactured in 13 countries: UK , USA , Canada , Australia , South Africa
    , Germany , Japan , China , Malaysia , India , Turkey , Venezuela and Bulgaria .

    

    

    - After launching in the 1930s, Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised as
    "the biggest little meal" and "the best companion to a cup of tea". During the Second World
    War, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff, with the slogan "what active
    people need". 'Kitty the Kat' arrived in the late 1940s to emphasize the "rich full cream
    milk" qualities of the bar and, thanks to contemporary improvements in production
    methods, also highlighted the new and improved 'snap' by responding to a biscuit being
    broken off screen. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the first color TV advert
    appeared in 1969.

    

    

    - Since 1957, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been "Have a break...
    have a Kit Kat". However, in 1995, NestlÃ© sought to trademark the "Have a break"
    portion. After a ten year legal battle which was contested by rival Mars, the European
    Court of Justice ruled on July 7, 2005 to send the case back to the British Courts. [11] In
    the meantime, NestlÃ© UK changed the slogan in 2004 to "Make the most of your break".
    [12] The new slogan was not embraced outside of the UK and recently NestlÃ© Rowntree has
    returned to using the original slogan.

    

    

    - The traditional red wrapper of the original bar briefly became blue between 1945 - 1947.
    As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II, the milk chocolate coating was
    suspended and a dark chocolate used instead during that period.

    

    

    - In the UK, NestlÃ© has confirmed that the correct spelling of the brand name is KitKat
    (one word) although this is not consistent on their website nor on other Kit Kat websites
    around the world.

    

    

    - The Hershey Company's license to produce Kit Kat bars in the United States dates to 1969 ,
    when Hershey executed a licensing agreement for both the Kit Kat and the Rolo with
    Rowntree. NestlÃ©, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honor the
    licensing agreement which allows Hershey to retain the Kit Kat / Rolo license so long as
    Hershey is not sold. This was a factor in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious
    buyer in 2002 . [13] [14]

    

    

    - Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and advertising in the USA has differed from the branding
    used in every other country where the candy is sold although in 2002 Hershey Kit Kats
    finally started to adopt the slanted ellipse logo used worldwide by NestlÃ©.

    

    

    - One version of the advertising jingle 'Gimme a break' created for Kit Kat "Factory"
    commercial in the USA was an original recording by Andrew W. K. However, the "classic"
    version (in use since 1986) was written by Ken Shuldman (lyrics) and Michael A. Levine
    (music). Versions have been recorded by Carrie Underwood, Shawn Colvin, and an army of
    studio singers.

    

    

    - The jingle was cited in a study by Univ. of Cincinnati researcher James A. Kellaris as one
    of the top ten " earworms " - bits of melody that become stuck in your head. Earworms are
    considered a pathological condition.

    

    

    - Specialist vehicles with snow chains and diesel heaters are used to ship Kit Kats from
    the Scunthorpe depot to Russia and the other cold regions during the winter.

    

    

    - UK Kit Kat stocks are stored in two large warehouses in York, which have a total
    floorspace of 186,500 square ft and a combined capacity of 37,500 pallets.

    

    

    - The Kit Kat Orange was the first flavour variant. It was introduced in the UK in 1996,
    followed in 1997 by the Kit Kat Dark and Kit Kat Mint. Today all three are available as
    permanent editions in the UK in two finger multipacks, along with the Kit Kat Original and
    Kit Kat White.

    

    

    - A three finger Kit Kat is produced for the Middle East, simply to match a denomination of
    the local currency and make the product a convenient, one-coin purchase.

    

    

    - A wide variety of promotional items exist, ranging from the obvious (such as mugs, pens,
    oven gloves and tea-towels) to the somewhat less obvious (such as Kit Kat coats for small
    dogs). Recently in Japan, Kit Kats have come packaged with CD singles and a special
    limited edition double pack of Kit Kat Crispy Monogatari came bundled with a mini book
    featuring six short stories, one of which is written by Koji Suzuki , author of the Ring
    cycle series of books.

    

    

    - KitKash is one of the most recent Kit Kat promotions by NestlÃ©. Premiering in
    Australia and New Zealand in 2004, each Kit Kat wrapper contained a unique code inside. A
    winning code was potentially worth $20, $50, $100 or even $10,000. In 2005 the UK's
    KitKash involved registering an account on the KitKash website and accumulating the
    codes which each had a point value in order to buy, bid or win products on the site. In 2006
    KitKash has been expanded in the UK to include KitKash points in many of NestlÃ©'s other
    confections as well as spread to Germany (ChocoCash) and France (Kit Kat Kode). USA Kit
    Kats are also part of the action thanks to Hershey (WrapperCash).

    

    

    - In late 2004 , NestlÃ© Rowntree started to sponsor York City F.C. at least until the end
    of 2006. In return the club's home playing ground Bootham Crescent has been renamed
    KitKat Crescent . [15]

    

    

    - A 1989 advertisement for KitKat, in which a giant panda in a zoo "takes a break" came 30th
    in Channel 4 's "100 Greatest Adverts" poll in 2000. Another memorable 1980s UK TV advert
    for KitKat featured a music mogul auditioning a new band, ending with the line "You can't
    sing, you can't play, you look awful" (Pause) "You'll go a long way."

Jul 26, '07 1:41 AM

for everyone Pernahkah korang beli Pringles? Pernah beli Tak pernah beli    

Pringles are a brand of potato snacks produced by Procter & Gamble . Pringles were first sold in
October of 1968 ; they were not rolled out nationally until the mid-1970s [1] . They were
originally known as "Pringle's Newfangled Potato Chips", but the name was changed for
introduction to the national market. Procter & Gamble chose the Pringles name from a
Cincinnati telephone book, selecting Pringle Avenue in Finneytown, Ohio for its pleasing
sound. [2] Pringles are advertised in the United States with the slogan "Once you pop, the fun
don't stop", and in the UK with "Once you pop, you just can't stop". In North America, Pringles
are not marketed as potato chips, but rather "potato crisps". This is a food labeling
requirement, since Pringles are made from a dough rather than from sliced fresh potatoes.

According to the patent , Pringles were invented by Alexander Liepa of Montgomery, Ohio . Gene
Wolfe developed the machine that cooks them; the dough making and rolling portion was
designed by Len Hooper. [3] Pringles are especially known for their packaging (invented by
Fred Baur ), which consists of an upright tubular can with a foil-coated interior, and a
resealable plastic lid; it also has a famous logo , a stylized representation of a man with a
large moustache and parted bangs (until 2001, the man, commonly known as "Julius Pringles",
had eyebrows and his bowtie housed the product name.) The crisps are made to a uniform size and
saddle shape, so that they stack very efficiently within the container, rather than being
packaged loosely in a bag. The cans come in 170g, 163g, 50g, and 23g sizes. In early 2007 , the
company introduced an 80g size. [4]

Pringles come in several flavors, and occasionally Procter & Gamble produces limited
edition runs. Some flavors may be distributed only to limited market areas. Seasonal
flavors, past and present, include ketchup , chili cheese dog , and Cajun.

    Newer products

    - In 2004 , Pringles released a Pringles Prints. Pringles Prints are no different than
    regular Pringles, except that these have trivia questions or jokes printed on them,
    using red or blue food coloring .

    

    

    - In late 2006, Pringles rolled out a fat-free variety of their product. Originally
    titled "Fat Free Pringles", it was quickly reissued with a new look and the name "Pringles
    Lights". This version contains the fat substitute Olestra , which at one time was
    purported to have caused such side effects (such as diarrhea ) in some individuals, but
    has been cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration .

    

    

    - In early 2007, Pringles introduced the most significant new product since the original
    canistered Pringles. Pringles Select Gourmet Chips differed from Pringles in almost
    every way imaginable. The most obvious initial difference is the packaging; Pringles
    Select are not packaged in the familiar canister (apart from the UK); they come in a small
    bag. However, unlike other chips, the bag has a flat bottom, allowing it to stand, and it is
    designed to be opened at the top and sealed shut when it is not in use. Another difference is
    that the chips are not saddle-shaped, and do not neatly stack on one another. Yet the
    biggest difference in with Pringles Select Gourmet Chips is not the packaging or shape of
    the chips, but rather, that most of the varieties are not made of potatoes at all. They are
    made from a variety of bases, including rice , sweet potato , and corn . For example, the
    Szechuan Barbecue flavor comes in a rice chip.

Alternative uses



 







Because of the metallic interior and long, tubular shape, the cans have been used to make Wi-Fi
network antennas, known as cantennas . Some fans of the chip brand collect the empty holders,
which are colorful, uniform, and useful for storing small items such as paintbrushes.
Germany's Ronnie has a collection of over 600 different cans from around the world, Canada's
Terence Fink has a collection featuring 117 unique cans in 12 different languages.

It is possible to throw the plastic lid on a Pringles can in a similar fashion to a frisbee . When
released with the correct technique, they are surprisingly stable in flight, and can travel
upwards of 50 feet. The established throwing technique is to hold the lid between the thumb and
middle finger, starting with your arm in a backhand throwing position, held at just above
waist height. A flick is critical when releasing the lid, to achieve sufficient spin. As
Pringles lids require much more spin than Frisbees to maintain stability, successful
forehand throws are extremely difficult to achieve. At sufficiently small angles of
incidence Pringles lids will rebound from walls, and due to their lighter construction and
shorter range, they are a safer alternative to throwing a disc around indoors.

There is an alternate method of flicking a Pringles lid that involves only the fingers, with no
wrist or hand movement required. The hand holding the lid is orientated with the palm facing
away from the body, with the finger horizontal to the floor. The lid is held with the lip on the
underside (as it would sit on top of a can of Pringles), the thumb is placed on the underside of
the lid, against the lip. The lid is held using only the thumb, and either the index or the middle
finger. The finger (not the thumb) is responsible for pushing and spinning the lid in the
required direction, while the thumb is used to accelerate the finger (which in turn
accelerates the lid). The acceleration is achieved by performing a 'click' with the finger
and thumb, while the lid is placed between the thumb and the finger and while the lid is facing
the direction the lid should travel. This method can be used to achieve a startling degree of
accuracy.

The container can be used to make what is known as a "pringle cannon" by using a pencil to poke a
hole in the side of an empty can, putting the lid back on, and forcefully exhaling into the hole
previously made. If done correctly, a very loud pop will be heard as the lid is sent flying.
Different flight paths and distances can be achieved by putting the hole in different places
on the can's side. The tube may also be filled with confetti , causing the confetti to shoot out
quickly and stream slowly to the ground.

In digital photography , the translucent Pringles can lid can be used to " white balance "
digital cameras. The lid is held over the lens and a photo is taken.The result is a whitish blur
that is a diffuse image of the ambient light and its color temperature. The Pringles lid photo
is then used to set the camera's manual white balance temperature, so that subsequent photos
taken in the same light will have more accurate color reproduction.

The long tubular Pringles can has also been used as the housing of macro lenses.

for everyone



Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/TideLogo.gif Tide is the name of
a popular laundry detergent on the market in the United States , Canada and other countries. It
is manufactured by Procter & Gamble .

First introduced in test markets in 1946 with national distribution reached in 1949 , Tide was
touted as " America's Washday Favorite ." It quickly gained dominance in the detergent
market, dwarfing the sales of other P&G products, such as Ivory Snow , as well as the
competition from Rinso . The latter two were soap products. Originally, Tide was a white
powdered solid , but the brand line was later expanded to include a liquid form, an
orange-tinted clear fluid; today, liquid Tide is generally a darkish blue color.

Tide is recognized for its distinctive orange-and-yellow bullseye logo. The original logo
was designed by Donald Deskey , a famous industrial and identity designer. Tide was the first
product to be nationally packaged using Day-Glo colors, strikingly eye catching when first
introduced. The logo people see today is a product of a slight modification for the product's
fiftieth anniversary in 1996 . Currently, the Tide brand is given to over half a dozen powders
and liquid detergents in the United States alone.

The potential of dodecyl benzene , the basis for Tide, was confirmed by SRI in 1948 through
strategic scientific and business consulting activities for the petroleum company Chevron
.

Tide sponsored various NASCAR Winston Cup teams from 1987 until 2006. They sponsored drivers
Darrell Waltrip , Ricky Rudd , and Ricky Craven , among others.

he hears a spooky noise. Tags: p&g , detergent , blog , artikel , article , dinkacak , tide

Coca-Cola Zero or Coke Zero is a product of the Coca-Cola Company . It is a sugar-free variation
of Coca-Cola . In the United States, where the drink was first introduced, Coke Zero is
marketed as having zero calories [1] (hence the Zero in the product's name), but in other
countries it is marketed as having zero sugar . [2] Coca-Cola Zero in fact has a small caloric
value. Depending on the country in which it is made, it has about 0.2 to 0.5 calories per 100 mL
(3.4 US fl. oz. ). [3]

Marketing

Coke Zero is Coca-Cola's biggest product launch in 22 years, and primarily targets young
adult males. In the U.S., advertising has reflected that by describing the drink as
"calorie-free" rather than "diet", since that demographic associates diet drinks with
women. [12]

It also makes the marketing claim that the taste is almost indistinguishable from Coca-Cola
since, unlike Diet Coke , Coke Zero is based on the formulation of Coca-Cola. A 2007 U.S. viral
marketing campaign for Coke Zero played to that theme by suggesting that the company's
executives were so angry over the drinks' similarities they were considering suing their
coworkers for "taste infringement". It featured company executives talking to actual
lawyers who were not let in on the deceit, and solicited customers as possible plaintiffs .
[12]

In Australia, the company created a controversial fake front group to promote the product,
[13] a campaign of outdoor graffiti and online spamming (which promoted a fake blog ), was
created by Coca-Cola and designed to appeal to its target audience. Once exposed, consumer
advocates assailed the campaign as misleading and established the Zero Coke Movement to
comment on the ethics of Coke's activities. [14]

In the UK, Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Cole was signed up to launch the product in a campaign aimed
at young men. [15] A television advert was broadcast, featuring a group of men marching
through a city saying "Why can't all the good things in life come without downsides?", ending
with a huge banner being rolled down a building, reminiscent of a scene from the German film
Good Bye Lenin! . (The same TV ad has been used in some other markets, like Croatia.) Recently,
Manchester United and England football player Wayne Rooney and his girlfriend Coleen
McLoughlin have been advertising Coke Zero in a print campaign.

In Austria, the launch of Coke Zero is currently underway. Massive viral marketing is taking
place, corporate representatives are spamming online forums, e.g. of major newspapers's
websites, with links to the fake-blog Zeronistas.at. On this blog, the "Zeronistas" are
portrayed as a group of 4â€“5 male persons who are "striving to continuously improve the
life of young men". The website/blog is also being advertised via outdoor posters similar to
concert announcement posters. [ citation needed ]

In Norway, the launch started on Monday October 2 , 2006 [16] and like in Australia the online
forums are being spammed by the companies representatives. [17] The launch is the largest and
most expensive launch of any food product ever seen in Norway. [ citation needed ]

In Finland, Coca-Cola called off the Zero marketing campaign on Internet due to its sexist
implications. The campaign was deemed to objectify women as sex objects and hence endorse
discriminating attitudes to women. [18]

In January 2007, the campaign started in Argentina , with the taglines "Coca-Cola Zero, el
sabor que nadie esperaba" (Coca-Cola Zero, the flavor nobody expected) and "El mismo sabor de
siempre, zero azÃºcar" (The same taste as always, zero sugar).

On January 15, 2007, television commercials for Zero appeared in Denmark and the product can
be found in local stores. Coke Zero launched in Ireland on February 8 , 2007 , with Girls Aloud
singer Sarah Harding as the face of the brand, much like her bandmate Cheryl Cole was in the UK.

With its current targeting of young males Coke Zero seems destined to compete head on with
Pepsi Max . In the UK some Coke Zero advertising alluded to Pepsi Max, leading to a robust
counter-campaign by Pepsi directly extolling the virtues of the concept of "maximum" over
that of "zero."

Coke Zero's US ads make use of a superimposed computer image on the Coke Zero can. In earlier
versions of these commercials, the can's design was different and its colors were inverted.

[ edit ] Product logo



 







The Coca-Cola Zero logo has generally featured the script Coca-Cola logo in red with white
trim on a black background, with the word "zero" underneath in a lower case geometric typeface
looking a lot like Twentieth Century . Some details have varied from country to country. The
British logo, for example, has the "o" taking a spiral form. In the U.S., the letters decline in
weight over the course of the word.

The U.S. and Canada also appear to be the only countries in which the logo originally had a white
background, with a black "zero". This was the face of the drink from its inception until late
2006, when a holiday theme triggered the switch. The black color was kept on 2-liter bottles
into 2007, and was introduced on cans as the new year began. This further diminished the
confusion there was between Diet Coke and Coke Zero having a similar white logo with black
letters. Twenty-ounce (591 ml) bottles remained white for some time afterwards, but black
labels began to be phased in in late February shortly after the launch of Cherry Coke Zero.

The advertising agency VCCP handle the Coca-cola account and all its ATL activity within the
UK.



[ edit ] Dispute over the Zero name



In Norway the Brewery Ringnes claims that Bryggeriforeningen owns the right to Zero name. The
Zero name was used on a non alcoholic beverage from 1972 to 1996. [19]



[ edit ] Criticism

    

    - Several customers in Norway have complained that Coca Cola Zero in 1.5 litre bottles
    contains particles. [ specify ] A representative of the Norwegian division of Coca Cola
    Company says that one of the ingredients did not mix well enough. [20]

    

    - There are also concerns about health effects of aspartame .

    





[ edit ] Flavored variants



Coca-Cola Cherry Zero is a cherry -flavored variation of Coca-Cola Zero. In late January of
2007, it was introduced to store shelves and was widely available throughout the United
States even before its official dÃ©but. The official dÃ©but of Coca-Cola Cherry Zero
occurred on February 7, 2007, at New York City 's Fashion Week . [21]

Coca-Cola introduced a vanilla -flavored version, Coca-Cola Vanilla Zero, concurrently
with the relaunch of the original Coca-Cola Vanilla in May 2007. [22] Tags: coca-cola , coca ,

Diet Coke (sometimes known as Diet Coca-Cola ) or Coca-Cola Light (sometimes known as Coke
Light ) is a sugar -free soft drink produced and distributed by The Coca-Cola Company . It was
introduced in the United States on July 9, 1982 as Diet Coca-Cola , and was the first new brand
since 1886 to use the Coca-Cola trademark. The product quickly overtook Tab in sales.

Diet Coke was sweetened with aspartame as soon as the sweetener became available in the U.S. ,
1983 ; however, to save money, this was originally in a blend with saccharin . After Diet Rite
cola advertised its 100 percent use of aspartame, and the manufacturer of NutraSweet (then,
G.D. Searle & Company ) warned that the NutraSweet trademark would not be made available to a
blend of sweeteners, Coca-Cola switched the formula to 100 percent NutraSweet, later
switching back and doing without the NutraSweet trademark. Diet Coke from fountain d

ispensers still contains some saccharin (to extend shelf life). [1]

In other countries, where cyclamates were not banned, as they were in the U.S. and the United
Kingdom in 1970 , Diet Coke or Coca-Cola Light may be sweetened with a blend containing
cyclamates , aspartame , and acesulfame potassium .

In 2005 , under pressure from retailer Wal-Mart (which was impressed with the popularity of
Splenda sweetener), the company released a new formulation called "Diet Coke sweetened with
Splenda." Sucralose and acesulfame potassium replace aspartame in this version. Early
sales reports for this version were not quite as strong as anticipated; however, Coca-Cola
did little advertising for the brand, investing money and advertising in Coca-Cola Zero
instead. The introduction of the Splenda sweetened version of Diet Coke saw complaints to
bottlers, as store shelves would often go with very little of the normal version of Diet Coke.

Diet Coke does not utilize a modified form of the Coca-Cola recipe but is instead an entirely
different formula. The controversial New Coke , introduced in 1985 , used a version of the Diet
Coke recipe that contained high fructose corn syrup and had a slightly different balance of
ingredients. In 2004 Coca-Cola introduced Coca-Cola C2 , which it claims tastes much closer
to Coca-Cola but contains half the carbohydrates . In 2006, The Coca-Cola Co. introduced
Coca-Cola Zero , a sugar-free variation of regular Coca-Cola .

Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/da/Nccc.jpg

When Tab was released in 1963 , the Coca-Cola Company refused to use the Coca-Cola brandname,
fearing that its flagship brand might suffer by being used on another product, the long-term
viability of which was uncertain. (Ironically, Tab is still available today, even though
vastly outsold by Diet Coke.) Its rival Pepsi had no such qualms, and after the long-term
success of its sugar-free brand Diet Pepsi , launched in 1964 , became clear, Coca-Cola
decided to launch a new sugar-free brand under the Coca-Cola name to compete with Diet Pepsi.
With the well-known name, it could be marketed more extensively than the more anonymously
dubbed Tab.

Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi have capitalized on the markets of people who require low sugar
regimens, such as diabetics and people with other health conditions, athletes, and people
who want to lose weight. In the UK, a 330 ml can of Diet Coke contains around 1.3 Calories (5
kilojoules) compared to 142 Calories (595 kJ) for a regular can of Coca-Cola.

Diet Coke is currently celebrating its 25th Anniversary.

Wikinews has related news: Fizzy drinks out of New Zealand schools from 2009

The most commonly distributed version of Diet Coke (and majority of beverages using
artificial sweeteners) relies on Aspartame , which has been blamed by some scientists and
medical professionals for possibly causing serious illnesses (such as cancer, brain
tumors, brain lesions, and lymphoma) when consumed in large quantities [2] [3] . One of the
chemicals produced by aspartame after ingestion is methanol , which is also used in
antifreeze . [4] [5] It should be noted that Coca-Cola has now released Diet Coke sweetened
with sucralose (also known as Splenda), although it is not as common. See also soft drink
controversy .

An article published in The Independent on May 27 , 2007 highlights the dangers of sodium
benzoate in soft drinks. According to the article, the sodium benzoate combines with the
citric acid in the drink to form benzene , a known carcinogen. Also, the sodium benzoate was
found to break down mitochondrial DNA in living yeast cells. [6]

    - It is possible to cause a sudden high-pressure release of carbon dioxide known as a
    Mentos eruption by inserting multiple Mentos into a container of Diet Coke. Mythbusters
    found this is caused because of nucleation as well as certain catalysts in the Diet Coke
    and Mentos themselves. The phenomenon is described in some detail by the General
    Chemistry Online! FAQ, which also attributes it to nucleation. [7]

    - Diet Coke is featured in the film Zoolander as an advertisement done by Derek Zoolander.

    

    - Name of song in a recent Diet Coke commercial (dancing in red socks to look like a diet coke
    can) is "I Like The Way You Move" by The Bodyrockers.

    

    - Often referred to as a "DC Special" when ordering in Delaware taverns. Recent usage of

Coca-Cola Cherry is produced and distributed by The Coca-Cola Company's bottlers . It was
introduced in 1985 as Cherry Coke . It is the third variation of Coca-Cola at that time (the
others being classic Coke and Diet Coke ) and the first flavored Coke. Diet Cherry Coke was
introduced in 1986 , and renamed "Diet Coke Cherry" in 2005 . Cherry Coke was long available in
diners and at drugstore counters, when cherry-flavored syrup was added to the Coca-Cola mix.
(See also: Roy Rogers cocktail .)

In late 2005 , The Coca-Cola Company started to streamline the look of all of their products to
carry the same naming scheme, design and style, similar to the newer, but simpler Coca-Cola
Black Cherry Vanilla design: The Coca-Cola logo and ribbon in the center with the flavor
showing to the bottom right of the logo, the background carrying a 'tint' of the flavor (Lime is
green, etc).If Diet, the "diet" marker is added to the left and above the Coca-Cola logo, and
the background of the label carrying more of a 'silver' color indicating Diet , showing the
similarity to the original Diet Coca-Cola . Due to this new design, the product name was
changed from "Cherry Coke" to Coca-Cola Cherry . But while the design for Coca-Cola Cherry was
quickly changed, its "Sister" version Diet Cherry Coke has had limited availability since
the product changes, its new name being Diet Coke Cherry . As of June 2006, the diet product has
started to re-appear with the new design.

It is available in many other regions, including the United Kingdom , where it is popular
amongst teenagers.[ Citation needed ] The drink became available to Australia and Israel in
2003 but was soon discontinued. The Australian Coke Company, Coca Cola Amatil explained that
the drink had failed to gain acceptance by Australians who have "more conservative palates"

It is also now available in Japan since November 2006 and is known as Cherry Coke. It comes in
silver bottle shaped can with retro 80's style coke label.

The Coca-Cola Company later introduced other flavored Coke variants including Vanilla Coke
in May 2002 , Coca-Cola with Lime in 2005, and Coca-Cola Black Cherry Vanilla in 2006.

On February 7th, 2007, Coca-Cola officially launched its new campaign for the Cherry Coke
Brand. Jay-Z was chosen to be the spokesmen, and played a part in designing the new can
graphics. A new diet version, Coca-Cola Cherry Zero, was also introduced, although the
original Diet Coke Cherry will remain available in 12-packs. Tags: coca-cola , cherry , coke ,

for everyone



Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/OldSpice_logo.gif Old Spice is
an American brand of male grooming products. It is manufactured by Procter & Gamble , which
acquired the brand in 1990 from the Shulton Company .

History

The first Old Spice product, a fragrance called Early American Old Spice for women, was
introduced in 1937, closely followed by Old Spice for men in 1938. The Old Spice products were
manufactured by the Shulton Company that was founded in 1934 by William Lightfoot Schultz.
The earliest of the men's products were dominated by shaving soap and aftershave lotion.

Early American Old Spice was developed around a colonial theme. When Old Spice was
introduced, William Lightfoot Schultz was interested in maintaining a colonial framework
for those products and chose a nautical theme for Old Spice. Thus, sailing ships, in
particular colonial sailing ships, were used as a trademark . Through continuous use and
advertising, the various ships have become a valuable trademark identifying the Old Spice
product for men.

The original ships used on the packaging were the Grand Turk and the Friendship . Other ships
used on Old Spice packaging include the Wesley, Salem, Birmingham and Hamilton .

Procter & Gamble purchased Old Spice from the Shulton Company in June 1990. The clipper ship
was replaced by the Sailboat/Yacht logo in the fragrance bottles in February 1992. More
recently, P&G has introduced many forms of deodorant sticks, body washes, and body sprays in
several scents under the Old Spice brand. Old Spice is now the No. 1 antiperspirant/deodorant
stick and body wash brand in the United States.



[ edit ] Products



Old Spiceâ€™s buoy -shaped bottle cologne has been its staple product, available in its
original scent as well as newer Pure Sport. In 2006, Old Spice introduced an all-new
fragrance, OS Signature, which won FHM â€™s 2006 Grooming Award for Best Sporty
Fragrance. Current Old Spice Red Zone products include a "Scratch-and-sniff" version of the
OS Fragrance as a method of promoting the new scent.

Old Spice currently has two lines of grooming products and each line features a variety of
products and scents. "High Endurance" is promoted as a basic grooming line, and includes
antiperspirant, deodorant, body wash, hair & body wash, and shaving products. "Red Zone" is
aimed as a higher-end line, including an antiperspirant, deodorant, body wash, and body
spray . The High Endurance line has a line tied into Old Spice-sponsored NASCAR driver Tony
Stewart that was launched in 2006.

They also come in various fragrances.

High Endurance: Pure Sport, Fresh, Arctic Force, Pacific Surge, Original, Mountain Rush,
and Smooth Blast.

Red Zone: Pure Sport, After Hours, Showtime, Glacial Falls, Aqua Reef, Deep Cleansing,
Hydrowash and Vitality.



[ edit ] Popular Culture

  In the 1982 film E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial , while searching through their garage for
spare parts, Elliot and Michael find their dad's old shirt. Michael incorrectly guesses the
smell to be Old Spice when Elliot correctly responds Sea Breeze .

In 2006, Old Spice was chosen to be the sponsor of Ricky Bobby's teammate, Cal Naughton, Jr. in
the film Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby .

In the movie Deep Throat , Linda Lovelace is shown shaving her pubic hair with an Old Spice
shaving kit while the soundtrack plays a sea shanty .

In 2007, legendary b-movie actor Bruce Campbell did a very well-received commercial for Old
Spice in which he talked about experience, dressed in a robe and pacing around in a fancy den. On
the table next to the armchair is the Necronomicon , and next to the fireplace is a chainsaw,
both references to Campbell's most famous role as Ash Williams , the protagonist of the Evil
Dead series . He recently performed in another commercial for Old Spice, singing a lounge
version of Duran Duran 's Hungry Like the Wolf to five attractive women.

Old Spice is a sponsor of NASCAR driver Tony Stewart .

In the movie Red Dragon , Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter makes fun of Edward Norton 's
choice of aftershave suggesting that it is from "the bottle with a little ship on it," which is a
clear reference to the Old Spice signature schooners. He also makes a further joke about Old
Spice's aftershave when he says that "it is something a child would wear."

A condom is a device, usually made of latex , or more recently polyurethane , that is used during
sexual intercourse . It is put on a man's erect penis and physically blocks ejaculated semen
from entering the body of a sexual partner. Condoms are used to prevent pregnancy and
transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIsâ€”such as gonorrhea ,
syphilis , and HIV ).

Background B.C. type Barrier First use 1994 (polyurethane)

1912 (latex)

1855 (rubber)

Ancient (other materials) Pregnancy rates (first year, latex) Perfect use 2% Typical use
10â€“18% Usage User reminders Damaged by oil-based lubricants Advantages and
Disadvantages STD protection Yes Weight No effect Benefits No external drugs or clinic
visits required Overview

Male condoms are usually packaged inside a foil wrapper, in a rolled-up form, and are designed
to be applied to the tip of the penis and then rolled over the erect penis. They are most commonly
made from latex , but are also available in other materials. As a method of contraception ,
condoms have the advantage of being easy to use, inexpensive, having few side-effects, and of
offering protection against sexually transmitted diseases. With proper knowledge and
application techniqueâ€”and use at every act of intercourseâ€”condom users
experience a 2% per-year pregnancy rate. [1] Condoms may be combined with other forms of
contraception (such as spermicide ) for greater protection. [2]

Some couples find that putting on a male condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate
condom application as part of their foreplay. Some men and women find the physical barrier of a
condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and
delayed ejaculation. [3] ; disadvantages might include a loss of the erection, or a loss of the
pleasure of sexual actions.

Most condoms have a reservoir tip, making it easier to leave space for the man's ejaculate.
Condoms also come in different sizes, from magnum to snug. Mass produced condoms vary hardly
at all in width, but vary significantly in length. [ citation needed ]

[ edit ] Latex



 







Latex condoms are the most distributed type of condom in the world and there are thousands of
variants in regards to size, thickness, and texture. The most popular variants of the
standard condom are condoms with a ribbed or studded texture, those that come in different
colors or scents, and those marketed as larger sized condoms. [4] There are also condoms
available that are lubricated with a very small amount of Benzocaine (usually under 4%). The
use of Benzocaine with the lubrication on the inside of the condom produces a slight numbing
sensation for the man and is meant to help him prolong sexual activity before climax. [5]
Currently the thinnest latex condom stands at 0.03mm thick. [6]

An unrolled latex condom

Lubricants

Latex condoms used with oil-based lubricants (e.g. vaseline ) are likely to slip off due to
loss of elasticity caused by the oils. [7]

Some latex condoms are lubricated at the manufacturer with a small amount of a nonoxynol-9 , a
spermicidal chemical . According to Consumer Reports , spermicidally lubricated condoms
have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy, have a shorter shelf life, and may cause
urinary-tract infections in women. [8] In contrast, application of separately packaged
spermicide is believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms. [2]

Nonoxynol-9 was once believed to offer additional protection against STDs (including HIV)
but recent studies have shown that, with frequent use, nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of
HIV transmission. [9] The World Health Organization says that spermicidally lubricated
condoms should no longer be promoted. However, they recommend using a nonoxynol-9
lubricated condom over no condom at all. [10] As of 2005, nine condom manufacturers have
stopped manufacturing condoms with nonoxynol-9, Planned Parenthood has discontinued the
distribution of condoms so lubricated, [11] and the Food and Drug Administration has
proposed a warning regarding this issue. [12]



[ edit ] Testing



Latex has outstanding elastic properties. Tensile strength exceeds 30 MPa. Condoms may be
stretched in excess of 800% before breaking. [13]

In 1990 the ISO set standards for production (ISO 4074, Natural latex rubber condoms) and the
EU followed suit with its CEN standard (Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices).
Latex condoms are tested for holes with an electrical current. If the condom passes, it is
rolled and packaged. Batches of condoms are tested for breakage with air inflation tests.
[14]



[ edit ] Health issues



Dry dusting powders are applied to latex condoms before packaging to prevent the condom from
sticking to itself when rolled up. Previously, talc was used by most manufacturers, however
cornstarch is currently the most popular dusting powder. [15] Talc is known to be toxic if it
enters the abdominal cavity (i.e. via the vagina ). Cornstarch is generally believed to be
safe, however some researchers have raised concerns over its use. [15] [16]

Nitrosamines , which are potentially carcinogenic in humans, [17] are believed to be present
in a substance used to improve elasticity in latex condoms. [18] A 2001 review stated that
humans regularly receive 1,000 to 10,000 times greater nitrosamine exposure from food and
tobacco than from condom use and concluded that the risk of cancer from condom use is very low.
[19] However, a 2004 study in Germany detected nitrosamines in 29 out of 32 condom brands
tested, and concluded that exposure from condoms might exceed the exposure from food by 1.5-
to 3-fold. [18] [20]



[ edit ] Other materials





[ edit ] Polyurethane

    

        See also: AT-10 Resin

    



Polyurethane condoms can be thinner than latex condoms, with some polyurethane condoms only
0.02 mm thick. [21] Polyurethane is also the material of many female condoms .

Polyurethane can be considered better than latex in several ways: it conducts heat better
than latex, is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light (and so has less rigid
storage requirements and a longer shelf life), can be used with oil-based lubricants, is less
allergenic than latex, and does not have an odor. [22] Polyurethane condoms have gained FDA
approval for sale in the United States as an effective method of contraception and HIV
prevention, and under laboratory conditions have been shown to be just as effective as latex
for these purposes. [23]

However, polyurethane condoms may be more likely to slip or break than latex, [22] [24] and are
more expensive.



[ edit ] Lambskin



Condoms made from one of the oldest condom materials, labeled "lambskin" (made from lamb
intestines ) are still available. They have a greater ability to transmit body warmth and
tactile sensation, when compared to synthetic condoms, and are less allergenic than latex.
However, conventional wisdom holds that there is an increased risk of transmitting STDs
compared to latex because of pores in the material, which are thought to be large enough to
allow infectious agents to pass through, albeit blocking the passage of sperm. Lambskin
condoms are frequently called ineffective with regards to preventing sexually transmitted
diseases. [25] Nonetheless, hard data regarding the alleged lack of efficacy are lacking.
Although a search of the PubMed database of medical literature does not demonstrate any
clinical trials demonstrating that lambskin condoms have decreased efficacy, at least one
study does suggest that use of non-latex condoms is associated with higher rates of breakage
and slippage. [1]

While it may make sense to portray lambskin condoms as simply "ineffective" for the sake of
simplicity in educational settings, it is more accurate to state that there are solid
scientific reasons to expect lambskin condoms will be less effective in preventing STDs than
latex and poluyrethane, though the degree of such presumed decreased efficacy is not known.
It is unlikely that lambskin condoms would be "ineffective" in preventing STDs; for example,
the risk of transmitting a disease through depositing 1.5 to 5 mLs of ejaculate directly into a
partner's body cavity without the use of any barrier protection would be anticipated to be
greater than the risk involved in depositing such ejaculate into a lambskin barrier within a
body cavity, with the barrier subsequently removed from the body cavity along with all or
virtually all of the ejaculate.

Because the degree of efficacy of lambskin condoms has not been rigorously investigated and
because there exists a solid rationale to expect them to have decreased efficacy, it is
prudent to treat them as not effective. If one has concerns about the possibility of STD
transmission, it is prudent to use latex or polyurethane condoms, rather than lambskin
condoms.



[ edit ] Experimental



The Invisible Condom, developed at UniversitÃ© Laval in QuÃ©bec, Canada, is a gel that
hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum. In the lab, it
has been shown to effectively block HIV and herpes simplex virus. The barrier breaks down and
liquefies after several hours. The invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase, and has
not yet been approved for use. [26]

As reported on Swiss television news Schweizer Fernsehen on November 29 , 2006 , the German
scientist Jan Vinzenz Krause of the Institut fÃŒr Kondom-Beratung ("Institute for Condom
Consultation") in Germany recently developed a spray-on condom and is test-marketing it.
Krause says the advantages to his spray-on condom, which is reported to dry in about 5 seconds,
is that it is perfectly formed to each penis. [27] [28]



[ edit ] Effectiveness





[ edit ] In preventing pregnancy



The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of contraception , can be assessed two ways.
Perfect use or method effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and
consistently. Actual use , or typical use effectiveness rates are of all condom users,
including those who use condoms improperly, inconsistently, or both. Rates are generally
presented for the first year of use. [1] Most commonly the Pearl Index is used to calculate
effectiveness rates, but some studies use decrement tables . [29]

The typical use pregnancy rate among condom users varies depending on the population being
studied, ranging from 10â€“18% per year. [30] The perfect use pregnancy rate of condoms
is 2% per year. [1]

    Several factors account for typical use effectiveness being lower than perfect use
    effectiveness:

    - mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method

    

    - mistakes on the part of the user

    

    - conscious user non-compliance with instructions.

    



For instance, someone using condoms might be given incorrect information on what lubricants
are safe to use with condoms, or by mistake put the condom on improperly, or simply not bother to
use a condom.



[ edit ] In preventing STDs

    

        See also: HIV#Transmission

    



Condoms are widely recommended for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
They have been shown to be effective in reducing infection rates in both men and women. While
not perfect, the condom is effective at reducing the transmission of HIV, genital herpes,
genital warts, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other diseases. [31]

According to a 2000 report by the National Institutes of Health , correct and consistent use of
latex condoms reduces the risk of HIV / AIDS transmission by approximately 85% relative to
risk when unprotected. The same review also found condom use significantly reduces the risk
of gonorrhea for men. [32]

A 2006 study reports that proper condom use decreases the risk of transmission for human
papilloma virus by approximately 70%. [33] Another study in the same year found consistent
condom use was effective at reducing transmission of herpes simplex virus-2 also known as
genital herpes , in both men and women. [34]

Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur
even with a condom. Areas of the genitals hosting an infection may not be covered by a condom,
and as a result, some diseases can be transmitted by direct contact. [35] The primary
effectiveness issue with using condoms to prevent STDs, however, is inconsistent use. [14]



[ edit ] Causes of failure



 







Condom users may experience slipping off the penis after ejaculation, [36] breakage due to
faulty methods of application or physical damage (such as tears caused when opening the
package), or breakage or slippage due to latex degradation (typically from being past the
expiration date or being stored improperly). Even if no breakage or slippage is observed,
1â€“2% of women will test positive for semen residue after intercourse with a condom.
[37] [38]

Different modes of condom failure result in different levels of semen exposure. Failures
that occur during application generally pose no risk to the user. [39] One study found that
semen exposure from a broken condom was about half that of unprotected intercourse; semen
exposure from a slipped condom was about one-fifth that of unprotected intercourse. [40]

Standard condoms will fit almost any penis , although many condom manufacturers offer "snug"
or "magnum" sizes. Some studies have associated larger penises and smaller condoms with
increased breakage and decreased slippage rates (and vice versa), but other studies have
been inconclusive. [7] Ethnic differences may play a role in correct sizing; a small
exploratory portion of a 2006 Indian Council of Medical Research study concluded that
standard condom sizes were too large for many among India's men. [41]

Experienced condom users are significantly less likely to have a condom slip or break
compared to first-time users, although users who experience one slippage or breakage are at
increased risk of a second such failure. [42] An article in Population Reports suggests that
education on condom use reduces behaviors that increase the risk of breakage and slippage.
[43] A Family Health International publication also offers the view that education can
reduce the risk of breakage and slippage, but emphasizes that more research needs to be done to
determine all of the causes of breakage and slippage. [7]

Among couples that intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when
the couple does not use a condom. The couple may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not
have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to "take a chance."
This type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure (as opposed to method or
perfect use failure). [44]

Another possible cause of condom failure is sabotage . One motive is to have a child against a
partner's wishes or consent. [45] Some commercial sex workers report clients sabotaging
condoms in retaliation for being coerced into condom use. [46] Placing pinholes in the tip of
the condom is believed to significantly impact their effectiveness. [38] [47]

[ edit ] Female condoms





    

        Main article: female condom

    



Recently " female condoms " or " femidoms " have become available. They are larger and wider
than male condoms but equivalent in length. They have a flexible ring-shaped opening, and are
designed to be inserted into the vagina . They also contain an inner ring which aids insertion
and helps keep the condom from sliding out of the vagina during coitus . The condom is made from
polyurethane or nitrile .



[ edit ] Role in sex education



 







Condoms are often used in sexual education programs, because they have the capability to
reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when
used correctly. A recent American Psychological Association (APA) press release supported
the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education, saying " comprehensive
sexuality education programs... discuss the appropriate use of condoms ", and " promote
condom use for those who are sexually active ." [48]

In the United States, teaching about condoms in public schools is opposed by some religious
organizations. [49] Groups such as Planned Parenthood , which advocate family planning and
sexual education , argue that religious opposition to teaching about condoms results in
increased number of unwanted pregnancies and the spread of STDs.



[ edit ] Position of the Roman Catholic Church



The Catholic Church directly condemns only artificial birth control, and sexual acts aside
from intercourse between married heterosexual partners. The use of condoms to combat STDs is
not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among
high-ranking Catholic authorities. A few, such as Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels ,
believe the Catholic Church should actively support condoms used to prevent disease,
especially serious diseases such as AIDS . However, to date statements from the Vatican have
argued that condom-promotion programs encourage promiscuity, thereby actually
increasing STD transmission. [50] Papal study of the issue is ongoing, and a 200-page
document on the use of condoms to combat AIDS is being prepared for Pope Benedict 's review.
[51]



[ edit ] Use in infertility treatment



Common procedures in infertility treatment such as semen analysis and intrauterine
insemination (IUI) require collection of semen samples. These are most commonly obtained
through masturbation , but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special collection
condom to collect sperm emissions during sexual intercourse.

Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to
sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation. Also, compared to samples
obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm
counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason,
they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve
the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as IUI. [52]

The Catholic Church teaches that masturbation is immoral. For observant Catholics,
collection condoms are the only morally permissible way to obtain semen samples. Most
Catholics put two or three pinholes in the collection condom to avoid violating the Catholic
prohibition on artificial birth control. [47]

Condom therapy is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels
of antisperm antibodies. The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will
lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when
condom therapy is discontinued. However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase
subsequent pregnancy rates. [53]

[ edit ] Prevalence



 





Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Posecondom.jpg/100px-Posecondom.jpg



Condoms are more accessible in developed countries . In various cultures, a number of social
or economic factors make access to condoms prohibitive. In some cases, cultural beliefs may
cause some persons to shun condoms deliberately even when they are available. [54]

Furthermore, regardless of culture and availability, many men shun condoms simply because
they dislike using them. This dislike may be due to reduced sexual pleasure or to practical
problems, e.g. difficulty in sustaining an erection hard enough for effective condom use.

Because they are generally available without a prescription, and because they are very
effective in reducing the spread of sexually transmitted disease , condoms tend to be
especially popular among younger men, those who are not in exclusive partnerships, and
newly-formed monogamous couples. Often, once a steady relationship has deepened, the woman
may begin to use hormonal or some other type of highly effective contraceptive , at which time
condom use typically (though not always) comes to an end. Ideally, however, this should not
occur until blood tests have shown both partners to be free of infection.

Most research has revealed, through survey, four factors which establish the minimal use of
condoms: various encumbering beliefs, reduced sexual pleasure, adverse experiences, and
fears related to gender and tensions. New technology and beneficial studies have come forth
that combat these various factors, however only a small proportion of individuals
world-wide actually practice safe sex [2] . This noticeable gap has led several
investigators to analyze whether social factors might be involved such as a residual social
stigma attached to condoms.

In broad detail, social factors range from geographical location to race, and become as
specified as methamphetamine versus non-drug users, so correlations within this research
are not always strong and accurate, but it does establish that correlations do exist.



[ edit ] Geographic location



Several regions provide examples of social factors influencing the use of condoms within
their populace. Two examples which contrast the effects of similar problems are South Africa
and rural Lebanon .

South Africa has some of the highest HIV rates in the world, so there the statistics on condom
use are being studied heavily. As of 2001, the 21-25 year age group has the peak rate of
infection at 43.1%. [55] These studies became more specified and it was discovered that
despite all the information known today about HIV and the spread of infection, many young
people of the study did not feel that they were in danger of contracting this disease. In fact,
only 30% of people, males and females, felt they had any risk of contracting HIV at all. Of those
that said they felt there was any chance of contracting HIV, only 12.9% thought there was a
moderate chance, and 17.6% thought they had a good chance of infection . It seems that even
though the youth of South Africa do have a relatively high level of knowledge concerning the
risk factors of getting HIV, many feel that it simply won't happen to them. Many of the factors
found in South Africa apply to well developed countries of the world and these new findings
hopefully will help shape future campaigns against decreased condom use in the future.

Another end of the spectrum are the rural areas of Lebanon in the Middle East . Generally, the
use of condoms and other forms of contraceptives in the Middle East is low even though there is a
growing awareness of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS. [56] A study revealed that
only twenty-four percent of the women in the regions ever used a condom. A household survey was
also done on condom use which found that ninety-eight percent of women had indeed heard of
contraceptive methods, but only eighty-five percent of the women had heard of condoms. Some
things to keep in mind also are that women in this culture are not expected to have knowledge or
express openly knowledge of contraceptives or even sexuality. Also some background that is
needed on the group surveyed is that the marital fertility rate of the surveyed women were
about five children per woman, and each of the women had a different level of education. About
sixty-one percent had intermediate-level education, twenty percent had a primary
education, and eighteen percent had trouble reading or could not read at all. This provides
evidence that condom use varies dependent on social factors like the areaâ€™s cultural
background and education.

It should be noted that largely the variances in geographical location are highly affected by
culture and cultural beliefs, as well as class and race, but also have dynamic influences
resounding from economic yield for the area, use and expansion of communication , and other
criteria. These social factors can again be examined in South Africa and rural Lebanon:

An example is that in South Africa, it was discovered that condom availability is a problem for
young adults. [55] Although condoms are given away by local clinics, many participants
stated that there are instances when they found themselves without condoms because they
never know when they are going to need one. Thus, this higher economic region has properly
developed health services; they are just not being properly utilized by the public.

Opposing in the lower economic region of rural Lebanon, another reason for the lack of condom
use is that public health services and family planning services are very inadequately
developed. A health service that is trying to help is the Lebanese Family Planning
Association but their funding is very limited and recently they have not been able to increase
its budget to promote more complete reproductive health service.

Despite these specific social factors contributing to the differences between these
regions and others, most research has identified issues such as trust and gender power in
relationships and others as socially relevant to almost all countries worldwide.



[ edit ] Anti-condom trends



Studies have shown baby boomers are increasingly contracting sexually transmitted
diseases because they choose not to wear condoms. The analogy of "wearing a raincoat in a
shower" [57] describes, what is for many men, its anesthetic effect. A method to reduce this
effect is to retract the foreskin as much as possible while putting it on. Afterward, the
condom will have wrinkles that allow the foreskin to move more during intercourse.

Many have been married, and separated, and now have multiple sexual partners. [58] Several
reasons for this choice are given. Since the women are no longer capable of conceiving
children, they do not see the large risk in not protecting themselves, and thus the importance
of a condom becomes minimal. Also, since many of them have just come out of a long term
relationship , they are starting over and they are too uncomfortable with their new partner to
ask them to use a condom.

The practice of barebacking in Western gay culture is another example of a trend away from
condoms. Barebacking partners often know that they could reduce their risk of sexually
transmitted infection by using a condom, but choose not to do so. [59]

Laws and policies restricting condoms

Republic of Ireland

In the Republic of Ireland , condoms (and other contraceptives) were originally available
only to those with a doctor's prescription (finding a doctor willing to prescribe them was
very difficultâ€”almost impossible if one was unmarried) or via the black market
(usually smuggled from Northern Ireland ). This was later altered to being available only to
those over the age of 18 in pharmacies in 1985. Sale outside of pharmacies was only legalised in
1993, although stores such as the Virgin Megastore had in fact been selling them openly since
1988. The age limitations were also removed in 1993.



[ edit ] Philippines



The Philippines is a predominantly Roman Catholic nation, and the Catholic Church is a
powerful force in Philippine politics. The Church teaches that only natural family planning
methods are moral ways to prevent pregnancy, and opposes promotion of condoms for any
purpose.

While condoms are legal in the Philippines, the government will not promote them or pay for
their distribution. As of 2004, several local officialsâ€”including the mayor of
Manila â€”had banned distribution of condoms in government health facilities, and
some locations even ban government health workers from discussing condoms. [60]



[ edit ] Somalia



In 2003, a powerful Somali Muslim group banned selling or using condoms in Somalia . The
punishments for violating this include flogging . [61]



[ edit ] Iran



Condoms were never banned in Iran although their public sale was frowned upon after the
Islamic revolution of 1979. Despite being an Islamic theocracy, faced with a boom in the
population after the revolution, government has quietly encouraged and supported the use
and sale of condoms in the country in the past decade. They can now be legally obtained and in
fact Iran has one of the largest condom factories in the Middle East. [62]



[ edit ] Pakistan



Condoms were encouraged in Pakistan by the government by giving inexpensive government made
condoms under the "Sabaz Sitara" campaign (Green Star). However, they were of poor quality.
Condoms are widely available in pharmacies throughout the country and there is no
restriction on the use. Unlike many countries, the focus is on preventing pregnancy rather
than STDs . Condoms do not get the promotion they do in other countries because STDs are a much
smaller, but growing, concern. Other contraceptives such as birth control pills and IUD
devices are more promoted.



[ edit ] Disposal



Used condoms should be wrapped up in tissue and disposed of. Flushing down the toilet may cause
environmental damage. A new condom should be used if having sex more than once. [63]



[ edit ] Environmental impact



While biodegradable, latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly.
According to the Ocean Conservancy, these condoms cover the coral reefs and smother sea grass
and other bottom dwellers. The EPA also has expressed concerns that many animals might
mistake the litter for food. [64]

Condoms made of polyurethane, a plastic material, do not break down at all. There have been no
studies to determine if lubricated condoms take longer to biodegrade than non-lubricated
ones, but it is believed that their landfill mass is negligible. [65]



[ edit ] Etymology



Etymological theories for the word "condom" abound. It has been claimed to be from the Latin
word condon , meaning receptacle. [66] One author argues that "condom" is derived from the
Latin word condamina , meaning house. [67] It has also been speculated to be from the Italian
word guantone , derived from guanto , meaning glove. [68]

Folk etymology claims that the word "condom" is derived from a purported "Dr. Condom" or
"Quondam", who made the devices for King Charles II of England . There is no verifiable
evidence that any such "Dr. Condom" existed. [68] It is also hypothesized that a British army
officer named Cundum popularized the device between 1680 and 1717. [69] Other stories tell
the word "condom" has its root in the 16th century: in particular, when Catherine de Medici
married Henry II of France , she brought to France her minister Gondi and the architect
Bernardo Buontalenti. Gondi and Buontalenti started producing special waxed protections
to be used as condoms. The French soon called them "gondon"; "gondone" is today still used as a
synonym of "condom" in Genova , Italy; "goldone", another variation, is still used in Milan ,
Italy. [ citation needed ]

William E. Kruck wrote an article in 1981 concluding that, " As for the word 'condom', I need
state only that its origin remains completely unknown, and there ends this search for an
etymology. " [70] Modern dictionaries may also list the etymology as "unknown". [71]



[ edit ] Other terms



 



In North America condoms are also commonly known as prophylactics or rubbers . In Britain they
may be called French letters . [72]



Condoms may also be referred to using the manufacturer's name. In India they are called Nirodh
, a government-promoted brand, or KS (after a condom brand name KamaSutra).

A condom made from animal hide circa 1900



An Egyptian drawing of a condom being worn has been found to be 3,000 years old. It is unknown,
however, if the Egyptian pictured wearing the device intended to use it for contraception, or
for ritual purposes. [66]



In 16th century Italy, Gabriele Falloppio authored the first-known published description
of condom use for disease prevention. He recommended soaking cloth sheaths in a chemical
solution and allowing them to dry prior to use. [73]



The oldest condoms found (rather than just pictures or descriptions) are from 1640,
discovered in Dudley Castle in England . They were made of animal intestine, and it is believed
they were used for STD prevention. [66]



In 18th Spanish erotic verse, condoms are mentioned as available and sold in packages, albeit
under the veil of secrecy from various vendors. In a poem El arte de las putas by NicolÃ¡s
FernÃ¡ndez de MoratÃ­n the condom is attributed to the English, while its invention is
attributed to a friar who devised it for protection in a brothel.



In 19th century Japan, both leather condoms and condoms made of tortoise shells or horns were
available. [73]



The rubber vulcanization process was patented by Charles Goodyear in 1844, and the first
rubber condom was produced in 1855. [74] These early rubber condoms were 1-2mm thick and had
seams down the sides. [73] Although they were reusable, these early rubber condoms were also
expensive.



Distribution of condoms in the United States was limited by passage of the Comstock Act in
1873. This law prohibited transport through the postal service of any instructional
material or devices intended to prevent pregnancy. Condoms were available by prescription,
although legally they were only supposed to be prescribed to prevent disease rather than
pregnancy. [66] The Comstock Act remained in force until it was largely overturned by the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1936.



In 1912, a German named Julius Fromm developed a new manufacturing technique for condoms:
dipping glass molds into the raw rubber solution. This enabled the production of thinner
condoms with no seams. Fromm's Act was the first branded line of condoms, and Fromms is still a
popular line of condoms in Germany today. [74] By the 1930s, the manufacturing process had
improved to produce single-use condoms almost as thin and inexpensive as those currently
available. [73]



Condoms were not made available to U.S. soldiers in World War I , and a significant number of
returning soldiers carried sexually transmitted infections. During World War II , however,
condoms were heavily promoted to soldiers, with one film exhorting "Don't forget â€”
put it on before you put it in." [66] In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers
found a number of non-sexual uses for the devices, many of which continue to be utilized to this
day.



 



[ edit ] Other uses



Condoms excel as multipurpose containers because they are waterproof, elastic, durable,
and will not arouse suspicion if found. Ongoing military utilization begun during World War
II includes:

    

    - Tying a non-lubricated condom around the muzzle of the rifle barrel in order to prevent
    barrel fouling by keeping out detritus. [75]

    

    - The OSS used condoms for a plethora of applications, from storing corrosive fuel
    additives and wire garrotes (with the T-handles removed) to holding the acid component
    of a self-destructing film canister, to finding use in improvised explosives. [76]

    

    - Navy SEALs have used doubled condoms, sealed with neoprene cement, to protect
    non-electric firing assemblies for underwater demolitionsâ€”leading to the
    term "Dual Waterproof Firing Assemblies." [77]

    



Other uses of condoms include:

    

    - Condoms can be used to hold water in emergency survival situations. [78]

    

    - Condoms have also been used in many cases to smuggle cocaine and other drugs across
    borders and into prisons by filling the condom with drugs, tying it in a knot and then
    either swallowing it or inserting it into the rectum. These methods are very dangerous;
    if the condom breaks, the drugs inside can cause an overdose. [79]

    

    - In his book entitled Last Chance to See , Douglas Adams reported having used a condom to
    protect a microphone he used to make an underwater recording. According to one of his
    travelling companions, this is standard BBC practice when a waterproof microphone is
    needed but cannot be procured.

    

    - Condoms are used by engineers to keep soil samples dry during soil tests. [80]

    

    - Foot travelers in Amazonic South America wear condoms when wading through water to
    prevent a small catfish known as candirÃº from swimming into the urethra . The fish is
    attracted to the scent of blood and urine. [81]

    

    - Condoms are used as a one way valve by paramedics when performing a chest decompression
    in the field. The decompression needle is inserted through the condom, and inserted into
    the chest. The condom folds over the hub allowing air to exit the chest, but preventing it
    from entering. [82]

infamous onscreen threesome with Matt Dillon and Neve Campbell in Wild Things .



With her lusty image in tow, Richards became a Bond girl in 1999's The World Is Not Enough , and
after working with Charlie Sheen on Spin City , she married him. While several months pregnant
with their second child, Richards filed for divorce , later requesting a restraining order
against Sheen.



Tabloid attention grew when she soon began dating Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, who at
that time was married to her former friend Heather Locklear . Richards and Sheen have since
made peace , and she and Sambora have called it quits .

    Denise Richards: Five Fun Facts

    1 - Denise Richards was called "fish lips" for her prominent pout as a kid.

Richards Congratulates Charlie Sheen On Engagement Jul 18, '07 1:59 AM

for everyone



Image: http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/news/070723/denise_richards180.jpg
Denise Richards is extending her best wishes to ex-husband Charlie Sheen on his engagement to
girlfriend Brooke Mueller .



"I am genuinely happy for the two of them," Richards tells PEOPLE. "In fact, I sent them flowers
to congratulate them both. I've spent time with her, and my girls really like her. That's all
that matters to me."



Richards, 36, who filed for divorce from Sheen in 2005, has two daughters with him, Lola, 2, and
Sam, 3.



A Sheen family friend confirmed on Tuesday that the actor, 41, is now engaged to Mueller, a
29-year-old real estate investor he has been dating for more than a year.



This spring, Richards split with Richie Sambora after a nearly one-year relationship, but
she disputes a report that the breakup came about because Sambora, 48, wouldn't propose to
her.



"That is 100 percent completely false," she says. "There were a lot of rumors about our
relationship from day one and we broke up for many reasons. Richie is a great guy and an amazing
father. I really wish him well."



She also rejects another report that she hired a matchmaker. "That whole story is false. I did
not hire a matchmaker. But," she adds jokingly, "that's a great idea, maybe I should."

Scanlation Jul 16, '07 9:05 AM

for everyone

Scanlation (sometimes scanslation) is a term used for manga comics which have been scanned
and translated by fans and those who infringe copyright from its native language (usually
Japanese or Korean) to another language, commonly English, French or Spanish. Scanlations
are generally distributed for free via the Internet, either by direct download, BitTorrent
or IRC. The word scanlation comes from Scan and Translation. Like fansubs, their anime
counterparts, scanlations vary widely in the quality of translation, grammar, and
spelling. Scanlators are not professional translators, and as such, some may differ greatly
in quality. The lack of access to the original creator or editorial team behind the native
version is another barrier, something which licensed translations sometimes benefit from.
Because they depend on literary rather than spoken language skills, the comparative
complexities of written Japanese can present difficulties. A related issue is the practice
of scanlating from French or Chinese editions; nuances are lost through the layers of
translation. Although, scanlating manga at the most basic level, i.e., replacing Japanese
text with English, does not require significant editing skill, scanlation often goes far
beyond the basics. Many releases undergo extensive retouching and cleaning before being
distributed, though the effort may not be obvious. The written page also allows for extensive
yet non-intrusive liner notes in the margins or in additions.

Origins

At first, scanlations were undertaken as fan projects because there were few commercial
releases in the West, and importing manga was difficult. If one wanted imported manga,
several websites and mail order companies offered imported manga for fairly cheap prices.
Friends living in Japan would scanlate a manga for a friend. What may have started out as a favor
became a project, and grew from there. Eventually well-organized manga pirate groups were
formed, which usually had their own webpage as well as an IRC channel. The latter was arguably
more important in shaping the nascent scanlation community because IRC allowed real-time
interaction between the group staff and the target audience. IRC allowed the groups to easily
recruit new staff and also provided a means to distribute the scanlations via fileservers
(commonly called "fserves"). These fserves, which could be created by anyone in the IRC
channel, helped reduce the burden of distributing the manga scanlations. This act has been
recently called scanlation piracy .

The earliest organized manga scanlation pirates mostly had their channels located in the IRC
network DALnet . Examples of these groups include Mangaproject, Mangascreener,
Manga-Sketchbook, and Omanga. Network instability and a later ban on file transfers
eventually forced a move to a new home, mIRCx. This period was notable for probably having the
greatest centralization of manga channels, i.e. the vast majority of the channels were
located here. A sustained denial-of-service (DOS) attack caused the network to close shop.
This prompted a second move to the network Irchighway , where presently most channels are
located. However a fair number are located at Irctoo, as well as several at Rizon .

The scanlation scene is younger than the anime fansub one; most of the older organized groups
were founded after the year 2000. Recent years have been marked by an explosive increase in the
number of groups and consequently, scanlated manga available. Several sites including
Dailymanga, Manga Jouhou, and Baka-Updates list daily releases and maintain databases on
projects and scanlation groups. These sites can be used for tracking releases, searching by
genre, looking for synopses, and so on.

A few people today probably do scanlations simply because they want to see their favorite
manga unedited (no missing scenes, flipped panels, etc.), which has occurred especially for
manga that is aimed at a younger audience, such as the popular Dragon Ball series. The Dragon
Ball portion of the manga released in North America is now released uncut due to fan demand.

Recently, most new anime is fansubbed , and much of it is also sooner or later licensed for
distribution by companies around the world. However, due to the sheer number of manga series
in Japan (which has the largest market for comics in the world), this will probably never be the
case for manga. Scanlations are often done to translate manga to a language it never would be in
otherwise. A dramatic example being the few groups who focus on alternative and/or adult
oriented manga ( seinen and josei manga ) that tend to be overlooked by publishers in favor of
more popular shÅ�jo , shÅ�nen , or manga aimed at anime otaku .



[ edit ] Legal and ethical issues



By the letter of copyright law (such as the Berne Convention ), scanlation is illegal.

It is almost never prosecuted, and like fansubbing, scanlation is viewed by many fans as an
acceptable way to read manga which has had no official translation published in their own
language. Most scanlators, like fansubbers, stop distributing scanlations for manga that
have been licensed, and advise fans of the manga in question to buy the official translation.

Historically, copyright holders have not requested scanlators to stop distribution before
a work is licensed in the translated language; thus, scanlators have felt it is relatively
safe to translate and scan manga. However, they do so at their own risk. The risk was
accentuated on February 14 and October 31 , 2004 , when Kodansha, Ltd. sent cease and desist
letters to the scanlator site Snoopycool . Of late, fansubbers have also received such
notifications, like Media Factory 's request to stop the translation of their works, such as
Gankutsuou and Genshiken . This may signal a change in the attitudes of original copyright
holders in regards to how much they tolerate fan-translated material.

On the other hand, licensing companies (such as Del Rey Manga , TOKYOPOP , and VIZ Media ) have
used the response to various scanlations as a factor in deciding which manga to buy licenses to
translate. Said TOKYOPOP's Steve Kleckner in regard to scanlation, "And, hey, if you get
2,000 fans saying they want a book you've never heard of, well, you gotta go out and get it." [1] .
Toren Smith (a long-time translator) is quoted in his blog as saying "I know from talking to
many folks in the industry that scanslations DO have a negative effect. Many books that are on
the tipping point will never be legally published because of scanslations." [2] .

On occasion, some scanlators feel that certain manga series need to be translated by fans to
preserve it from what is perceived as abusive or harmful censorship or editing. Some will
continue scanlating regardless of licensing, while others will restart stopped
translation if they feel professional translation companies are not doing a series
properly. Most unhappy fans who with this feeling tend to follow the motto "If they don't do it
right, then they don't have the right to do it (exclusively)."

Scanlators do not have access to the original editors, creators, or the artwork itself.
Licensed editions generally have a consistently high level of quality due to these extra
options when works are translated.

In recent years, web sites have cropped up that attempt to profit from the work that scanlation
groups do for free, by providing the more technologically challenged manga fans
easier-to-use HTTP downloads for a monthly fee. Most people in the community regard this as
highly unethical.



[ edit ] Censorship



Western cultural norms differ from Japanese cultural norms. In the early days of localized
releases of manga, story editing and minor censoring occurred in some series, such as the
original American release of Dragon Ball . While large scale editing is no longer a common
practice of translation companies, it still occurs regularly on a small scale. Real story
changes are not common and rarely occur at all, though name changes into a local vernacular do
infrequently happen. On the other hand, visual editing is fairly commonplace, though its
degree varies.

Many popular manga series, to varying degrees, will show topless nudity. Displays of female
undergarments (namely bras and panties ) are also very common. It is a regular translation
company practice to simply white-out the nipples on exposed breasts or draw some cover over
the showing undergarment.

Most fans that buy licensed manga from companies accept this unobtrusive censorship,
usually because most licensed series are not of a distinctly strong mature theme. There are
however marked exceptions.

In the American release of the manga series titled I"s by the popular author Masakazu Katsura ,
exposed nipples were censored, though not with traditional white-outs but instead by
placing small five-pointed stars over the offending nipples. This obvious and obtrusive
censorship received strong criticism by avid fans of Katsura's work.

Similar was the release of the Tenjho Tenge manga by DC Comics' CMX . CMX decided to heavily
censor and alter the content of the Tenjho Tenge series due to its prevalent 'adult' themes.
These edits mostly consisted of covering of exposed undergarments and mild nudity. This was
done to enable a change in the target age group market. Without such edits the T (13 years and
older) rating could not have been achieved. The previous equivalent rating in Japan would
have been considerably higher if directly translated into American ratings.



[ edit ] Community



The scanlation community is similar to the fansubs community and the video game fan
translation community, with various degrees of overlap. Many scanlation readers also watch
fansubs, and were often introduced to scanlations some way or another through their interest
in anime. A fair share of these people, who have the opportunity to directly compare the two
media, often regard the manga superior to the anime of a particular series. This is often based
on the observation that most anime tend to slow down the pace of the original storyline by using
methods such as prolonging the "recap from previous episodes" period in the beginning of the
show, the use of long holding, meaningless frames and the use of "recap episodes" in an attempt
to stretch the length of the entire series. These "dragging" technique can often be seen in
long running anime series such as Dragonball and Naruto.

Some scanlation readers fear their favorite series will be licensed and be poorly translated
or censored by the licensor. Others hope that the fanbase generated by the scanlation will
encourage licensing of the work so they can purchase English-language tankÅ�bon of the
manga.

Many fans, however, disagree with scanlations on the basis that there is a simple alternative
that supports the creators of the manga : instead of editing the translations into digitized
images, they can be placed online as a stand-alone text file which can be printed and used to
read a legitimately purchased manga tankÅ�bon. This was the norm in the earlier days of
fandom; though it is still a copyright violation, it is a morally preferable option for many.



[ edit ] Process



The scanlation process involves several steps, starting with procurement of source
material and ending with distribution. While the details of each step may vary from group to
group, the basic procedures are essentially the same.



[ edit ] 1. Scanning



Scanning, simply put, involves scanning the manga, thus transforming the printed page into
an image which can easily be manipulated. The scanner (as the person in charge of scanning is
called) is often the one that purchases the manga, which is generally either a manga magazine
or a tankÅ�bon . Scanning from a magazine has the advantage that it can provide the very
latest chapter of the series. However, since most manga magazines use low quality,
newsprint-grade paper and a cheap printing process, those scans are often poor.
TankÅ�bons, on the other hand, provide significantly superior scans, at the cost of
waiting until they are actually available for purchase. Since most tankÅ�bons are simply
compilations of the serial magazine chapters that have been published so far, that wait can
range anywhere from a couple of months to more than a year. Because of this, a group might
release an early low-quality (LQ) version based on a manga magazine and later follow it up with
a high-quality (HQ) tankÅ�bon-based version. However, this approach is
labor-intensive, so most groups stick with a single source.

In order to get scans of better quality, many scanners debind the magazine or tankÅ�bon,
i.e. separate the individual pages from the spine. (Methods include cutting the spine
carefully, microwaving the whole book or ironing the spine, to loosen the glue.) This allows
the pages to lie flat against the scanner bed, preventing the formation of shadowing
artifacts that would normally occur in the middle due to the presence of a spine. One major
advantage is that it allows better scanning of two-page spreads, so that they can more easily
be fused during the editing step.



[ edit ] 2. Translation



The second step in scanlation is the key step -- translation . The scans of the manga are
forwarded to a translator, who translates the manga to a target language . Typically the
source language is Japanese , but Chinese is a close second due to the large Chinese manga
market and often greater availability of Chinese translators. In recent years, scanlators
who translate Korean manga ( manhwa ) into English have also emerged. The target language for
most scanlations is English, followed by French . Scanlation groups in other languages such
as German or Spanish exist but are of small number.

As well as being the most important step, translation is also the most difficult. Ideally, the
translator is fluent in both the source and target languages so that beyond conveying the
basic meaning, s/he can recognize nuances and subtleties and find appropriate equivalents
in the target language. Particularly if Japanese is the source, the translator should be
familiar with the Japanese culture , as manga often contain cultural references and
allusions. To compound translation difficulties further, Japanese manga is loaded with
puns and wordplays that are essentially impossible to translate. Given all of these demands
on the translator, it is not surprising that translations vary widely in quality. Some
translations are too literal and are said to be too "stiff", whereas some translations are too
liberal and lose the original meaning. A good translation balances the two extremes; it
maintains fidelity to the original language (not too lax) while being easily comprehensible
at the same time (not too literal).

Translators are usually the scarcest resource in the scanlation process, especially
Japanese to English (J-E) translators. Given the wider availability of people fluent in both
Chinese and English, some groups translate from the Chinese version of a manga instead of the
original Japanese. This form of translation is ultimately inferior to a direct
Japanese-English translation since some meaning is invariably lost in the first
translation. The use of a Chinese-based translation is deemed acceptable in many cases
simply because of the lack of J-E translators.

To facilitate greater understanding among scanlation readers, notes are sometime placed on
the pages themselves (liner notes) or as an addendum at the end of a chapter. Liner notes are
particularly useful in clarifying puns & wordplays that are lost in the translation. Sound
effects (SFX) translations are also a form of liner notes and are positioned to correspond to
particular panels. End notes on the other hand have more space and allow longer and more
detailed explanations when necessary. Most scanlations do not have end notes.



[ edit ] 3. Editing



After translation is finished, the text and scans are forwarded to the editor. The basic job of
the editor is to remove the Japanese text from the scans and replace it with the corresponding
English translation (this discussion assumes a J-E scanlation). This requires an image
editor such as Adobe Photoshop (which is the overwhelming favorite).

Scanlation groups have different approaches to editing. Some groups hand the unedited manga
scans (called "raws") to a single person (the "editor"), who then is entirely in charge of
producing the final scanlation. Other groups have more specialized subdivisions. For
example, the raws can be first passed to a "cleaner" who processes the scans to make them more
presentable. Afterwards, the scan is passed to an "editor" who removes the Japanese text and
processes the scans so that they are ready for the " typesetter ", who places the translation on
the scans. Combinations of these roles are common, for example the scanner might also be the
cleaner, the editor is the typesetter; in extreme cases one person might take on all roles
(including translation) and release scanlations single-handedly. The specifics of the
process are unique to the team or editor but several basic approaches can be pointed out.

A raw typically first undergoes cleaning . This includes leveling , in which the gray artifact
on white areas (mostly a product of the paper used in books/magazines) are corrected and
converted to white; the black areas (which tend to be gray instead of black due to the printing
process) are also adjusted to a purer black. An editor then corrects any unwanted rotation of
the original artwork, aligning it to vertical/horizontal as well as possible, and possibly
even corrects any skewing of the page. Adjusting the margins so that they are equal is also
common practice. The raw can then be resized to the desired height and width, or be kept at
original size throughout the editing process. After these preliminary steps have been
completed, the translation can be edited in. Once the cleaning, the edits are saved in a
specific image format. The JPEG format used to be the format of choice (and still is for color
images) but it has been increasingly superseded by PNG , which compresses losslessly
(however, small file size is obtained by limiting the available number of different shades to
around 32, which is enough for most types of manga, except a few richer pages).

The last step is Quality Checking (QCing) in which all aspects of the edit e.g. grammar ,
spelling , font choices, text placement, and any simple editing mistakes such as
over-leveling during the cleaning process described. are reviewed. The quality checker is
often someone with experience in editing but is too busy to do a full-scale chapter. The end
result is a final edit which is then packaged in a compressed format for convenience, usually
either ZIP or RAR . Usually, an additional credits page is included but some place credits
within the manga itself, such as in the title page or at the margins.

Scanlations differ very widely in editing quality. Some groups are content to release
poorly-edited magazine-based scans filled with grammatical and spelling errors, while
others release material of exceptional quality. These are often termed LQ (low-quality) and
HQ (high-quality) releases respectively (the HQ label was originally created by
Mangaproject to distinguish their scanlations). In this regard some general principles
apply. First, LQ scanlations are typically released quickly while HQ ones are slower to come.
This has mainly to do with the time it takes to do an HQ release, e.g. editing SFX, doing several
proofreading cycles, etc., although using slower-released tankÅ�bons is another
factor.

Second, each group has its own measure of acceptable quality, which changes infrequently.
That is why some scanlation teams can be consistently branded as "HQ groups" while others are
regarded as "LQ groups." For some teams, it is probably not an issue of quality but speed that is
their primary concern. This is especially true for multiple groups working on a single
series. Here the goal is to beat others to a release, with quality only a secondary
consideration. Using scans from manga magazines does not necessarily condemn a release to be
an LQ one, well-made magazine-based scans can be edited to make them look as good as poorly made
tankÅ�bon-based ones. In summary, the factors that influence the quality of a scanlation
would include the source of the scans, the skill of the editors, and the amount of time and
effort the group is willing to spend on the manga.

One common misconception regarding the editing step of scanlation is that "it's easy and just
about anybody can do it". For high-quality releases, this is quite far from the truth. Editing
requires a variety of skills that are needed to handle the unique nature of manga. For example,
Japanese text is commonly placed over artwork. Since Japanese characters are broader than
average English characters (letters or numbers), placing English text over erased Japanese
text will leave significant and glaring gaps. The editor corrects this by reconstructing the
said areas, a skill often termed redrawing or rebuilding . Manga is also characterized by
ubiquitous sound effects that often appear as large Japanese characters slapped over the
artwork. Some groups translate and edit these SFX, but many do not because of the tedious
nature in redrawing the backgrounds so obscured. Another example is two-page spreads, where
continuous artwork is spread over two pages. Even if the pages of the spread are unbound from
the spine and scanned properly, a perfect fit is almost impossible to achieve. The editor is
then tasked to piece together the spread, using various tools such as the clone brush , bezier
curves and pen tool , etc. All of these image manipulations can only be appreciated if the
original scan and final product are compared. Since most scanlation readers do not have
access to the original scans, they often underestimate the extent of editing involved.



[ edit ] 4. Distribution



The final step in the scanlation process involves delivering the release to the target
audience (termed " leechers " in some cases, especially for the more popular series), and
include direct download ( HTTP ), FTP , IRC , and Bittorrent (BT). Scanlation teams may offer
direct downloads on their website or on mirror sites , and sites not maintained by scanlators
also offer direct downloads . Since most teams also have IRC channels , they are utilized as an
avenue for distribution via fileservers (" fserves ") and bots . However transfers via IRC are
often plagued by difficulties in sending and receiving, which stem from firewalls ,
hostmasks , and improperly-configured fserves. Manga scanlations are also infrequently
available via FTP, but usually not as a primary distribution method. The information needed
to access these FTPs is available only within IRC. Recently Bittorrent has emerged as a
popular method of distributing releases and is advantageous in that downloaders can help by
sharing their bandwidth. Given all these methods of distribution, manga scanlations are
easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection and has the distinct advantage over
anime in being much smaller in size. Single chapters may be as small as 2-3 megabytes and rarely
exceed 15-20 MB; an average chapter usually falls within the 5-8 MB range.

Break Jul 12, '07 3:35 AM

for everyone

dapat dari Wikipedia... suruh orang layan cerita nih... heh... heh...

Prison Break is an American serial drama television series that premiered on the Fox Network
on August 29 , 2005 . The story revolves around a man who was sentenced to death for a crime he did
not commit, and his brother's elaborate plan to help him escape his death sentence at Fox
River. Created by Paul Scheuring , the show is produced by Adelstein-Parouse Productions in
association with Original Television and 20th Century Fox Television . The current
executive producers are Paul Scheuring, Matt Olmstead , Dawn Parouse, Marty Adelstein, Neal
Moritz, and Brett Ratner . [1] Its theme music is composed by Ramin Djawadi , and was nominated
for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2006. [2]

Currently, two seasons of the show have been aired. Due to its immense popularity in its key
demographics, the show was renewed by Fox for a third season, [3] even though it was originally
conceived to have only two seasons. The uniqueness of Prison Break is attributed to its
serialized story structure, a similar format used by Lost and 24 , and to its setting, as very
few television series were primarily set and filmed in a prison. [4] Its success and
recognition as a prison drama revived interest in the genre. [5]

Production



[ edit ] Conception



Prison Break began as a concept (a man deliberately getting himself sent to prison in order to
help someone else escape) suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to
produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring thought it was a good idea, he was
initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it
into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother and
began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to
the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term
possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was
also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series.
[6] Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries , which drew the
interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the
Worlds . Thus, the miniseries never materialized. Following the huge popularity of
serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24 , the Fox Network had a change of
heart and backed the production in 2004. [7] The pilot episode was filmed a year after
Scheuring wrote the script and five months later, the show was picked up as a series. [8]



[ edit ] Casting



The premiere had eight major speaking roles with star billing . The casting process for the
role of Michael Scofield , one of the series' protagonists, began several weeks before
production. In an interview, Paul Scheuring recalled that most of the actors who tested for
the role "would come in playing mysterious, but it was so cheesy and false." [9] A week before
the start of production, Wentworth Miller auditioned for the role and impressed Scheuring
with his performance; he was cast the following day. [10]

Dominic Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was
the last actor to join the original cast. [10] Purcell auditioned for the role of Lincoln
Burrows , a death-row inmate and the brother of Michael Scofield, while he had a recurring role
as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore . Since working on John Doe , Purcell has had a great
relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break . [6] At first,
Scheuring thought Purcell was "too much of a pretty boy" after he went to the audition with his
hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell won the role and arrived on the set on the first day of
filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series'
two leading actors. [9]

Upon receiving the pilot script, Amaury Nolasco 's first thought was that it was "one of those
failed pilots that the network didn't really want" since most of the series pilots would have
started production by that time. Admitting that he doesn't like to read, Nolasco was amazed
that the script was a "huge page-turner". Prior to his last audition for the role of Fernando
Sucre , Nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was
their favourite choice. Subsequently, he was cast in the role. [11]

After reading the pilot script, Wade Williams initially did not want to portray the role of
Brad Bellick because the character was "horrible and despicable". His reluctance stemmed
from being the father of a four-year-old daughter. However, his manager persuaded him to
audition for the role and Williams landed the role of Bellick. [11]

Sarah Wayne Callies was the first actress the producers saw at the audition for the role of Sara
Tancredi [10] and was also the first to become a principal cast member. [12] After her final
audition at the 20th Century Fox lot, Callies came back outside to find that she had left her
keys in the ignition inside her locked car. While she waited for the AAA to arrive, she received
a call from her agent that she had been cast. [11]

The remaining original cast included Robin Tunney , Marshall Allman , and Peter Stormare , who
were cast as Veronica Donovan , L. J. Burrows , and John Abruzzi respectively.



[ edit ] Music



The theme music of Prison Break and the incidental music of each episode are composed by Ramin
Djawadi . In France , rapper Faf Larage's song, Pas Le Temps is used by television network M6 to
replace the show's original music in the title sequence , which generated publicity and
helped to localize the show. [13] A German reindition of the French song is used in the title
sequence in Germany ("Ich glaub an Dich" by Azad and Adel Tawil). Similarly, "Prison Break
Anthem", performed by Kaye Styles, was written especially to be used in the title sequence in
Belgium .



[ edit ] Broadcast history



The first season of Prison Break premiered on the Fox Network in the United States on August 29 ,
2005 at 9:00 pm ET and went on hiatus on November 28 , 2005 . After the show resumed on March 20 ,
2006 , it was moved to an earlier timeslot to 8:00 pm ET, followed by 24 . Season 1 reached its
completion on May 15 , 2006 . The second season was aired from August 21 , 2006 to April 2 , 2007
while retaining its Monday 8:00 pm ET timeslot. The third season is scheduled to premiere on
September 17 , 2007 . [14]

[ edit ] Plot summary

The first season consists of 22 episodes. Lincoln Burrows is accused of the murder of Terrence
Steadman , who is the brother of the female Vice President of the United States . With strong
evidence supporting the charges of first degree murder and aggravated discharge of a firearm
against him, Lincoln is sentenced to death and is sent to the Fox River State Penitentiary to
await his execution. Lincoln's brother, Michael Scofield , is convinced of Lincoln's
innocence and hatches an escape plan. After installing himself at Fox River, time works
against Michael as he must overcome various obstacles and make the right connections among
the inmates and prison staff to be successful in breaking out his brother. The protagonists
are aided by Veronica Donovan , who begins to investigate the conspiracy that put Lincoln in
jail. However, they are hindered by covert agents, who belong to an organization known as The
Company .

The second season of Prison Break consists of 22 episodes and directly follows from the first
season finale. It begins eight hours after the prison escape from Fox River State
Penitentiary, focusing mainly on the escapees. New characters are introduced, including
federal agent Alexander Mahone , who is assigned to track down and capture the eight escapees.
Series creator Paul Scheuring describes the second season as " The Fugitive times eight" and
likens it to the "second half of The Great Escape ". [15] The fugitives journey to locations
across America with the authorities close behind them as they each pursue their individual
goals. The secondary plot involving the conspiracy develops as The Company continues their
plan to locate and eliminate Lincoln Burrows and others who get in their way. Much of the
storyline concerning the conspiracy concludes by the season finale.

Series creator Paul Scheuring has commented that the third season will consist of most of the
original cast with new additions and that the overall theme will be "redemption". [6] The plot
will continue from the second season finale, where most of the main characters have ended up in
Panama . Although the conspiracy storyline has not finished, the third season's plot will be
"as different in tone as Season 2 was from Season 1".



[ edit ] Filming location



The majority of the first season of Prison Break was filmed on location at Chicago , Illinois .
[16] After it was closed down in 2002, Joliet Prison became the set of Prison Break in 2005, and
was immortalized as Fox River State Penitentiary on screen. Scenes set in Lincoln's cell, the
infirmary and the prison yard were all shot on location at the prison. [17] Lincoln's cell is
the same one that John Wayne Gacy was incarcerated in. Most of the production crew refused to
enter the cell, thinking that it was haunted. [16] The cells that housed the general prison
population were specially built with three tiers whereas the actual cells located in Joliet
Prison only had two tiers and were smaller. [17] Exterior scenes were filmed in areas around
Chicago , Woodstock , and Joliet in Illinois . Other locations included O'Hare International
Airport in Chicago and Toronto , Ontario in Canada . Prison Break spent $2 million per episode
in the state of Illinois, which cost them a total of $24million in the 2005 year. [16]

Renewed for a second season, Prison Break resumed filming on June 15 , 2006 in Dallas, Texas due
to the close proximity of rural and urban settings. [18] Locations within a 30-minute radius
of Dallas were chosen which included Little Elm , Decatur and Mineral Wells . [19] Many of these
locations were used to represent various American towns. [20] For the final three episodes of
the second season, filming took place in Pensacola , Florida to represent Panama . [21] Each
episode takes eight days to film and approximately $1.4 million goes to the local economy per
episode. [22] The show is expected to spend in excess of $50 million in Dallas. [15]

    Characters

        Main article: List of Prison Break characters

    



Main characters

Although each season consists of more than ten regularly appearing characters, only seven
characters have appeared consistently throughout the series so far.

The series' protagonists are Lincoln Burrows (played by Dominic Purcell ) and Michael
Scofield (played by Wentworth Miller ). Lincoln is a high school dropout and a convicted
felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged with the murder of the Vice President of the
United States 's brother. Michael is Lincoln's brother and worked as a structural engineer
before devoting full-time to his brother's case. In order to save his brother's life, Michael
creates an elaborate plan to help his brother escape from prison. Over the course of the
series, Michael and Lincoln are shown to be protective of each other. They are the only
characters to have appeared in every episode to date.

Other

Veronica Donovan (played by Robin Tunney ) is Michael and Lincoln's childhood friend and
decides to review Lincoln's case at Michael's insistence. She becomes Lincoln's lawyer and
appears as a major character in the first season and a minor character in the second season. L.
J. Burrows (played by Marshall Allman ) is the teenage son of Lincoln Burrows and is greatly
affected by his father's death sentence. He is forced into hiding after he becomes the target
of the people who wants Lincoln dead.

After he was incarcerated, John Abruzzi (played by Peter Stormare ) became a prominent figure
at Fox River State Penitentiary due to his role as the leader of a Chicago mafia. He agrees to
provide an escape plane for Michael in exchange for the location of the eyewitness to his
crimes, Otto Fibonacci. He appears regularly in the first half of the first season and makes
selected appearances towards the end of the first season and the beginning of the second
season. Benjamin Miles "C-Note" Franklin (played by Rockmond Dunbar ) is introduced as a Fox
River prisoner, who becomes suspicious of Michael. He later forces Michael to include him in
the escape. Along with T-Bag, C-Note is seen as Michael's opponent in the first season,
although he is a more sympathetic and likable character than T-Bag.

The second season introduces a new major character, FBI Special Agent Alexander Mahone
(played by William Fichtner ), who is assigned to locate the fugitives. Mahone is
intellectually matched with Michael and his background unfolds as the series progresses.
Four major characters will be introduced in the third season: Luchero (played by Robert
Wisdom ), Betty Crocker (played by Jodi Lyn O'Keefe ), Sofia (played by Danay Garcia ) and
Whistler (played by Chris Vance ). Luchero is a prisoner at Sona and a Panamanian drug kingpin
while Betty Crocker is an operative for the Company. [23] Sofia is the girlfriend of Whistler,
who is incarcerated in the same prison as Michael. [24]

Major recurring characters from the first season include Fox River's Warden Henry Pope
(played by Stacy Keach ) and lawyer Nick Savrinn (played by Frank Grillo ). Charles
Westmoreland (played by Muse Watson ) is a veteran of the prison having served 32 years and has a
daughter, who is dying of cancer. Michael believes he is D. B. Cooper and has hidden $5 million
outside the prison, which forms a subplot of the second season. Two other Fox River prisoners
who join in Michael's escape are David "Tweener" Apolskis (played by Lane Garrison ) and
Charles "Haywire" Patoshik (played by Silas Weir Mitchell ). Additionally, some of the
walk-on characters who played prisoners actually served time at the Joliet Prison. [12]

The character of Terrence Steadman was played by two actors, first by John Billingsley in the
first season, then by Jeff Perry in the second season as Billingsley was cast as a regular on the
ABC series The Nine . Steadman has few appearances in the series, nevertheless, the character
is at the center of the conspiracy which caused Lincoln Burrows to be charged with his murder.
Caroline Reynolds (played by Patricia Wettig ) is the sister of Terrence Steadman, who has
ambitions to become the President of the United States, which she later achieves.

A major recurring character in the second season was introduced in the form of William Kim aka
Bill Kim (played by Reggie Lee ), who has orders from the Company to oversee the actions of
Mahone and Kellerman.

[ edit ] Reception in the USA



The following seasonal rankings are based on average total viewers per episode as recorded by
Nielsen Media Research . The recording period begins in late September (the start of the U.S.
network television season) and ends in late May.

Season Broadcast period Timeslot Ranking Viewers (in millions) 1 2005â€“2006 Monday

Fox backed Prison Break with a large advertising campaign. The show debuted on August 29 , 2005
, to an estimated audience of 10.5 million viewers. Fox has not seen such success for
summertime Monday numbers since Melrose Place and Ally McBeal aired in September of 1998. The
two-hour premiere was credited as two episodes by the network. [27] The premiere was the
seventh most watched show in America that week according to Nielsen Research, [28] ranking
first in both the 18â€“49 and 18â€“34 demographics . [29] The strong debut
performance was also matched by various positive reviews. According to The New York Times ,
Prison Break was "more intriguing than most of the new network series, and it certainly is one
of the most original", complimenting on its ability to create a "suspenseful thriller" and
its "authentic look". [30] Entertainment Weekly has dubbed it as one of the best new shows of
2005. [31] On the other hand, The Washington Post criticized the show for its "somber
pretentiousness" and "uniformly overwrought" performances. [32] The show regularly
attracted an average audience of 10 million viewers each week and led the debuts of television
in the 2005 American fall season. [33] Prison Break was originally planned for a 13-episode
run, but was extended to include an extra nine episodes due to its popularity. [7]

The premiere of the second season of Prison Break obtained an average of 9.4 million viewers,
down from 10.5 million for the series premiere in August 2005. [34] The decline was steeper
among young-adult viewers with a decrease of 20 percent in the 18â€“49 demographic
compared to its series premiere, but its household rating grew from 3.6% to 3.9% during the
last half hour. [35] A critic from USA Today commented on the "harebrained absurdities that
have swamped this show", and blamed the writers for being "incredibly lazy" for the
continuous use of the tattoo as an "all-purpose plot fix". [36] Contrastingly, Detroit Free
Press commended the second season premiere on matching the standard set by the first season,
which delivered a "rocking good entertainment" due to its "motley crew of cellblock
characters" and the "taut, ingenious storytelling of series creator Paul T. Scheuring and
his staff." [37] The second season obtained its largest audience on the original airdate of
the episode, " Chicago " with an average of 10.1 million viewers. [38] On the other hand, the
season finale on its original airdate received one of the lowest audiences in the series'
history, obtaining an average of 8.01 million viewers with 5% household rating and 8%
household share. [39]



[ edit ] Reception outside the USA



As the only new television series to be positioned in the top 20 television shows of 2005/2006
in Canada , Prison Break achieved an average of 876,000 in the key demographic of 18â€“49
and 1.4 million viewers nationally for its first season. [40] During its second season, the
show has consistently retained the highest number of viewers in its timeslot in Canada.

Following a huge advertising campaign on Australian television network, Seven , which hyped
the success the show found in North America , Prison Break premiered on February 1 , 2006 to an
average audience of 1.94 million as well as making its peak at 2.09 million viewers. [41] The
hype of the show was later complemented with encore screenings in the second week, before
being set into a concrete time of 8:30 pm on Wednesday nights. The first season attracted an
overall average of 1.353 million viewers. [42] The second season, promoted by the network as
Prison Break - On the Run , [43] premiered on January 31 , 2007 at a new time of 9:30 pm, with
1.226 million viewers (47% share). [44] With ratings dropping consistently throughout the
second season, Seven decided to "fast-track" the third season, along with the second season
of Heroes , so that the episodes run on the same day as in the U.S. in an effort to win back viewers
watching episodes before their airdate on DVDs or the internet. [45] The popularity of the
show was also evident in New Zealand , where Prison Break won the People's Choice Award for
Favourite New Television Drama. [46]

In Europe, the series premiered in France on August 31 , 2006 with an average of 5.5 million
viewers (25.8% share). [47] Prior to its second season premiere in France, Prison Break was
heavily advertised by its local television network, M6 and Fox, which was aided by the
appearances of Wentworth Miller, Dominic Purcell and Paul Scheuring at MIPCOM in Cannes .
[48] The second season premiered on November 8 , 2006 to 7.5 million viewers (29.0% share),
making it one of the most watched programs for the 2006 year in France. [49] In Poland , the
series premiered on January 28 , 2007 to 7 million viewers (38% share) making it the highest
rated episode of any foreign series in Polsat history. It was also the highest rated show of the
week in the 16â€“49 demographic (46% share). [50] Although Prison Break was much
publicized in Germany , it premiered to a lower-than-expected audience on June 21 , 2007 with
only 13.5% market share, which was well below television network RTL Television 's regularly
strong prime-time performance. 1.32 million viewers were recorded among the 14 to 49 years
old demographic. [51]

The first season's broadcast in Hong Kong on TVB Pearl during September 5 , 2006 and January 21 ,
2007 was a success, receiving the largest audience Hong Kong has ever had for a foreign drama
and broke the record previously set by The X-Files . The series premiere obtained an average of
260,000 viewers while the first season finale obtained an average of 470,000 viewers (7.3%)
and peaked at 590,000 (9.1%). [52] Due to its overwhelming response in Hong Kong, TVB Pearl
purchased the copyright of Season 2 and started to air it from March 6 , 2007 . The second season
premiere received an average of 270,000 viewers while peaking at 310,000. TVB Pearl expects
the second season's ratings to exceed the ratings of Season 1. [53] On the other hand, Prison
Break is not imported by China but the series is available for free downloads, online TV, as
well as on the black market on bootleg DVDs among many other American TV shows. [54]



[ edit ] Ratings



Due to its storyline and setting, Prison Break' s target audience is the 18â€“34 age
group. The show contains adult content including violence, coarse language, sexual and drug
references. Concerns have been raised by the Parents Television Council in the United States
about the timeslot in which Prison Break is broadcast (8:00 pm ET ) since the show features
some scenes which contain graphic content. [55] The series is given a TV-14 rating in both the
United States and Canada.

A similar rating is also used in other countries. Prison Break is rated M in Australia , A+18 in
Chile , PG in Hong Kong , 18PL in Malaysia , 12 in The Netherlands , PG13V in South Africa and 15 in
the United Kingdom . In France , the broadcasting watchdog, Conseil Superieur de
l'Audiovisuel (CSA), also complained that the violence in some episodes exceeded the amount
allowed for its rating, which is "not for under 10s". Under France's regulations, any higher
ratings would move the show away from its current primetime timeslot to a later timeslot.
However, their decision to change the rating will only affect the first season, which has
already been broadcast, and not the second season. [56]



[ edit ] Awards



Following a successful airing of the series' first thirteen episodes, Prison Break was
nominated for its first award, the 2005 People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama. The
other nominees in the same category were Commander in Chief and Criminal Minds . Prison Break
won the award in January 2006 and it is the only award the show has won to date. Also in January
2006, the show had two nominations at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards , which were Best Drama
Television Series and Best Actor in a Drama Television Series for Wentworth Miller 's
performance. The show's lead actor, Wentworth Miller, received another nomination for his
performance in the first season at the 2005 Saturn Awards for Best Actor on Television .
Likewise, the series was nominated for 2005 Saturn Award for Best Network Television Series.
At the 2006 Television Critics Association Awards , the show was nominated for Best New Drama
Series. Nominations for technical awards include the 2006 Eddie Award for Best Edited
One-Hour Series for Commercial Television ( Mark Helfrich for the pilot episode) and the 2006
Primetime Emmy award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music ( Ramin Djawadi ). In December
2006, Robert Knepper was nominated for the 2006 Satellite Award for Best Actor in a Supporting
Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television.



[ edit ] Controversy



On October 24 , 2006 , it was reported by the Associated Press that Donald and Robert Hughes
filed a lawsuit against Fox Broadcasting Company and the show's executive producer and
creator, Paul Scheuring, for copyright infringement , seeking unspecified damages and
other costs. They claimed that in 2001, they had sent Fox their manuscript which was based on
their own experiences of a prison break at a juvenile facility. In the 1960s, Donald Hughes
planned and successfully executed a prison escape for his brother, Robert Hughes, who was
wrongfully incarcerated. [57] [58]

[ edit ] Distribution





[ edit ] Television



Prison Break has been aired in other countries around the world including non-English
speaking countries. Canada has the same schedule as the United States via Global TV 's
simulcast . In the United Kingdom , the first two seasons of the show aired on Five , but Sky One
announced on June 5 , 2007 that it had bought the rights to Season 3, after Five had claimed that
the show's declining ratings meant that the asking price "was not value for money". [59] The
show was picked up by German TV channel RTL for its first season, and currently runs on
Thursdays, with two episodes at a time in Germany . In the Middle East, the show airs on every
Tuesday at 6:00 pm on MBC Action .

[ edit ] Online distribution



In addition to the television broadcast of the show, episodes of Prison Break has also been

well as its own extensive network. However, this was restricted to the United States only. The
first three episodes of season 2 were broadcast commercial free, available for a week after
their television broadcast date. [66] Online streaming of episodes was postponed after the
third episode. However, due to the show's three-week broadcast hiatus prompted by Fox's
broadcast of the Major League Baseball playoff games in October, a strategy was developed by
News Corporation (the parent company of Fox Broadcasting Company and MySpace ) in an attempt
to maintain their viewers' interest in the show. Starting from October, Fox began to stream
past episodes of the second season on the social networking site MySpace and websites of the
network's owned and operated stations (the stations are part of the Fox Television Stations
Group ). Although commercials are to be aired throughout the broadcast, the episodes are free
of charge. [67]

Other media

Derivative work of the show has been produced in the form of short videos for mobile phones.
There has also been several official tie-ins in print and on the internet.

A spinoff series, Prison Break: Proof of Innocence , was produced exclusively for mobile
phones and was broadcast first to Sprint customers in April, 2006 via on SprintTV's Fox
station. The first episode of Prison Break: Proof of Innocence became available on the
internet for viewing on May 8 , 2006 . This was an exclusive deal made between Toyota Motor and
News Corporation 's Fox network, allowing Toyota to sponsor exclusive content of the show and
to obtain advertising exclusivity.

In printed media, the show's tie-in products include an official magazine and a book written
in an in-universe perspective. The official magazine, published by Titan Publishing, was
launched on 21 November 2006 . Each issue contains interviews with selected cast and crew
members with other feature stories. The tie-in novel, Prison Break: The Classified FBI Files
( ISBN 1-4165-3845-3 ), contains details of the show's characters pertaining to the second
season's storyline. Written by Paul Ruditis, the book is published by Simon & Schuster and was
released on May 8 , 2007 . [68]

for everyone

Gillette is a business unit of Procter & Gamble . It is the successor of The Gillette Company ,
which was founded by King C. Gillette in 1901 as a safety razor manufacturer . It was based in
Boston, Massachusetts .

On October 1 , 2005 , The Gillette Company finalized its purchase by Procter & Gamble. As a
result of this merger, the Gillette Company no longer exists. Its last day of market trading -
symbol G on the New York Stock Exchange - was September 30, 2005. The merger created the world's
largest personal care and household products company.

Before the merger, Gillette had grown to become a leading global supplier of products under a
variety of brands . In addition to Gillette, the company marketed under Braun , Duracell and
Oral-B , among others.

In July 2007, Global Gillette will be dissolved and incorporated into Procter & Gamble's
other two main divisions, Procter & Gamble Beauty and Procter & Gamble Household Care.
Gillette's brands and products will be divided between the two accordingly.

The Gillette Super Speed razor became very popular among those who use the safety razor, and
many still consider it to be the best razor ever made. The Super Speed is known for its butterfly
doors on the top and a knob on the bottom that needs to be twisted to open the doors on the top.
Although it is hardly the only razor where the bottom knob is twisted to open, often referred to
as a Twist to Open (TTO) design (the Gillette Aristocrat also has a TTO design), it is the most
famous of all the TTO designed razors. Even to this day the Super Speed is considered to be
Gillette's claim to fame. Although it is no longer made the Super Speed is still available on
Ebay. A German company, Merkur, makes its own version.

Trac II : The Trac II was the world's first two-blade razor, debuting in 1971. Gillette
claimed that the second blade cut the number of strokes required in half compared to previous
razors, reducing facial irritation.

Trac II Plus is essentially the same as the original Trac II, with the exception of a
lubricating strip at the top of the blade. Trac II Plus blades work on the original Trac II
razor. The razors themselves can be difficult to find, but are still sold. Blades are far less
scarce, as Gillette normally sells all of its blades in most major shops.

Atra: The Atra was the first razor to feature a pivoting head, which enables the blades to "stay
on your beard longer for extra closeness". The pivoting made it easier for men to shave their
necks, and also was popular with women.

Atra Plus: The Atra Plus was the first razor to add a lubricating strip, dubbed Lubra-Soft
strip, softening hairs and acting as a sort of a low-tech aftershave.

Sensor : The Gillette Sensor was the first razor to have spring-loaded blades. Gillette
claims that the blades recede into the cartridge head if they hit flesh instead of cutting
skin, allowing them to move their blades closer to the surface of the cartridge, allowing a
closer shave.

Gillette Sensor 3: Same as the Sensor except is the first to have three blades rather than two.

Sensor for Women : Nearly identical to a Sensor in terms of technology, this razor has a much
wider head, reducing control but also reducing the chance of cutting oneself, which is a much
greater problem for women - who often cannot see what they are doing, shave larger areas of the
body, and often shave more delicate areas than men.

Sensor Excel : The Gillette Sensor Excel was the first razor to include MicroFins on the
cartridge head. MicroFins are essentially a piece of rubber with slits at the top, which in
theory stand up hair so that the blades can get a closer cut. They also are claimed to reduce
irritation when shaving against the grain. The grip on the handle was also redesigned. The
Excel was generally not seen as a major breakthrough compared to previous products.

Good News!: The Good News! was the first disposable double-blade razor. It was first released
in 1971. The Good News! comes in three forms: the original, the Good News! Plus, which includes
a lubricating strip, and the Good News! Pivot Plus, which features the lubricating strip, and
a pivoting head.

Sensor Excel for Women : The Sensor for women, but with MicroFins.

Mach3 : The first three-blade razor, introduced in 1998, which Gillette claims reduces
irritation and requires fewer strokes. It offers five improved microfins, improved spring
blades, and a pivoting head with greater bendability than previous Gillette products. It
introduced indicator technology to encourage users to change their blades more frequently:
the blue lubricating strip fades as the razor is used; when it is nearly white, it signals that
the blade needs changing. The Mach3 handle was also improved compared to the Sensor Excel.

Venus: Released later on, and based on the Mach3, but designed for women.

Mach3 Turbo: A Mach3 with ten microfins (as opposed to five on the original), improved
lubrication, improved 'anti-friction' blades, and a new grip. All Mach3 blades are
interchangeable between the three products in the range, so it is possible to use the Mach3
Turbo blades on a Mach3 razor.

Venus Divine: The Venus version of the Mach3 Turbo.

M3Power: A battery-powered version of the Mach3 Turbo razor (which can also be used with the
power switched off). The blades differ from Mach3 Turbo in having what Gillette says is a new
blade coating technology, which it describes as 'PowerGlide'. The lubrication and
microfins are identical to MACH3Turbo. In its desire to release ever more expensive
products, each claiming to be the 'best ever,' Gillette reached into hyperbole with an
injunction brought by rival Wilkinson Sword, and granted in the Connecticut District Court
determining that claims that 'M3Power raises hair up and away from the skin is both
"unsubstantiated and inaccurate."' and 'that the product demonstrations in Gillette's
advertising are "greatly exaggerated" and "literally false."' [1]

Mach 3 Power Nitro: Same as the Mach 3 Power with a slighly different handle design.

Venus Vibrance: The Venus M3Power. Venus blades are interchangeable across the line.

Gillette Fusion : In January 2006, Gillette released the "Fusion" in the USA, UK and Canada,
which has five blades, claiming 'the combination of adding more blades and narrowing the
inter-blade span creates a â€œShaving Surfaceâ€� that distributes the shaving
force across the blades, resulting in significantly less irritation and more comfort'. This
was despite previous responses to Wilkinson Sword four-blade Quattro product (which allows
the claim that Fusion the latest and greatest on the basis that if four blades is better than
three, five must be even better), that "We've tested multiple blades and razor elements for
decades," and "The simple addition of another blade does not itself improve a shave." [2] . It
also claims improved lubrication, although it does not state how it has been improved, and a
'Flexible Comfort Guard', which is a revised microfin configuration. It also has a blade on
the back for trimming upper lip hair or sideburns. (This move from three to five blades was
predicted by satirical newspaper The Onion in February 2004 [3] .)

Fusion Power: Released concurrently with the Fusion, the Fusion Power is a battery-powered
version of the Fusion razor. Its RRP is $12 for a razor pack, and $13-$14 for a pack of four Fusion
power blades; the razor is priced similarly to the M3Power, but the blades are slightly more
expensive as they are treated with Gillette's most advanced coating (Ultra Glide).

Fusion Power Phantom: Same as the Fusion Power with a black rather than orange color. Tags:
