several other top volleyball programs around the country.









"(Collins-Parker) is an excellent ambassador for the sport of volleyball as she is known for
her playing achievements while being very sincere and modest," said Sarah Bernson,
assistant volleyball coach at Cornell, in her nomination of Collins-Parker. "Even though
her playing days ended in 1992, Deitre is continually being recognized for her playing
ability and success."

Former Rainbow Wahine Deitre Collins-Parker Part Of 2008 AVCA Hall Of Fame Class







Rebuilding isnâ€™t a new concept to Collins-Parker , however.





Cornell's volleyball coach to enter Hall of Fame



From Ivyleaguesports.com :











â€œSPIKING INTO HISTORY





Deitre Collins is part of a few exclusive clubs â€” one as a former player on the NCAA's
25th Anniversary volleyball team as a player and another as a current coach who is a black
woman.â€�





From Coaching Management :



Q&A with Deitre Collins





Cornell University







As a middle blocker at the University of Hawaiâ€™i, Deitre Collins established a
reputation as one of the greatest athletes ever to play the game. Along with leading the
Rainbow Wahine to national championships in 1982 and â€™83, Collins was a three-time
AVCA All-American and the 1983 Honda Broderick Cup Winner as the National Athlete of the Year.
This fall, she was one of six players named to the NCAA Division I Womenâ€™s







Volleyball 25th Anniversary Team.







From the Star Bulletin.com :







Collins' hopes her Hawaii roots take hold at UNLV







The coin could have come up heads or tails. No matter what the outcome, Deitre Collins felt she
would have hit the jackpot. The former University of Hawaii All-American volleyball player
was pursuing a broadcasting career in Hawaii as well as looking to further her collegiate
coaching career. UNLV called first, offering Collins a chance to head the Lady Rebels program
that had been dormant since 1985.







From Cornell Big Red: The Wendy Schaenen '79 Head Coach of Women's Volleyball







Deitre Collins-Parker, a two-time national collegiate player of the year, was named the
eighth head volleyball coach at Cornell on June 1, 2004 by The Meakamw Smith Director of
Athletics and Physical Education Andy Noel. Collins-Parker is Cornell's second Wendy
Schaenen '79 Head Coach of Volleyball since the position was endowed in March 2002.







From the Georgia Dogs.com :







"Deitre and Dale (her husband) initially made a decision to come and join the Bulldog family
because it was in the best interest of their family welfare. A combination of Dale's family
planted in Georgia and his job opportunities extremely limited in Ithaca made joining our
program an ideal fit.







However, the situation is reversed now that Cornell has hired Dale as their assistant
basketball coach and Deitre's head coaching position remained open," said McCartney. "I
know this was an extremely difficult decision for Deitre and Dale, but in the end, they are
making a decision based upon what's best for their family. We all wish them the very best as they
begin this journey and I look forward to continuing a great friendship with both Deitre and
Dale."

The first-year Big Red volleyball coach talks about her experiences as a player and coach







What was your inspiration for getting into coaching?







You know, I never planned to coach. In the summers when I was playing overseas, I would come back
and work camps. My boyfriend, at the time, lived in Houston, so I would go work the University of
Houston camps in the summertime.







The coach there told me that whenever I retired, he would give me a job. But I was like, `I don't
want to coach. I hate doing camps.' I went on, and I played, and then I retired after the Olympics
in '92, in December. So after the Olympics, I went another six months. I looked for other jobs
and had some offers, and nothing was interesting to me. I think I just loved the sport so much
that I wanted any way I could still be involved, and he kept his word, and I went to the University
of Houston in January '93. I was only there eight months, but that is definitely the reason I got
into coaching, and now I can't imagine doing anything.







From Baden Sports.com: Women's Volleyball Coach Deitre Collins-Parker







Collins-Parker has plenty of international coaching experience as well. She served as head
coach of the 1998 U.S. junior national team, directing her squad to a gold medal in the national
qualifier. She served in the same capacity during the summer of 2000 (silver medal) and 2001
(bronze medal). In 1999, she was an assistant coach and was part of the selection committee to
find a coach for the national team for the World University Games. She began her international
coaching career as an assistant on the 1994 U.S. squad at the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg,
Russia, helping the team to a silver medal.

Deitre Collins has been named head volleyball coach at Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y.















A two-time national collegiate player of the year while competing for the Hawaii







Rainbow Wahine, Collins replaces Christie Roes.



From the Cornell Sun :



Coaching Couple Finds Happiness in Ithaca



The story really starts in 2004. After taking over the reins as head coach that summer,
Collins-Parker vaulted Cornell volleyball to unprecedented success immediately. A
two-time (1983-84) Broderick Award winner as collegiate player of the year and U.S. National
team member, Collins-Parker had already proven herself as a player and a coach before she came
to Ithaca, having become the winningest coach in UNLV volleyball history and having won
Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year in 1998.



But she was able to further her credentials on The Hill, turning a team that had been on the cusp
of greatness into a league powerhouse, winning three consecutive Ivy titles â€”
including its first since 1993 â€” and appearing in two straight NCAA tournaments by the
end of 2006.

After leading the volleyball team to three Ivy League titles in three seasons as head coach,
Deitre Collins-Parker has resigned from her position at Cornell to take a position as head

"They were not thrilled with the job I had done," Collins told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "I
was not thrilled with not accomplishing the goals that I set." She was the first volleyball
player to win the Broderick Cup, symbolic of the country's finest female collegiate athlete.
Collins went on to start for the 1988 Olympic team, then returned to UH to complete her degree.

with Cornell University.



She was head coach at UNLV from 1996-2004 and in 1998, Ms. Collins was selected Co-Coach of the

semifinal appearance. Ms. Collins has also served as the head coach for the U.S. Junior
National Team during three summers and an assistant coach for the U.S. National Team.

Deitre Collins, Head Coach, Cornell Womenâ€™s Volleyball



Deitre Collins, a two-time national collegiate player of the year, was named the eighth head
volleyball coach at Cornell on June 1, 2004 by Director of Athletics and Physical Education
Andy Noel. Collins is Cornell's second Wendy Schaenen '79 Head Coach of Volleyball since the
position was endowed in March 2002.







From the Daily Pennsylvanian:







Honey, about that job you just took down in Georgiaâ€Š



A coaching dilemma: One dream job preempts another for Cornell couple



Looking for the best volleyball experience she could find, Deitre Collins-Parker went from
Ithaca, N.Y. to Athens, Ga. and back again in a few short months - but don't call her indecisive.



After all, Collins-Parker had much more than her own coaching career to think about.



After leaving the head job at Cornell in January to take an assistant position at Georgia -
albeit a more prestigious one than manning an Ivy League program - she reversed course this
week, returning to the Big Red after her husband, Dale Parker, landed a paid job as an assistant
with the Cornell women's basketball program.

Deitre Collins-Parker: Team Captain and Leader

Team Captain and Leader: Deitre Collins-Parker



From the StarBulletin.com



Collins coming home



The former UH star brings her UNLV team to play No. 2 Hawaii



"If I had gone for the name recognition, I would have gone to UCLA or USC or Stanford," said
Collins. "Hawaii was not the easy choice. But Dave had graduated everybody and I was
guaranteed to play right way."







She made an impact from the beginning, helping Hawaii rebuild after the loss of eight seniors.
Hawaii was ranked No. 1 for most of her last three seasons. In her final match, a sweep of UCLA in
the 1983 NCAA final, she had 16 kills and eight blocks. Collins still ranks among the Top 10 in
seven UH career categories, including No. 2 in block solos (209).



"She was the most dominating player of her time," Shoji said. "Nobody played as fast as she did,
had as much offense as she did. She is one of the all-time greats to ever be in the program.



"She raised her level and developed as a player here, then went on to the Olympic team. We're
real proud that we had something to do with that. She made an impact on our program and an impact
nationally. She was the best player in the country for a couple of years."



From brandywinevbc.org Volleyball Terminology :











MIDDLE HITTER/BLOCKER (MH OR MB) - The position on a team who is primarily responsible for
blocking. Middle hitters or blockers are usually the tallest players on the team. Because of
their proximity to the setter, the middle hitter usually receives most of the quick and lower
height sets. Because of the variety of ability levels and heights, setting the middle is
considered one of the most difficult sets to make in all of volleyball.



However, setting the middle is indispensable to opening up the offense and keeping the
opposing defenders on their toes. In practice, middles get yelled at a lot because they tend to
get in the way of the setter. Some of the greatest middles in the history of the game include
Deitre Collins (Hawaii), Kim Oden (Stanford), Elaina Oden (Pacific), and Danielle Scott (
Long Beach State ).

From CSTV.com 10 Questions (and a Few Follow-ups) With Deitre Collins



The first-year Big Red volleyball coach talks about her experiences as a player and coach



You played in the Olympics, the Goodwill Games and the Pan Am Games, and you played
professionally in Europe for a few years. What is your favorite foreign city and why?



I lived in Paris for a while, and that was unbelievable. So, I guess Paris, but... I just like the
big places like Rome, Venice, I think Lausanne, Switzerland, is the most beautiful. Hong Kong
is great for shopping. Paris overall, though.



What was the best part of your Olympic experience?



I think in Seoul (South Korea, 1988), the Opening Ceremonies. The wait to go into the Opening
Ceremonies, when every country is out on this field. I think the realization that you are at the
Olympics. And then after that, walking onto the court for the first time. You play the same
countries over and over again, all the time, year after year, and you think it's going to be the
same. It's just another tournament. That's your mindset going in, and then, all of a sudden,
you're nervous because it's the Olympics, and I felt the reality of it all.



I can't describe it. It's just unbelievable. It's a dream come true. I get the chills every
year. Since my Mom got to go, it's funny because when the Olympics came on this year and the
Opening Ceremonies, she taped them. She called me and said, `You know, D, wherever the
Olympics are again (in the United States), I'll pay to go to the Opening Ceremonies. She just
thinks it's the coolest thing in the world, and that's from a spectators view. And then from an
athlete's view, it's unbelievable as well. It's a pretty neat thing.

Women's Volleyball Coach Deitre Collins-Parker



As a collegian, Collins-Parker was a two-time Broderick Award honoree as the national player
of the year (1983, 1984) after leading the Rainbow Wahine to consecutive national titles and a
110-5 record in her final three seasons. Collins capped off her career as the Broderick Cup
recipient as the nation's best collegiate athlete in all sports. She was twice named to the
NCAA all-tournament team and still holds the record for solo blocks in one NCAA tournament (15
in 1982). She was named as one of six players named to the NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball
25th Anniversary Team in October 2005.



From Hawaii Volleyball People



Collins' Teams to Be Honored in Hawai'i

All-America Te a m s and Aw a rd Wi n n e r s



From the Free Library :



TRAVELING THE UNPREDICTED PATH; VOLLEYBALL WAS DEITRE COLLINS' THIRD CHOICE; NOW IT'S HER
FIRST LOVE.



If the three-sport athlete at Antelope Valley High School in the late 1970s was ever to achieve
legendary status here, the Deitre Collins Story figured to write itself on the basketball
court or the track.



But volleyball?



``I just played volleyball because there was nothing else to do (in the fall). My mom (Arzella)
would always ask me why I was playing volleyball anyway,'' Collins said. ``There were very few
girls playing the sport back then.''



So when the AV High freshman found herself in front of a net at the gym for the first time in 1976,
little did she know that 21 years later, her resume would be impressive:



A member of the 1988 United States Olympic Team; two-time NCAA champion and winner of the

Former Rainbow Wahine Deitre Collins-Parker Part Of 2008 AVCA Hall Of Fame Class



From Ivyleaguesports.com : â€œSPIKING INTO HISTORY



Deitre Collins is part of a few exclusive clubs â€” one as a former player on the NCAA's
25th Anniversary volleyball team as a player and another as a current coach who is a black
woman.â€�



Despite little fanfare from the media, Deitre Collins has become one of the most celebrated
figures in the Ivy League. The head coach of the defending Ivy League champion Cornell
womenâ€™s volleyball team, Collins is one of three players to win the Honda Award, given
annually to the nationâ€™s best volleyball player, twice during her playing days
(1983-84). The other two-time winners are UCLAâ€™s Natalie Williams in 1991-92 and
Stanfordâ€™s Logan Tom in 2001-02.



But Collins holds another, less celebrated, distinction. She is one of the very few black
women coaching in Division I-A.



In January the Ivy League caught up with Collins to reminisce about her past successes, and to
discuss what the future holds for black, female coaches and the double standard that exists
between male and female coaches in collegiate athletics.



From cstv.com : 10 Questions (and a Few Follow-ups) With Deitre Collins The first-year Big Red
volleyball coach talks about her experiences as a player and coach



If you had to pick just one, what is the most memorable moment of your career as a player or a
coach?



You know what, that's easy for me. It was winning the Broderick Cup (given to the nation's best
collegiate female athlete in all sports). That meant more to me than...anything. I mean, the
Olympics are different. The Broderick Award was individual. I remember it plain as day, and I
think because, in that particular year that I won, Jackie Joyner was in it, Tracy Caulkins.



I remember at the ceremony, they were reading off all of these people's stats, and I'm going,
"Oh my gosh!" First of all, I can't believe I'm here, representing volleyball, and then,
Jackie was still in college, so she wasn't as well known as she became later, but we're just
like, "Tracy knows all the athletics directors by name, there's no way." Neither one of us
prepared a speech. Lo and behold, they call my name, and I'm just dumbfounded, and so I think
that was the highlight of my career as a volleyball player.



Jackie won it three years later. It's just been a lot of neat people that have won the Broderick
(among them Cheryl Miller, Jackie Joyner, Mia Hamm, Rebecca Lobo and Misty May), so it's just a
huge honor to me to be listed among those people. And then, the Opening Ceremonies at the
Olympics is right there. But I just separate those into two different classes. That's a great
experience (the Opening Ceremony) and that's the biggest honor (the Broderick Cup) for me.

All-American Deitre Collins have been named to the NCAA 25th Anniversary Women's Volleyball
Team, celebrating the 25th year of the NCAA Tournament in women's volleyball.



Shoji was voted as the coach of the team. He coached three NCAA championship teams, two runners
up, and three others that advanced to the semifinals.



Collins was a three-time AVCA All-American that won the Honda Broderick Cup as the National
Athlete of the Year in 1982-83. She was also the volleyball nominee in 1983-84. Collins was on
two national championship teams, named to two NCAA All-Tournament teams and still holds the
record for solo blocks in a single NCAA Tournament (15). Collins is currently the head coach at
Cornell.
