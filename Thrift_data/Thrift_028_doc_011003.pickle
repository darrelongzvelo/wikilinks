you from pollution!</strong>\n                    </em>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    If you are like me and live in a dense, urban environment, you are well aware of the problem posed by basic, ambient air pollution. The main source of this is from motorized vehicles using petroleum based fuel sources. While it may occasionally come from other sources like garbage incinerators or exploding meth labs, the vast majority is from cars.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    This is a huge problem for those of us who like to go running. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this activity is being outside. Trouble is, when you live in the middle of a place like New York City, it is impossible not to be detrimentally affected by air pollution. There is virtually no escape. While it is possible to go to a park and not be\n                    <em>as</em>\n                    exposed to air pollution, this can be a huge inconvenience for people who don\xe2\x80\x99t live near one. Even running through not-so heavily trafficked neighborhood can be harmful if a large truck or improperly tuned passenger cars goes by. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of using your lungs and all of the sudden you get a big chest full of burned, gaseous, petroleum by-products, it can be a real downer\xe2\x80\x93 a bad case of\n                    <em>respiratorius interruptus</em>\n                    is always demotivating.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Also, I hate the idea that I should be forced to go to a park to run in order to avoid\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 pollution. I am of a particular inclination when it comes to my running.\n                    <em>I am a street runner: I love running in the street</em>\n                    . After all, the streets are where the action is, and in a city like New York, there\xe2\x80\x99s no better place to be. Running there however, can be acutely detrimental to ones health. While running in polluted air is still better than not running at all, it is impossible to avoid its hazards. Well,\n                    <em>almost</em>\n                    .\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Imagine what it would be like running through the middle of mid-town Manhattan on a windless, humid day, when all that car exhaust gets trapped by the lack of circulation between buildings. Imagine running under such conditions while all of the sudden finding yourself caught behind a big truck or bus trying to accelerate because the light just turned green but you can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of the way of that big blast of hot soot and noxious fumes because of all the other vehicles that surround you. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the added drag of burning eyes (especially if you wear contact lenses), irritated throat and chest, coughing up nasty crap out of your lungs, blowing nasty crap out of your nose and of course that disgusting sheen of dirt and grime that accumulates on you face and all over you skin.\n                    <em>Let me tell you from personal experience that it sucks!</em>\n                    As fun and invigorating as it can be, the overall effects of running in the streets are are downright dangerous. But there is good news\xe2\x80\x93\n                    <em>it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be that way!</em>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Wearing a gas mask while running is the\n                    <em>perfect</em>\n                    solution. A gas mask filters out all the dust and poisonous gas in the air because that\xe2\x80\x99s\n                    <em>exactly</em>\n                    what it was designed to do. It will protect its wearer from inhaling most all of the toxic air pollutants found in any urban environment, but will also do so for ones eyes, nose throat and respiratory system. With this in mind, I would like to introduce the idea that\n                    <em>a \xe2\x80\x9cgas mask\xe2\x80\x9d</em>\n                    is not\n                    <em>just</em>\n                    a device to be used when spray painting indoors, playing with pesticides, making home-brew amphetamines, participating in a local riot against fascists or fending off a chemical weapon attack\xe2\x80\x93 but should generally be thought of as\n                    <em> wearing a helmet for your lungs.</em>\n                    In fact the gas mask\n                    <em> is </em>\n                    a\n                    <em>\n                      <strong>Lung Helmet\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2!</strong>\n                    </em>\n                  </p>\n                  <p style="text-align:center;">\n                    <strong>\n                      <em>A Lung Helmet\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 will do for your lungs what a helmet does for your head\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2!</em>\n                    </strong>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>Now you can wear a helmet for your lungs for the same reasons you would wear a helmet for your head\xe2\x80\x93 to help save you life while engaging in recreational sporting activities.</p>\n                  <p>\n                    True, a helmet for your head will protect from a specific, unexpected injury like when you fall off of a bike, but a\n                    <strong>\n                      <em>Lung Helmet\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2</em>\n                    </strong>\n                    will protect you from the\n                    <em> ambient </em>\n                    threat of air pollution. The dangers are immediate and real, but easy to ignore if you think you have no choice about it.

The real work to protect you is being done by the filters. The basic elements of a gas mask filter are activated charcoal and cotton.

These are standard fare with any commercially available civilian respirator. With military issue gas masks, things get a little more complicated with battlefield weapons involved, and more exotic elements have to be put into the filter.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve also found half-face respirators just don\xe2\x80\x99t fit on your the same as full-face models, which have more surface area to stick to and can distribute the pull of the headband better.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    As a military dork, of all the gas masks one could use, I prefer anything that is military issue. Not only are they usually cheaper (if you go surplus), but I also believe it is the duty of every citizen to comfortable using basic military gear, a gas mask most of all. The filters on military gas masks are intended to be NBC/CBRN rated (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical/Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear). Therefore, in addition to the basic charcoal/cotton combo, they also have other materials in there that are irrelevant to Gas Mask Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2. These other materials also expire, so if you are getting a gas mask and are concerned with domestic terrorism, you might want to check on that. For the purposes of GMR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2, any set of filters on a military surplus gas mask will do the trick, provided those filters are intact. If they are ruptured, definitely do not use them, as NBC/CBRN rated filters are made with potentially toxic ingredients\xe2\x80\x93 the kind you\xe2\x80\x99d be wearing a gas mask to avoid in the first place.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Another drawback to military issue gas masks for use as\n                    <strong>\n                      <em>Lung Helmets\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2</em>\n                    </strong>\n                    , is that new ones can be prohibitively expensive, while the inexpensive ones are unlikely to fit properly, even if they are new.

The moment you\xe2\x80\x99ve all been waiting for. I know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been wondering\xe2\x80\xa6. Just what is gas mask running? What is it for? What does it do? Why would anyone bother?

Now your have a quick answer for yourself and anyone who cares to ask why you are running around with a gas mask on. Now stand-by for the deets. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with strengthening your lungs. We will return to protects you from pollution and those other things in a following post.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Gas Mask Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 strengthens your lung with the action of Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2. Wearing a gas mask constrains your breathing. Much like breathing through a straw, it narrows the airways to your lungs. In addition, having to overcome the obstacle breathing through the filters provides additional resistance. The effect is that your lungs have to work harder in order to compensate for the added challenge.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>To clarify, in day-to-day activities, chances are your breathing is a passive activity, one to which little thought is given. In general, we breathe only as deeply as we need to at the moment, which if you are an average person in an un-challenging situation, is probably downright shallow.</p>\n                  <p>\n                    The depth and breadth of our breathing usually falls within a narrow spectrum. Observe your breathing at rest. Feel the difference between how full your lungs are before you exhale versus how empty they are when you inhale. Without resistance, our breathing has no reason to go beyond it\xe2\x80\x99s normal parameters. Stimulus like exercise, increases the depth of breathing, as well as heart rate and several other physiological changes.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    With activity comes the need for our metabolism to increase, which requires more oxygen in our blood, so our breathing intensifies. Unless we challenge our lungs appropriately, we will become \xe2\x80\x9cout of breath\xe2\x80\x9d after a short time. Our ability to harness the oxygen in the air, as well as expel carbon dioxide depends first and foremost on our lung capacity. This lung capacity is increased with conditioning, and increased exponentially when targeted through the Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 provided by the gas mask.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    In order to maintain stasis while wearing a gas mask and physically exerting yourself, a number of physiological changes takes place. The primary physiological change is that, you are forced to breathe deeply and in complete cycles. It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to breathing into a paper bag to prevent hyper-ventilation. Our bodies regulate how we breathe by the level of Carbon Dioxide, not the level of Oxygen in our blood. An increase in CO2 will bring our breathing back to a steady level. If you are wearing a gas mask while exerting yourself, you\xe2\x80\x99ll naturally take deeper, slower breaths.The feeling is natural, but harnessing this takes intent. This means breathing with an active, pumping action. To overcome Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2, you must forcefully push out with your breath as far as you can, contracting your diaphragm to it\xe2\x80\x99s utmost, and then inhale with just as much force deep into your lower lungs. If you only use shallow breaths in your upper respiratory system, you will very quickly pass out. The pushing and pulling action of Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 is like doing push-ups or pull-ups using your lungs. In this sense\xe2\x80\xa6\n                  </p>\n                  <p style="text-align:center;">\n                    <em>\n                      <strong>Gas Mask Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 does for your lungs what lifting weights does for your muscles!\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2</strong>\n                    </em>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The same way your muscles get stronger by resisting the effect of gravity against mass when weight-lifting, the Pulmonary Resistance Effect\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 provides resistance for your lungs, which strengthens them in turn. Only Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 as provided by act such as running while wearing the humble gas mask can target the lungs so effectively. No other exercise device or exercise alone can even come close.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The Pulmonary Resistance Effect\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 can also be described by metaphor. An old motor head buddy of mine once explained to me how a muscle car could be \xe2\x80\x9csuped-up\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s performance enhanced (forgive me if I get the terminology wrong). One way of doing this is by increasing the volume of the intake and exhaust manifolds. By installing wider ports or vents, more air than is normally possible can be made available for the engine to burn fuel better and get rid of the waste gasses more quickly. The end result is more efficiency. This is exactly what happens when you train with a gas mask. As your respiratory system grows more accustomed to the PR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 (Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2), the range and depth of your breathing is increased. The diaphragm, which is a muscle, is strengthened. Lung tissue is passive, but elastic and stretchy\xe2\x80\x93 increasing and decreasing in volume as we breathe. The Pulmonary Resistance Effect\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 challenges the elasticity making it more pliable. The little air-sacs in our lungs, the alveoli have a finite surface area to work with. PR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 and PRE\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 (Pulmonary Resistance Effect\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2) stretches the alveoli making them more elastic and increasing the surface area. This is not a \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x93 it is an acute sensation you will be able to feel without doubt after a very short time training with a gas mask. Whereas before the car was breathing through a straw, suddenly the straw is wider, making breathing easier. Running in a gas mask has the same effect\xe2\x80\x93 once you take it off. That\xe2\x80\x99s why GMR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 is such utterly outstanding cross-training. As you grow used to functioning in the gas mask, once it\xe2\x80\x99s removed, your cardio-pulmonary efficiency has increased significantly, which will give you more endurance and speed. I however, no longer have any interest in using the gas mask for cross-training, as I feel running without a gas mask is to have missed the opportunity to run\n                    <em>with</em>\n                    a gas mask,\n                    <em>I love it that much!</em>\n                    There\xe2\x80\x99s no going back for me.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Here is another metaphor I can use to explain it. Remember those\n                    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFUu-pn7Qtg" shape="rect">lung models</a>\n                    used in grade school to explain how respiration works? Two balloons in a closed jar with a piece of rubber on the bottom? And when you pulled on the rubber a vacuum was created and the balloons filled with air?\n                  </p>\n                  <div style="width: 236px" id="attachment_869" class="wp-caption alignright">\n                    <a href="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/lungmod.gif" shape="rect">\n                      <img alt="" src="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/lungmod.gif?w=614" title="lungmod" class="size-full wp-image-869"></img>\n                    </a>\n                    <p class="wp-caption-text">Lung Model (borrowed from hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu)</p>\n                  </div>\n                  <p>\n                    Well the Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 created by the gas mask would be strengthening that piece of rubber which is your diaphragm. This would make it tougher, more flexible and resilient. Working your diaphragm with the PR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 from a gas mask also utilizes your abdominal muscles in an amazing way, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll need more of them in order to function properly.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    As for the two balloons, well have you ever tried taking a fresh balloon out of the pack and just tried blowing it up right away? It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty hard, as the rubber has not been conditioned to be stretched. While it is possible to blow up such a balloon, it is recommended to stretch it out manually, enhancing it\xe2\x80\x99s latent elastic qualities. If the care is not taken to do this, not only is it harder to blow up the balloon, but the balloon suddenly bursting becomes much more likely. While already being made of an elastic material, the rubber has not been conditioned and is therefore not as flexible as it can be. Taking the time to stretch it out beforehand increases the efficiency of blowing up the balloon and reduces the likelihood of a premature burst. Your lungs work the same way.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>But wait, THERE\xe2\x80\x99S MORE!!!!</p>\n                  <p>\n                    Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 results in other physiological changes besides increased surface area in the alveolar sacs and a stronger diaphragm. With hindered breathing and slight deprivation of oxygen, our body reacts in particular ways. Akin to mild asphyxiation, our body attempts to increase the breathing rate and dilates the blood vessels. While this also happens with any increased level of physical exertion, performing that exertion while wearing a gas mask increases the effect. With the dilation of the blood vessels, particularly the capillaries, the body is working harder to deliver oxygen and dispose\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 of carbon dioxide. Again, this is like the car engine with greater input &amp; exhaust ports, or a larger carburetor.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Capillarial dilation is of particular importance to our health, because this is how Oxygen gets to all the little nooks and crannies of our cells, and the waste products of metabolism gets removed. Capillaries are the\n                    <em>fine-tuning</em>\n                    aspects of our circulatory systems. While I\xe2\x80\x99ve found conflicting evidence about whether red blood cell density increases or hemoglobin in those cells does, peoples that live in high altitudes develop extremely dense capillary networks compared to those who live closer to sea level. This may be a contributing factor that allows people who\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x9caltitude training\xe2\x80\x9d to do better when they return to lower altitudes. As you develop endurance and longevity in ability to run with a gas mask, there can be little doubt that something\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be going on with your Oxygen delivery system. If you are looking for a way to keep fresh and \xe2\x80\x9cyounger\xe2\x80\x9d looking, having a dense network of pumped, primed, elastic capillaries is going to play a strong role.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    When Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 is brought to it\xe2\x80\x99s more intense levels, it\n                    <em>commandeers</em>\n                    <em>not just the respiratory system but the entire circulatory system</em>\n                    in order to meet its needs. As blood flow increases, blood vessels too, become more elastic and stronger. Keep in mind we don\xe2\x80\x99t just pump blood with our hearts\xe2\x80\x93 our entire circulatory system gets in on the act. These physiological events are noticeable immediately, but to really exploit their benefit regular use with a gas mask for prolonged periods is necessary. It is absolutely, positively possible to run while wearing a gas mask for extended periods of time. I know\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve done so. The longest I have was 8 hours and 18 minutes while running my first &amp; so far only ultra-marathon. It kicked my ass, but doing it in the gas mask was the easy part. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve trained your body to function for long periods of time in the gas mask, it physiological benefits go from immediate to long term, as adjustments are maintained and sustainable. If you thought your blood pressure was going to drop because of regular exercise, imagine how much more so it would become with the enhanced Pulmonary Resistance Effect\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 on you circulatory system after several hours of GMR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2!\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Another way I like to think about the benefits of Gas Mask Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 are by comparing it to the pulmonary disease, emphysema. Almost all cases of\n                    <a href="http://www.unc.edu/courses/2004spring/engl/012/070/56593/" title="emphysema" shape="rect">emphysema</a>\n                    is acquired and caused by prolonged exposure to air pollution. There is no greater form of exposure to air pollution than smoking tobacco. As bad as it may be to inhale second-hand smoke and other air pollutants like car exhaust, nothing comes close to the damage tobacco does when inhaled directly into the lungs over a prolonged period.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    This is of particular relevance to me as I\n                    <em>loathe</em>\n                    tobacco, not just as a substance, but everything about its culture and history. One day in the not-so-distant future I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you my three cents about it. For now, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0\n                  </p>\n                  <p style="text-align:center;">\n                    <em>\n                      <strong>Gas Mask Running is the exact opposite of smoking tobacco/emphysema.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2</strong>\n                    </em>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Tobacco smoking is the voluntary (sort of) ingestion of carcinogenic crap in exchange for making the White Man even more filthy rich at your expense. Tobacco smoke contains an ever-varying assortment of horrific chemicals that are absorbed by your blood, in addition to all the toxic sludge it contains that will get lodged into your lungs when inhaled. All that crap inhibits the ability of our lungs to do its job, namely\n                    <em>to fuckin\xe2\x80\x99 breathe.</em>\n                    Even if you take away the cancer-causing effects, the tar clogs your lungs like sludge build-up in a car engine. Eventually, just as your pistons will cease, so will your lungs. Specifically, the alveoli will loose their elasticity, as will the diaphragm and bronchi.\n                  </p>\n                  <div style="width: 310px" id="attachment_872" class="wp-caption alignleft">\n                    <a href="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/empic1.jpg" shape="rect">\n                      <img height="256" width="300" alt="" src="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/empic1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=256" title="empic1" class="size-medium wp-image-872"></img>\n                    </a>\n                    <p class="wp-caption-text">The Emphysatic Alveoli (borrowed from www.unc.edu).

As if simply displacing the oxygen weren\xe2\x80\x99t bad enough, these chemicals also cause the blood vessels\xe2\x80\x93 especially the capillaries\xe2\x80\x93 to constrict, so our circulatory system is placed in jeopardy while it is also depriving our cells and tissue of even more oxygen and nutrients. Exercise and nutrition may help alleviate these effects, but smoking tobacco is ultimately a waste of our physiological resources. When combined with improper nutrition and lack of exercise, the negative effects of smoking are compounded, and the loss of alveolar elasticity is exacerbated. The Pulmonary Resistance Effect\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 of Gas Mask Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 takes all these factors and sends them to their opposite extreme. While exercise alone can do this in part, Gas Mask Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 takes it to a whole other level.

ever conceived, I started to do some research out there on the interwebs about gas mask running, jogging and training. If you read my post about \xe2\x80\x9cOther Gas Mask Runners on the Interwebs\xe2\x80\x9d you already know a little bit about it. That was mostly about other gas mask runners. I also found a class of inquiry on interweb message boards as well, mostly people asking about gas mask running in one form or another. There seems to be this undercurrent of thought that suspects running in a gas mask will simulate the effects of high-altitude running. Along those lines, I found this question on the website\n                    <a href="http://www.best-running-tips.com/gas-mask-running-to-simulate-high-altitude.html" shape="rect">Best-Running-Tips</a>\n                    (http://www.best-running-tips.com/gas-mask-running-to-simulate-high-altitude.html).\n                  </p>\n                  <p style="text-align:center;">\n                    <em>Gas Mask Running to Simulate High Altitude</em>\n                  </p>\n                  <p style="text-align:center;">\n                    <em>by Jason</em>\n                    <em> (Louisville, KY)</em>\n                  </p>\n                  <p style="text-align:center;">\n                    <em>\n                      I have recently been training for my first triathlon and I have began to use a gas mask when I run and bike. Are there any health risks to doing this and have you heard of this before. I figured it would simulate high altitude training with less oxygen, or maybe I am just an idiot who loves torture.

While I would also very much recommend his site for all your running needs, he gave a safe, but incorrect answer based only on a lack of experience with gas mask running, suggesting it was actually \xe2\x80\x9c\n                    <em>detrimental to your running training</em>\n                    .\xe2\x80\x9d He made some further comments that\n                    <em>were</em>\n                    valuable such as \xe2\x80\x9c\n                    <em>high altitude training is not a guarantee to optimal results</em>\n                    \xe2\x80\x9c. How very true! Then there was an opportunity for readers to add comments. There were of a variety of opinions ranging from those who had used gas masks with enthusiasm, had mixed results or those who thought it not helpful at all. This was my first opportunity to leave a big steamy pile of Swineflu juju amongst the interwebs running community. After introducing myself and telling my story up to that point, and added some stuff about protection from air pollution, I got down to the brass tacks.\n                  </p>\n                  <p style="text-align:center;">\n                    \xe2\x80\x9c\n                    <em>\n                      Anyway, the GM won\xe2\x80\x99t simulate a high altitude, but it most certainly will give your lungs a work out that will blow your mind!\n                      <strong>By creating pulmonary resistance, your diaphragm is strengthened, surface area and elasticity in the alveoli is increased</strong>\n                      . With the addition of the other gear, cardio resistance is also increased.

The term \xe2\x80\x9cpulmonary resistance\xe2\x80\x9d had\n                    <em>never</em>\n                    been used in any literature before. I know\xe2\x80\x93 I researched it quite extensively. Even patent applications for gas masks and mechanical breathing devices failed to use this phrase. If anything, the term \xe2\x80\x9cbreathing resistance\xe2\x80\x9d pops up. The description of the effect of \xe2\x80\x9cpulmonary resistance\xe2\x80\x9d, namely strengthening the diaphragm, as well as surface area and elasticity increase of the alveoli (the lung\xe2\x80\x99s air sacs) was novel too. A proper description of the effects of training in a gas mask for physical fitness purposes had likely\n                    <em>never</em>\n                    been made and had certainly not made it to the interwebs. So what, you ask? Well, in January of 2010 while googling more \xe2\x80\x98fo-fo on gas mask jamming I stumbled across\n                    <a href="http://www.executiveresults.com.au" shape="rect">Executive Results</a>\n                    (http://www.executiveresults.com.au), a gym and personal training center in Brisbane, Australia.

While this was certainly true a few years ago, while keeping tabs on the Goddamned Crackers\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 who honked\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 my shit more recently, I did indeed stumble across a whole new world referring to \xe2\x80\x9cpulmonary resistance\xe2\x80\x9d. While I still stand behind my statement that I was outright plagiarized by \xe2\x80\x9cExecutive Results\xe2\x80\x9d in Australia and the \xe2\x80\x9cSean Sherk Elevation Training Mask\xe2\x80\x9d here in the US of A, I must concede that while still rare in literature, \xe2\x80\x9cpulmonary resistance\xe2\x80\x9d is not quite an entirely unheard of term. It has always been limited to the medical field, most often in regards to Anaestesiology, and usually combined with other words to make such terms as \xe2\x80\x9cpulmonary vascular resistance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpulmonary arteriolar resistance\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cPulmonary resistance\xe2\x80\x9d had never been used (at least according to the interwebebs) in regards to gas masks\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 or any kind of exercise related to them. Until that is, I coined the term specifically for use with Gas Mask Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 on \xe2\x80\x9cBest-Running-Tips\xe2\x80\x9d two years ago, without any knowledge of outside sources. And of course, even if it could be construed that PR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 is not so unique, both \xe2\x80\x9cExecutive Results\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSean Sherk Elevation Training Mask\xe2\x80\x9d still blatantly stole my copy\xe2\x80\x93 those cheap, unimaginative, plagiaristic Goddamned Crackers\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 !\n                  </p>\n

Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 in earnest, gas mask running seems to have made a slow, but undeniable start at taking off as a popular activity. Well, maybe\n                    <em>popular</em>\n                    is the wrong word, as GMR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2(1) is still perhaps the most obscure sport one could think of\xe2\x80\x93 that is if it could even be considered a \xe2\x80\x9csport\xe2\x80\x9d in it\xe2\x80\x99s own right. In researching the development of gas mask running in cyberspace (and\n                    <em>perhaps</em>\n                    to stroke my own ego a little bit), I was hoping there\xe2\x80\x99d be a stray pic or two of yours\n                    <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SwinefluAvenger" shape="rect">Swineflu</a>\n                    truly, training on\n                    <a href="http://www.coneyisland.com/" shape="rect">Coney Island</a>\n                    in 2001 when I got started and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t blown my back out yet. No such luck. Around October 2009 when I was gearing up to run the\n                    <a href="http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/" shape="rect">New York City Marathon</a>\n                    in full-Swineflu regalia (\n                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M17_gas_mask" shape="rect">M-17</a>\n                    gas mask,\n                    <a href="http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_body_armor_pasgt.php" shape="rect">PASGT flak jacket</a>\n                    ,\n                    <a href="http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_kevlar_helmet.php" shape="rect">PASGT helmet</a>\n                    &amp;\n                    <a href="http://www.bodybar.com/" shape="rect">10 lb baton</a>\n                    , I finally sat down and did a little research on the interwebs to see what else was\n                    <em>out there</em>\n                    . Until this time, I had mistakenly thought that I,\n                    <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SwinefluAvenger" shape="rect">Swineflu Avenger</a>\n                    , was the only person around with the absolutely fucking\n                    <em>genius</em>\n                    idea of running with a gas mask on. While in my delusions of grandeur I would like to think I may well be the first to make it a dedicated, populist idea, I was certainly not\n                    <em>thee</em>\n                    first to make the attempt.\n                  </p>\n                  <div style="width: 122px" id="attachment_369" class="wp-caption alignright">\n                    <a href="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/insanejogger3.jpg" shape="rect">\n                      <img height="150" width="112" alt="" src="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/insanejogger3.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150" title="InsaneJogger" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-369"></img>\n                    </a>\n                    <p class="wp-caption-text">\xe2\x80\x9cInsane jogger\xe2\x80\x9d indeed!</p>\n                  </div>\n                  <p>\n                    The earliest mention of someone running around in a gas mask I could find was a photo on the Flickr page of \xe2\x80\x9c\n                    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/propboy/" shape="rect">propboy</a>\n                    \xe2\x80\x9d called \xe2\x80\x9c\n                    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/propboy/19382465/" shape="rect">Insane Jogger</a>\n                    \xe2\x80\x9c.

I saw this guy a few hours ago jogging down Lafayette at Astor Place. Keep in mind that it\xe2\x80\x99s 95 degrees in NYC today. He was wearing a black hoodie, red boxing gloves, and a GAS MASK. I scrambled from my camera phone and this is all I came up with. But I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, he was wearing a full face gas mask!\xe2\x80\x9d\n                  </p>\n                  <p>Seems like a boxer guy enhancing his work-out buzz with a quick jog about the \xe2\x80\x98hood, and daring to be a little different.

They were not only wearing gas masks, but \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93boots-n-utes\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and/or NBC suits with hoods &amp; gloves. Finishing together as they had presumably started, and wearing the Avon S-10 model gas mask.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    It must be noted however, that upon close inspection of the pics, it appears that even though they are wearing gas masks, they are not doing so with the filter canisters attached. I feel this still qualifies them for a great step forward in the world of Gas Mask Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 although not a complete one. While running in a gas mask without the filter will provide\n                    <em>some</em>\n                    Pulmonary Resistance\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2, it would only provide a fraction of what it would with the filter. Still, considering they are wearing boots, gloves, hoods, field dress utilities or perhaps even full MOPP suits, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not about to make light of their effort. This would also indicate that Gas Mask Running\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 in it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s own right was not necessarily their intent, but were instead engaging in what could only be described as a thoroughly ass-kicking, high-motivational run in some heavy-duty military gear. Still, so far as GMR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2 goes, this makes their run a kind of \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Bent Pyramid\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd, if you know what I mean\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c almost there, but not quite.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Their time was 2 hrs &amp; 22 min and 30 sec\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c a commendable feat even in the best of circumstances and motivating as all hell! Undoubtedly, this team of Canadian soldiers (I also presume they are French Canadian, judging by their names) have earned a nickname. For lack of a better one, let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s call them \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Les Trois Aigles!\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd To the best of my knowledge, they did not apply to Guinness World Records for this event, but certainly should have. It looks like they may indeed have been thee first people ever to run an official half-marathon in gas masks. As such, their time of 2:22:30 sets the benchmark for Half-Marathon GMRs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2(2) everywhere! I have not been able to find any other leads on these pioneers of GMR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xc2\xa2(1), so if anyone out there in Swineflu land knows them, please high-five them for me.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    A little further research on Flickr led me to a few more pix.

Although a paragon of physical fitness, he seemed more like a body-builder than a runner. Research indicated he was in his early 30s, as tall as me (6\xe2\x80\x992\xe2\x80\xb3) and weighing in at a whopping 235 lbs. of lean, solid muscle. Each of his shoulders\n                    <em>alone</em>\n                    was the size of my head, and that meant his time was probably on the slow side.

Winter was coming up so marathon season was moving to warmer climes. While there was a nerve-wracking chance that he would run a less popular marathon before then, I was willing to bet he was gearing up for the 2010\n                    <a href="http://www.marinemarathon.com/" shape="rect">Marine Corps Marathon</a>\n                    in Washington D.C. the following year.

            In a post 9-11 world, running around\n                    <em>anywhere</em>\n                    in public while wearing a gas mask may not sound like too hot an idea. For reasons that are not as obvious as one may think, the gas mask carries a social stigma- one of fear. While this is understandable, being that the perception of a gas mask is the\n                    <em> threat </em>\n                    of \xe2\x80\x9cgas\xe2\x80\x9d, it is also a shame because the gas mask is waaaaay more than that\xe2\x80\x93 or at least, it\n                    <em>can</em>\n                    be.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    When gas mask running here in my home town of New York, I have had to confront not only the potential prejudice of others and the understandable concern of lawful authorities, but also my own fears of having possibly transgressed an unspoken barrier of social contract. For a long time, I was worried that at any given moment I might, despite quite innocent motivations, suddenly become the focus of acute fear and that people might actually perceive me as a threat. Whatever it might look like, I am indeed sensitive to the mores and taboos of the society in which I live and do not necessarily have a problem with them\n                    <em>most of the time</em>\n                    . Believe it or not, I\n                    <em>hate</em>\n                    to think my activities may lead me to be a pariah. Thankfully, after nearly three years of consistent gas mask jogging in the very heart of 9-11 land, this has not happened.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    I\xe2\x80\x99m quite lucky. New York City has a long tradition of giving a wide berth to the unexpected and unusual. New Yorkers will put up with a lot of shit, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily\n                    <em>take shit</em>\n                    . I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that if I were to loose my bearing while gas mask jogging in their town, New Yorkers would be all over me like stink on a gorilla, and I would be praying for the police to rescue me from their clutches. Yet with very few exceptions, I have been allowed to make my way all over NYC without hindrance. This is in no small part to the efforts I have put in to \xe2\x80\x9cdemilitarizing\xe2\x80\x9d my appearance as much as possible.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Originally my concept for the Gas Mask Jogger/Swineflu Avenger included the military-based look. While this may be hard to avoid, given that I am wearing a military issue\n                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M17_gas_mask" shape="rect">gas mask</a>\n                    ,\n                    <a href="http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_body_armor_pasgt.php" shape="rect">flak jacket</a>\n                    ,\n                    <a href="http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_kevlar_helmet.php" shape="rect">helmet</a>\n                    &amp; carrying a\n                    <a href="http://www.bodybar.com/" shape="rect">10 lb baton/simulated rifle</a>\n                    , I found that I felt more comfortable, and also felt that\n                    <em>others</em>\n                    would feel more comfortable if I were to look less militant. Besides, \xe2\x80\x9cmilitant\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly my style, although\n                    <em>I am</em>\n                    a proponent of using the military mindset, skills and knowledge for purposes of self- and civic-empowerment. So, I wear a blaze orange safety vest with reflective strips over the flak jacket, had a custom made matching helmet cover for the Kevlar brain bucket, reflective orange gloves, and have covered my baton in blaze orange gaffers tape. Previously, high visibility material was an accoutrement to the gear, while now it has become a central feature.\n                  </p>\n                  <div style="width: 182px" class="wp-caption alignright">\n                    <a href="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/04-nwh10-a-sm6.jpg" shape="rect">\n                      <img alt="" src="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/04-nwh10-a-sm6.jpg?w=614" title="04-NwH\'10-a-sm" class="size-full wp-image-744"></img>\n                    </a>\n                    <p class="wp-caption-text">Typical Swineflu in full gear.</p>\n                  </div>\n                  <p>\n                    The blaze orange covering has advantages. Firstly, it makes me not only visible, but\n                    <em>glaringly</em>\n                    visible. I am a safety nut\xe2\x80\x93 maybe not all the time, but certainly when it comes to Swineflu Avenging. Wearing a gas mask places one in a state of sensory deprivation. There is a loss of peripheral vision, a feeling of claustrophobia to the uninitiated and the distraction of having a near two pound slab of silicone strapped to you face. The rest of the gear doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help the situation. Appearing as a shiny, twinkling orange blob to motor vehicles, bikes &amp; pedestrians is in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s best interest. It prevents casualties which must be avoided at all costs, which leads me to the first two rules of Swineflu Avenging\xe2\x80\xa6\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <strong>\n                      Rule #2\xe2\x80\x93 injuring oneself is\n                      <em>almost</em>\n                      the worst thing that can possibly happen while gas mask running.\n                    </strong>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <strong>\n                      Rule #1\xe2\x80\x93 becoming responsible for\n                      <em>someone else\xe2\x80\x99s</em>\n                      injury is absolutely\n                      <em>thee</em>\n                      worst thing that can possibly happen while gas mask running.\n                    </strong>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    My primary purpose, as a gas mask runner, in\n                    <em>to train</em>\n                    . If I am broke, I can\xe2\x80\x99t train. My secondary purpose, although it follows on the heels of the primary one, is to promote the gas mask as the most awesomest exercise device the world has seen in the modern age\xe2\x80\x93 and I intend to be it\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador. If\n                    <em>anything</em>\n                    bad happens to me or someone else while I am wearing a gas mask in public, I have not only fucked things up for me, I have done so for the gas mask. This might also deprive many people the exhilarating, empowering experience of training is a gas mask, and I would certainly not want to do\n                    <em>that</em>\n                    .\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Secondly, the blaze orange gear (I hope) allays any fears that I may be up to no good. Yes, I may be someone in a gas mask, but provided I continue to otherwise behave respectfully, the orange safety gear should contribute to the gas mask being overlooked as a potential threat. I become visible enough to enter ones field of vision even at it\xe2\x80\x99s most peripheral. As such, there is a part of our brains that is always tracking vision and movement. A bright orange blob will be spotted and tracked by our brains long before we would ever become consciously aware of it. Theoretically at least, if you were to be suddenly surprised by the fact that there was someone across the street running by in a gas mask, you would have already been subconsciously aware of the presence of an orange spot having entered your field of vision and moving slowly past long beforehand. Therefore, you might not find the situation so startling.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The blaze orange covering also provides me with an even surface upon which to affix identifying name tapes as well as carefully chosen propaganda material, namely in support of the\n                    <a href="http://drugpolicy.org/homepage.cfm" shape="rect">Drug Policy Alliance</a>\n                    (NO MORE DRUG WAR!) and\n                    <a href="http://www.subvoyant.com" shape="rect">Subvoyant Post-Production</a>\n                    , my home away from home. It positively affirms my identity as a Swineflu Avenger and gas mask runner-in-training, who wishes to avoid any mishap or misunderstanding and pass peacefully through the world. It also puts me out in the open in such a way that there can be no dispute that I am\n                    <em>not</em>\n                    trying to sneak around. I have nothing to hide and what you see is what you get.\n                  </p>\n                  <div style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft">\n                    <a href="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/babysm3.jpg" shape="rect">\n                      <img alt="" src="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/babysm3.jpg?w=614" title="BabySM" class="size-full wp-image-740"></img>\n                    </a>\n                    <p class="wp-caption-text">If you see Swineflu-- say Swineflu!</p>\n                  </div>\n                  <p>\n                    Still, people may not always be thinking the way I would like them to and I must leave room for things to go wrong with their perceptions. After all there\n                    <em>is</em>\n                    a \xe2\x80\x9cWar On Terror\xe2\x80\x9d, and while I personally feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s purpose has less to do with protecting\n                    <em>us</em>\n                    from \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists\xe2\x80\x9d and more to do with\n                    <em>us</em>\n                    terrorizing\n                    <em>ourselves</em>\n                    , I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame anyone for thinking the worst.\n                    <em>\n                      <strong>As far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cWar On Terror\xe2\x80\x9d has turned most Americans into a bunch of sniveling pussies who\xe2\x80\x99ll shit their panties the moment the world fails to conform to their expectations.</strong>\n                    </em>\n                    Like it or not, running around New York in a gas mask may play a part in that which I do not intend. Basically, 9-11 really fucked things up for gas mask running.\n                    <em>Too bad</em>\n                    .\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Lastly, by being shrouded in blaze orange reflective gear, Swineflu Avenger is offering a courtesy to lawful authority and security concerns by providing a clear and easy target. I have never,\n                    <em>ever</em>\n                    been so cocky as to think that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly walking on eggshells with the general public and law enforcement. I have run in full Swineflu mode through such places as Wall Street, Times Square, routinely run over the Brooklyn Bridge and up Center Street in Manhattan, past all manner of government buildings. I may be deliberately pushing boundaries (however gently?), but I do so always assuming that I am in the cross-hairs of a police sniper\xe2\x80\x99s rifle, and am being very carefully tracked as I pass by. Let there be no doubts that I offer myself humbly to all those who might need to take me out, as the easiest damned target they ever had.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    If you\xe2\x80\x99re\n                    <em>not</em>\n                    scoping me out down a rifle barrel, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to know that acquiring a good sight picture on a Swineflu Avenger should be no problem for even the most jittery of pistol wielders. All you gotta do is put the little \xe2\x80\x9csnow man\xe2\x80\x9d (1) on the \xe2\x80\x9cbig orange blob\xe2\x80\x9d and gently pull the trigger. My flak jacket is the old PASGT model and was designed to protect the wearer from low-velocity, oddly-shaped projectiles. If you throw a rock or beer bottle at me, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance it won\xe2\x80\x99t penetrate. And while there is\n                    <em>some</em>\n                    conjectural evidence on the interwebs that the PASGT vest can stop the smallest of rounds, there is no doubt in my mind that anything 9mm and above is gonna go straight through it\xe2\x80\x93 and into me.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    To drive it home, the orange reflective gloves allow my hands to be seen at all times. This is not just convenient for using hand signals in traffic, but also lets anyone know where my hand are in relation to my body, avoiding potential accidents. If/whenever I get stopped by police, my hand movements are readily observed.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    My baton\n                    <em>is</em>\n                    a \xe2\x80\x9csimulated rifle\xe2\x80\x9d for the purposes of Swineflu-type training, but covered in blaze orange tape allows its outline to be clearly seen and leaves less room for surprises. Most people seem to think it is a wiffle bat of some sort. I have to know for us both that it is indeed a ten pound steel rod, 39.5 inches long. While encased in foam rubber, it\n                    <em>does</em>\n                    have the potential of injury, which as has been stated, is my goal to avoid at all costs. Fyi, I have\n                    <em>never</em>\n                    dropped the baton while in the process of Swineflu Avenging.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    So this leaves us with my one big beef concerning the issue of the gas mask and possible public perception of it as a threat. I\xe2\x80\x99m one of those crazy people who sincerely believes that if you are doing nothing wrong, then\n                    <em>you are doing nothing wrong</em>\n                    . This includes activities that others may not appreciate, understand or even be outright hostile to. I\n                    <em>hate</em>\n                    having the feeling that I am doing something wrong when I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not, and will do everything I can to prove otherwise.\n                  </p>\n                  <p style="text-align:center;">\n                    <strong>\n                      <em>There is nothing wrong with wearing a gas mask in public.</em>\n                    </strong>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Of course there is common sense involved and one must be prepared to answer questions to the curious and concerned. The only caveat so far as I have ever been able to figure out is that one is not allowed to hide ones face with the intent, or while in the process, of committing a felony, as\n                    <em>this</em>\n                    would be\n                    <em>wrong\xe2\x80\x93</em>\n                    in case anyone was getting it confused with the statement above.\n                  </p>\n                  <div style="width: 116px" class="wp-caption alignright">\n                    <a href="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/smedleybutler-sm2.jpg" shape="rect">\n                      <img alt="" src="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/smedleybutler-sm2.jpg?w=614" title="SmedleyButler-sm" class="size-full wp-image-712"></img>\n                    </a>\n                    <p class="wp-caption-text">Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler-- one of the greatest Punk Rockers of all time, and the patron saint of Swineflu Avenging!</p>\n                  </div>\n                  <p>\n                    While I must admit that\n                    <em>twice</em>\n                    I have heard from police officers that it is \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the law to cover your face in public\xe2\x80\x9d (once in passing, the other time more definitively\xe2\x80\x93 but in good spirits), I can only assume this is with felonious activity in mind. After all, if this were true,\n                    <em>all</em>\n                    forms of face covering\n                    <em>at all times</em>\n                    would be illegal, and this would be downright nutty. If it is cold and someone is wearing a ski-mask, is it illegal? What if it is not cold but they just feel like it? Granted, wearing a full-face Halloween mask in Springtime would be weird, but if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t\n                    <em>actually</em>\n                    doing anything wrong, what difference does it make? What of people wearing religious garb? If an area is open to the public, should someone in a burqa be any less threatening than an orange-clad jogger in a gas mask?\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Well, maybe. I guess my point is that it is all a matter of context and public perception. There has been little or no precedence until now for a gas mask to represent anything other than \xe2\x80\x9cgas\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csomeone deliberately concealing their identity for the purpose of committing a felony\xe2\x80\x9d. I would of course like to see this changed. I also argue that the gas mask actually offers little in way a threat.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    If one decided to use the gas mask simply to conceal their identity as part of a criminal activity, then they have made a poor choice. Unless that person was one of those multitasking types was out to exercise their lungs while holding up a liquor store, they would find their breathing inhibited to a detrimental degree\xe2\x80\x93 even if the mask was performing adequately. Depending on the type of mask they were using, they might find themselves passing out. With certain models, if the filters aren\xe2\x80\x99t fitted right or the valves are faulty, the wearer could be re-breathing their own carbon dioxide. Better to just get a paper bag and poke a couple of holes in it.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Unless you\n                    <em>know</em>\n                    what you are getting into, chances are your gas mask is at best obsolete. Surplus masks are unreliable for anything except as costume. Just because a gas mask has a \xe2\x80\x9cfilter\xe2\x80\x9d on it, that does not mean it is effective for anything related to Nuclear/Biological/Chemical protection. If you do some research and are lucky, you may be able to get something that would be effective for general air pollution, but that would be all. If the mask isn\xe2\x80\x99t fitted properly, not only will you be uncomfortable, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll be compromising its ability to protect you. Most likely, the average mask wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even work for tear gas. I hope to get into more detail about this later.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Ask yourself, when was the last time you ever saw a \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist\xe2\x80\x9d? Was that \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist\xe2\x80\x9d wearing a gas mask? Did the fact that s/he was wearing a gas mask have any bearing on the type of antisocial act they were committing? In other words, was any kind of \xe2\x80\x9cgas\xe2\x80\x9d used as an active part of that event?\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Despite the 9-11 and Oklahoma City \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist\xe2\x80\x9d attacks, neither had anything to do with threatening gas or the use of gas masks in any way. In Europe, where actual terrorist attacks have been way more commonplace over the past sixty years than in the United States and prepared for at every turn, I can\xe2\x80\x99t find any evidence that either gas or gas masks have played any role.

If in contact with police who are not otherwise confronting me, I always offer to remove my mask as a courtesy. There have been plenty of times when a police officer was just making a curious inquiry as to my motivations, provoking a friendly discussion, rather than an actual confrontation. When passing any police officers, vehicles or posts, I always give a salute and greeting. More often than not, I have the salute returned.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    To be sure, in Fall of 2009 I sent letters of intent, describing the Swineflu Avenger project, along with pictures and copies of positive identification to Mayor Bloomberg, NYPD Commissioner Kerry and at least five NYPD Precinct commanders around New York, including the Central Park Precinct, where I do most of my training these days\xe2\x80\x93 and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 I never heard back from them. Let me be on the record that as Swineflu Avenger, I have done everything I can to be completely transparent about my intentions and candid about my activities. I hold myself solely responsible for my actions and all consequences stemming from them. I have always made myself available to inquiries from anyone who asked and despite my appearance, have done everything I can to mind my own business and make the smallest impression possible. Furthermore, I attest that I have never made the life of lawful authority any harder than it already needs to be.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Unfortunately, there are communities that may not have such a wide berth for the unusual as New York City. Such places may absolutely object to anyone wearing a gas mask for any reason other than an officer or soldier in the line of duty.\n                    <strong>\n                      There are those people and authorities that may believe that because one is doing something different, that this gives\n                      <em>them</em>\n                      the right to be an asshole.\n                    </strong>\n                    I would love to hear the stories of any brave soul who wished to jog around Washington D.C. in a gas mask for some reason. Still, if you are doing nothing wrong, you are doing nothing wrong. If a free, private, common American citizen or legal resident wishes to do a little gas mask training s/he should by all means oblige. There may be a few hairy eyeballs or the occasional un-empathetic police officer to answer to, but why should that stop you? \xe2\x80\x9cCourtesy, Professionalism and Respect\xe2\x80\x9d, the motto of the NYPD, also goes a long way for\n                    <em>anyone</em>\n                    doing something unorthodox in the public sphere.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    I feel strongly that ones mental and physical health are the next American Revolution. If you are patriotic in any way, either to this country or some other, to humanity or Life in general, then it is in\n                    <em>your</em>\n                    interest to live as long and as healthy a life as possible. This makes us available to be of service to our fellow living creatures and helps make the world a better place. Gas mask training is probably the greatest step one can take in this direction after exercise itself. There is\n                    <em>nothing</em>\n                    that one can do without wearing a gas mask that wearing a gas mask won\xe2\x80\x99t make better. Not even sex.

I am an aspiring amateur athlete, physical fitness enthusiast and pseudo-performance artist; born, raised and currently living in New York City. It is my wish to promote the simple, common gas mask as the most awesomest physical fitness tool since hominids were first chased up trees by saber-toothed tigers.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    I have been continuously running in the streets of New York City with a gas mask since Fall of 2008. I had initially started in the Summer of 2001, but overzealous training using the \xe2\x80\x9cno pain, no gain\xe2\x80\x9d philosophy led me to severe injury from which it would take years to recover. That however, is another story.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    My personal fitness goal is to be able to run marathon distances (26.2 miles or more) wearing a gas mask, flak jacket, Kevlar helmet while carrying a ten pound baton\xe2\x80\x93 and maybe set a record or two along the way. I am progressing toward completing my goal, but the closer I get, the farther away it seems. You know, like that weird camera effect in scary movies when someone realizes something and it gets all, like, weird and stuff.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>The closest I\xe2\x80\x99ve come so far to achieving this was on Sunday October 10th, 2010, when I ran the \xe2\x80\x9cStaten Island Half-Marathon\xe2\x80\x9d with all the gear in the morning, and ran almost the same distance in Central Park later that day.</p>\n                  <p>Shy of my big goal, some other notable runs I\xe2\x80\x99ve done thus far are\xe2\x80\xa6</p>\n                  <p>\n                    <a href="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/bkhm10-hs.jpg" shape="rect">\n                      <img height="150" width="99" alt="" src="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/bkhm10-hs.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150" title="BkHM\'10-HS" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-681"></img>\n                    </a>\n                    Saturday May 22, 2010, I completed the \xe2\x80\x9cBrooklyn Half-Marathon\xe2\x80\x9d in NYC while wearing a gas mask, flak jacket, Kevlar helmet and carrying a ten pound baton. It took me 2 hours, 36 minutes and 59 seconds. It earned me my first Guinness World Record, although only for \xe2\x80\x9cFastest Half-Marathon in a Gas Mask\xe2\x80\x9d. The other equipment did not play a factor in setting the record.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <a href="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/sfmar10-hs.jpg" shape="rect">\n                      <img height="150" width="99" alt="" src="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/sfmar10-hs.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150" title="SFMar\'10-HS" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-682"></img>\n                    </a>\n                    Sunday July 25th, 2010, San Francisco, CA. I completed the \xe2\x80\x9cSan Francisco Marathon\xe2\x80\x9d in the gas mask alone, without too much problem. It took me 5 hours, 4 minutes and 6 seconds. It earned me my second Guinness World Record. To my knowledge I was the first person to ever receive a world record for running a full marathon in a gas mask.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <a href="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/mm10-hs2.jpg" shape="rect">\n                      <img height="150" width="100" alt="" src="http://swinefluavenger.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/mm10-hs2.jpg?w=100&amp;h=150" title="MM\'10-HS2" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-683"></img>\n                    </a>\n                    Sunday September 26th, 2010, New York, NY.

I completed the 18 mile course in 3 hours, 26 minutes and 41 seconds. This gave me my fifth record with Record Setters the record-keeping group formerly known as URDB.</p>\n                  <p>\n                    Whatever it may look like, I am\n                    <em>not</em>\n                    a highly trained, nor particularly skilled athlete. The times I\xe2\x80\x99ve set in my records are at best remarkably average, even though I was wearing a gas mask. I like having\n                    <em>established</em>\n                    these records, making most of them accessible to more average runners like myself to be able to beat. I take great pride in being a total hack \xe2\x80\x94 a DIY amateur, albeit a motivated one. I LOVE running around in a gas mask, but I have no special talent for running. I\xe2\x80\x99m barely disciplined enough make it to the end of the day. I only ever put in the absolute bare minimum amount of training needed to get the job done \xe2\x80\x94 and no more. In fact, I am the laziest person I know.
