The TV show Cheaters and why it would be illegal in the UK



There is often a question asked when Cheaters comes on the television in the UK. The first is,
“Why don’t they have a UK version of cheaters? That would be awesome.” It would. I agree.

I asked a State-side friend on Twitter how the show was received in the states and the response
is “not very well”. She said that its appeal in the UK might be down to it involving
American’s acting like morons . In its most basic sense it is. Because Americans act
stupidly in such situations we find it comical and entertaining. In this country they would
take the news better, with tact, dignity and discretion and be more calculating than to run
into a restaurant screaming “Pay my bills! Make it rain!”.

The main reason why Cheaters wouldn’t happen in the UK are two-fold. It is for societal
reasons and, more importantly, for legal reasons.

Societal Reasons



So we had the chat show in the form of Trisha and later Jeremy Kyle . They were evidently
rip-off’s of their American counterparts. When these sorts of shows came on, the
conjecture was very much that things in this country don’t fly where they would in America.

One example of this would be a Polygraph or “lie-detector” test. In America their results
are admissible as evidence in court. They are seen as infallible. In this country we know they
are not. The police don’t use them, the courts don’t use them and our justice system is
globally respected. When they wheel one out on a show like Jeremy Kyle, you know the results are
going to ruin the relationship either way so why watch.

In the show Cheaters, they also hire private detectives. In this country one would not usually
go to the lengths of hiring a detective. You either trust your partner or you don’t. If you
trust your partner, stay with them, if you don’t break it off, thus hiring a private
investigator to spy on your nearest and dearest would be frowned upon. Cheaters would seem
like a fairly extreme length to go to.

Leveson and Privacy

Ever since one of Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers hired a private investigator to hack the
telephone of a murdered schoolgirl , the media’s attitude to privacy has been scrutinised.

If we think that as a society we are presently redefining the media landscape and chastising
Murdoch for spying on individuals. If we were then to give Carte Blanche to an entertainment
program to be more intrusive that would simply not wash.

CTB and Article 8

Who remembers Ryan Giggs super injunction ? That was granted because a media organisation
presented an affront to his “ private and family life “. Subsequently the papers could not
name him. Human Rights Laws pretty much over-ride everything. Not only does spying on someone
breach their human rights, but also in the resulting legal case would cost millions in
damages. That’s if the episode got shown in the first instance.

The subject of the show obviously knows that they’re going to be on it during the
confrontation. There is nothing to stop them from going to a judge, getting a super injunction
(because despite what the media tell you, it’s not just for the rich and famous) and stopping
the show from ever being shown.

In Summary

Sure the American’s have a show where people get stupid, and bad people get their
comeuppance, but what they lack is important safeguards in society. Sure it’s nice to watch
things like that, but as much as I like watching Cheaters, I value the safeguards in our legal
system that would stop a show like that in the UK from ever being made far more.
