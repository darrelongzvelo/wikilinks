The Really Big Questions

by Evan Moulson November 30, 2011

Update: Visualization  of how far human radio signals have reached in the galaxy.  (Keep in
mind that humans have been producing radio waves for only about 200 years and intentionally
pointing dishes into space to tell extraterrestrials we exist for maybe 100 years.)

Pop science shows often make the mistake of telling us exactly how lucky it is that the
universe, or the galaxy, or the Earth, or humans, actually exist at all.  “With just a
slight change in X, the world would be a very different place” could be a quote lifted from
almost any NOVA hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson , Robert Krulwich , or Brian Greene . 
Unfortunately, that often leads to the question and summary answer, “Why did the universe
work out the way it did, so that life exists and we exist?  Obviously because [insert deity
here] made it that way.”

No.  No, that is not the reason.  You are the weakest link, goodbye .

I’m not going to debate the existence of your deity, but I will, in the spirit of
Thanksgiving, make you feel...

 

â€œHeaven Just Got a Lot Smarterâ€�

On the evening of October 5th, 2011, Apple Inc. released a statement notifying the world of the
passing of co-founder, Chairman and former CEO Steven P. Jobs.

Gone But Never Forgotten

 

 

I read that news on an iPhone. I texted my dad, who also found out via his iPhone.  I walked into
the Tilton second floor common room as the story broke, and of five laptops I saw, three were
Macbooks being used to look up the news. As I was walking through campus to the Cousens Gym,
everyone I passed had phones out and was reading the story. More than half of those phones had
the Apple logo on the back. It’s almost poetic, that the last news story Steve Jobs would
ever directly cause would be read at the peak of his company’s powers, the height of its
pervasiveness and staggering success.

My dad is an avid Jobs fan and an Apple devotee. Like hundreds of millions of others, he is drawn
to the brilliant innovation...

 

Evolution

I’m setting the mood for this one by putting the music up here. Let it play as you read through.

This is war. Under the lights, at night, everything fades except the burn in my legs, the
floodlights illuminating the surface before me, and the unique mix of cocky patience that
comes from knowing I have what it takes but understanding that I can wait as long as I need to.

I hunch over slightly, panting, feeling beads of sweat slowly advance through my hair before I
spring back in the direction I came. A few drops work their way down along my cheeks, clinging to
my stubbly chin before bravely dropping into the abyss. I ignore the drops flying as I
straighten again, my eyes tracking the sphere spinning away from me.  With no conscious
instruction, my left foot digs into the cement and twists right, powering me off the ground and
towards it as my right hand begins the back-swing. Without any decision to...

 

Voices of the Fallen

College, first and foremost, is an opportunity to broaden your horizons. To manage to link
what you learn in class to what you do outside is exciting in high school, certainly, but in
college it’s effortless and infinitely more profound.

One of the classes I’m taking this first semester, and probably the most routinely
fascinating one, is Western Political Thought I. For that class, the reading assigned over
the previous weekend was excerpts of the Greek historian Thucydides’s account of the
Peloponnesian War (an ancient conflict between the Athenian Empire and Sparta’s
Peloponnesian League). The tale is fascinating, but that’s not the part relevant to this
post. The relevant part  is the funeral oration given by Pericles, a renowned Greek
statesman that Thucydides refers to as the ‘first citizen’ and de facto ruler of Athens.

Pericles, having encouraged Athens to declare war on Sparta, now stands above the bodies of
the first Athenian men...

 

With You Right Here Iâ€™m a Rocketeer, letâ€™s Flyyyyyyy

Here we are. The start of a journey. I’ve been slowly, hesitantly working toward taking the
helm of this particular craft for eighteen and a half years.

My name’s Joe Singh, anointed a Jumbo less than two weeks ago.

If you’d like, you can join me as I set out to discover who I am when I start from scratch. With
any luck, it’ll be who I was all along.

One thing you should know: I’ll either start or end most of my posts with a song that is
relevant to what I’m discussing. Sometimes it’ll be for the lulz, sometimes it’ll just
be beautiful.

So, with that, let’s fly.
