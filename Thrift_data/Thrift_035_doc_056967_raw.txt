He gave up GBV for lent

Play it: Just a few requests for tonight's show





Image: http://static.flickr.com/52/105588773_9f08a6966f_m.jpg So tonight is Fat
Tuesday, and tomorrow's the beginning of Lent. Well... tonight I celebrate by seeing Robert
Pollard sing close to 50 songs with a great backing band (guitarist Tommy Keene and Superchunk
drummer Jon Wurster, among others.) Since Uncle Bob has another album already in the can
awaiting release later this year, and he's got a double-album he's touring in support of, I
suspect they'll take up the bulk of the show, but I'll still find myself yelling out a few tunes
that I hope he'll play tonight.



* "Do Something Real" (Not in Rhapsody)

* "Subspace Biographies"

* "I'm A Widow"

* "Maggie Turns To Flies"

* "I Expect A Kill" (Not in Rhapsody)

* "Conquerer Of The Moon"

* "Get Under It"

* "Kick Me And Cancel"

If the USA doesn't bomb you

Play it: Morrissey " I Will See You in Far Off Places"

Stream the single "You Have Killed Me" at Myspace

Download: "You Have Killed Me" ( scoops the podcast ) If your God bestows protection upon you

And the U.S.A. doesn't bomb you

I believe I will see you someplace safe

- "I Will See You in Far Off Places" - Morrissey

Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/5/7/9/3/783975_170x170.jpg [The titles
on these tracks are wrong (should be reversed,) for those who play it in Rhapsody.]



Recently, Morrissey claims to have been investigated by both the FBI and UK Intelligence
(Special Branch,) concerning his threat to both governments. "They were trying to determine
if I was a threat to the government, and similarly in England," the 46-year-old singer told
NME. "But it didn't take them very long to realize that I'm not."



By the looks of the first track (from the forthcoming Ringleader Of The Tormentors ) leaked
earlier, "I Will See You in Far Off Places," Moz probably bought himself a ticket for
(unwanted/warranted) cavity searches. In it, his lyrics align himself with the Muslim world
- following the lyrics profiled above, religious chants are layered into the song, just in
case we didn't get the idea.)



As most know, I'm as anti-Bush as they come, and am forever critical of US foreign policy, but
these lyrics and the song itself feel very naive and misplaced. At it's heart, I imagine, is
less a real belief then an intention to say 'bugger off' to America, and rile some folks up. In
that I think he might be successful, although I wonder if the label (Sanctuary) is hesitant, as
they've been militant about stopping the leak of the track , and the lead single title has
switched to "You Have Killed Me," which is much lighter fare even considering the metaphoric
title.

How's my hair?

Play it: Rhett Miller The Believer It was less a matter of me putting myself into someone's
hands and more a matter of me using this system, where I had written these songs, but I was now
also interpreting them, like I was Bing Crosby or something.

- Rhett Miller on recording the album

Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/1/9/6/2/782691_170x170.jpg The story
goes, producer George Drakoulias ( The Jayhawks , Black Crowes , Tom Petty ) saw Old 97's
frontman Rhett Miller performing his songs solo/acoustic, and he was busting strings, and
generally acting frustrated. Drakoulias sees this and decides on the spot that for this
album, he should be Frank Sinatra . Lose the guitar, forget that you wrote the songs, and
instead just sing and interpret them, backed by a top-notch studio session band.





Image: http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/7/6/3/4/9404367.jpg Forget for a second
that the band included friend (and producer of previous album, The Instigator ) Jon Brion , the
end result sounds like session musicians, quite unlike the 'warts-and-all' appeal of the Old
97s. Other helping hands include Rachel Yamagota (duet on "Fireflies") and Gary Louris
(singing backup througout.) His previous album saw Brion holding back on his magic (until the
beautiful closer, "Terrible Vision,") whereas this album feels more spit-n-polished then
anything he's done. Don't get me wrong, there are some great songs here ("Brand New Way," the
Brion/Aimee Mann penned "I Believe She's Lying") it's a bit too MOR of the Adult-Alternative
genre.



Miller is now L.A.-based, and his latest photos relect that change. He's ready for his
close-up (literally... he's already got the Old 97's appearing in the forthcoming Jennifer
Aniston/Vince Vaughn comedy The Break-Up.) Check out that hair! This album has a bit of that
hair goop sheen to it, and I'm hoping he washes it out and sleeps on it for the next Old 97's
release.

What Kurt Cobain couldn't do

Play it: Os Mutantes Tecnicolor





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/osmutantes.jpg For one night
only, the Brazilian band Os Mutantes will reunite to perform at Barbicon Art Gallery/Hall in
London (May 22nd ,) as part of Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture , a festival
celebrating the Brazilian art movement Tropicalia , that arose in the late 1960s and
encompassed theatre, poetry and music. Os Mutantes , along with Caetano Velaso , Gilberto Gil
, Gal Costa and Tom ZÃ© , were all heavies in the movement and will all be performing. The
lineup for the show includes brothers Sergio and Arnaldo Baptista along with drummer Dinho,
but no Rita Lee, unfortunately. Kurt Cobain tried to get them to reunite in '93 for Nirvana 's
South American tour, but was flatly turned down. A later compilation released by David Byrne
's Luaka Bop ( Everything is Possible , 1999) drummed up even more interest w/ them reuniting,
and have since been name-dropped by Beck (see song "Tropicalia" on Mutations ) Mac McCaughan
(Superchunk, Merge Records, and Portastatic - see his cover of "Baby" on the De Mel, De Melao
EP)





Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/3/1/4/3/773413_170x170.jpg This past
week saw the reissue of the Os Mutantes album Tecnicolor , which was originally released in
1970. It's a collection of their best work reworked in the English language, hoping to crack
the American and European market. Some of the tracks lose a lot of their appeal w/o the beauty of
the Portuguese language, but for the most part, they all still stand on their own. The
hilarious "El Justicero" (sung in Spanish) and psych-Beatles songs "Tecnicolor" and
"Virginia" would later appear on Jardim Eletrico (1971.) The Luaka Bop compilation is still
the best place to start with their catalogue, but for long-time fans it's nice to finally have
something else digitally available.

Farewell Leilani Lanes

Play it: A Karaoke farewell to Leilani Lanes





Image: http://static.flickr.com/39/104956217_3d6fa57e1a_m.jpg As many of you know,
Drake Lelane is actually my nickname, but many aren't aware of it's origin. Years ago (what is
it...seven now?) I chose the name 'Drake' as my karaoke (stage) name (at the Lani Kai Lounge,
Leilani Lanes ) in honor of "The Drake" from a classic Seinfeld episode ( "The Labelmaker," )
and also in reference to Spoon frontman Britt Daniels' solo name, Drake Tungsten . The last
name (used only for bowling at the time,) was homage to the place the alias was born: Leilani
Lanes. The moniker became my nickname following a spirited performance of "The Safety Dance"
(at the aforementioned Lani Kai Lounge.) The (I assumed drunken) crowd started a "Drake"
chant, and the rest is history.



Well, speaking of history, these beloved Leilani Lanes are soon to be history, following the
sale to a developer who plans to level it and put in an apartment/retail structure. After 44
years (and famous Earl Anthony / Dick Weber bowling face-offs) Leilani is closing it's doors
forever, and like any relationship, you have to make sure to say goodbye to them (before they
say goodbye to you.) So Saturday night (babysitters in tow,) a bunch of us did our best to send
Leilani Lanes off.





Image: http://static.flickr.com/34/104946604_7e93646f0b_m.jpg The drink of the night
was the Pink Pussycat (gin, grapefruit juice, and a little extra 'meow') so I just had to start
the evening off with a couple of them and the Tom Jones / Burt Bacharach classic "What's New
Pussycat." There were only three notebooks (w/ song choices) available to peruse and the
choices were much more limited then in the past, so it wasn't nearly as good as we remember it
being - like where was my new fave "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)" ?
and old standby "Rock the Casbah" ? I ended up singing the former w/o the aid of Karaoke (and w/
the aid of much alcohol.)



Anyway, much fun was had - that is until morning, when Eli's 5AM wake-up call was very
unsympathetic to the condition my condition was in .



"What's New Pussycat" - Tom Jones

"Burning Down the House" - Talking Heads

"Don't Go Breaking My Heart" - Elton John w/ Kiki Dee (duet w/ my Tootie)

"Brandy" - Looking Glass

"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)" - Kenny Rogers & the First Edition

Winter games walks on the wild side

Play it: Lou Reed rocks the Winter Olympics





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/loureed_olyrings.jpg We
started it off with a little Carla Bruni flag-handling , so why not end the games with the
cult-icon Lou Reed .



Friday night, Reed performed at the Olympic medals ceremony , keeping his usual low profile.
There was concern that he wouldn't make it, after he cancelled several NY shows leading up to
the performance, but in the end, his show exceeded all expectations. Besides his first-rate
backing band ( Rob Wasserman , Tony Thunder Smith , Fernando Saunders , Mike Rathke) he also
included his Tai Chi master, a discipline from which Reed now finds inspiration, even writing
music to accompany the moves.

The man who loved music

Play it: Essential Scott McCaughey The only reason I'm still playing music is because I get
along with people...I know for sure that I wouldn't be in R.E.M. except for the fact that I'm a
fun person to hang out with and have a drink with. That's my biggest qualification over my
musicianly skills.

- Scott McCaughey

Image: http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/4/7/9/5/9385974.jpg Rhapsody just added
three Young Fresh Fellows albums... couple that with the recent release of The Minus 5 's s/t
release and you suddenly have a plethora of releases from McCaughey to choose from. The YFF and
Minus 5 frontman has been a Seattle music scene fixture since the early 80's, both as popular
musican/singer and as columnist for local music rag, The Rocket . After connecting later with
Peter Buck , McCaughey not only had him playing in his side project, The Minus 5, but also
booking shows for his wife's rock club, The Crocodile.





Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/3/3/2/4/524233_170x170.jpg The Young
Fresh Fellows were everyone's favorite party band, often getting compared to The
Replacements . Paul Westerberg was a fan and even had them play at his wedding. Westerberg,
NRBQ and They Might Be Giants all were name-dropping them, and while it was flattering, it did
little for album sales. Their album The Men Who Loved Music ( Play it ) was a top-to-bottom
masterpiece of fun rock. It almost even garnered them a hit (college radio airplay, anyway)
with "Amy Grant" ( Play it ) which famously confessed "when she comes home from church/she's
gotta take off those pants/that's what I like about Amy Grant." Co-founding member Chuck
Carroll left shortly after, needing to feed his family, and was replaced by Fastback
guitarist/songwriter Kurt Bloch . It took a couple albums for them to gell as a band (as they did
with Electric Bird Digest ,) but by then, a lot of momentum was lost, and grunge had taken over
the city.





Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/1/4/0/0/560041_170x170.jpg Meanwhile,
McCaughey had already recorded a solo album ( My Chartreuse Opinion , 1989) and had enjoyed the
collaborative feel of the process. In 1992, R.E.M. mixed Automatic for the People in Seattle,
and Peter Buck met his wife Stephanie, co-owner of the Crocodile Cafe. Buck became a
Seattlite, and when your a musician in Seattle, you get to know McCaughey. By '94 McCaughey had
already recruited him for a new collaborative project he called The Minus 5. They released the
Old Liquidator , which featured Buck, The Posies , and members of NRBQ . McCaughey soon found
himself as a touring member of REM, but continued to be dedicated to releasing a Minus 5 album
with regularity. In 2000, McCaughey hooked up with Wilco (after meeting at a Lounge Axe
benefit) to record the Minus 5 album, Down With Wilco ( Play it ,) which promptly got mired in
similar major label difficulty like Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , which was making the
rounds at the time. McCaughey songwriting has become more and more meloncholy over the years,
and remains knee-deep in 60's pop.



The Young Fresh Fellows also continue to get together and perform to the delight of rapid fans
here (and in Japan.)

Kite gets Smoosh ed

Play it: Head Like a Kite Random Portraits of the Home Movie

Download: "Noisy at the Circus" (feat. Asya from Smoosh) ( Pattern 25 )





Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/9/9/3/2/782399_170x170.jpg I was
checking out the band Head Like a Kite today, not knowing anything about them other then having
heard the name somewhere before, when the nifty song "Noisy at the Circus" came up, and heard
the distinct voice of 13-year old Asya from the sister band Smoosh . Turns out Head Like a Kite is
Dave Einmo, guitarist for local band Sushirobo .





Image: http://www.pattern25.com/graphics/hlak/IMG_7938.jpg Recorded by Brian Deck (
Iron & Wine , Modest Mouse , Red Red Meat ) in Chicago, Random Portraits samples from Einmo's old
Super 8 home movies and wires his keyboards into a collection of old, analog guitar effects for
a disjointed, yet organic original sound. Some of it comes across as Kraftwerk -like
experimental journeys ("Tell Mommy You Want a Sip of Beer,") while elsewhere it's more
straight ahead indie guitar power pop ("Noisy at the Circus.")





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/smoosh.jpg For those not
initiated into the phenomenon of Smoosh, they're a Seattle-based sister duo, ages 11 and 13,
who play endearingly happy (and sloppy) indie rock. Jason McGerr (now drummer for Death Cab
for Cutie,) was 8-year old Chloe's teacher and suggested she play with other musicians to get
an idea of how percussion works in rock, so she went home and nabbed her 10-year old sister
keyboardist/singer-songwriter sister Asya and Smoosh was born. They're wonderful 2004
debut She Like Electric (on Pattern 25 records, like Head like a Kite,) is in Rhapsody and worth
your listen (below.) They've finished recording their new album (as of 01/10/06,) showing
amazing balance between middle school and indie rock.

Novel Sndtrck: Glass Soup

Play it: Novel Sndtrck: Glass Soup





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/glasssoup.jpg Jonathan
Carroll's Glass Soup is a sequel (of sorts) to his novel White Apples (which I Novel Sndtrck'd
last month .) Whereas White Apples dealt with the living realm, Glass Soup spends much of it's
time in the land of the dead. The realm of the dead is built from the dreams - and nightmares - of
the living. Octopuses drive buses. God is a polar bear. And a crowded highway literally leads
to hell (where AC/DC 's "Highway to Hell" blasts from all passing cars.) Main characters
Vincent and Isabelle are back, as well as chaos' form and of course the concept of life as a
mosaic (glass soup.)



Not as much music this time around, especially considering Rhapsody's AC/DC hole ("Highway
to Hell" is prominent.) But not a song is wasted here.



* "Eggs And Sausage (In A Cadillac With Susan Michelson)" - Tom Waits (referencing the album
Nighthawks at the Diner )

* "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head" - B.J. Thomas ( Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid )

A gorge-ous lineup

Play it: Sasquatch Music Festival 2006





Image: http://myspace-483.vo.llnwd.net/00504/38/46/504396483_l.jpg The lineup for
this year's Sasquatch Music Festival has been announced , and like last year , it kicks some
serious ass. Unlike last year, they've made this Memorial Day weekend festival stretch out
over three days ( last year was a Saturday-only event .)



I'm not excited about Friday's lineup ( Nine Inch Nails ) but Saturday and Sunday promise
serious listening pleasures. Saturday features The Flaming Lips , The Shins , Neko Case , Iron
& Wine , Sufjan Stevens , Rogue Wave , Sam Roberts , Constantines and Architecture In Helsinki ;
while Sunday features Beck , Death Cab For Cutie , Queens of the Stone Age , The Decemberists ,
Nada Surf , Clap Your Hands Say Yeah , Arctic Monkeys , Chad Vangaalen , Rocky Votolato and Laura
Veirs .





Image: http://static.flickr.com/13/16526438_ac75f93471_m.jpg If you have the chance,
it's an absolutely gorgeous backdrop ( The Gorge Ampitheatre , WA,) to hear great music like
this. And if you do go... I may recruit you to give your report on it, as I'm going to be at my
nephew's Bar Mitzvah in Minneapolis.

I'm just a victim of bad timing.

As the wealthy American underground wept

Play it: Destroyer Destroyer's Rubies





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/destroyersrubies.jpg Two of
the best albums of the year were dropped on us today, Two Gallants What the Toll Tells (not
Rhapavailable) and the much anticipated Destroyer's Rubies from Dan Bejar's Destroyer .
Taking the sentiments and pop structures of Streethawk ; and the instrumentation and
looseness of This Night ; (and borrowing phrases and more from every previous Destroyer
album;) Destroyer's Rubies is like a mosaic of all of Dan Bejar's best work as Destroyer.
Lyrically, the Vancouver, B.C. native has always been a giant, but seemed (at times) barely
able to keep up with himself, whereas now his usual poetic couplets are tossed off with such
swagger and confidence, it's hard not to fall in-step behind his every stacatto'd syllable.



I have this theory that when The New Pornographers formed and Bejar made his power pop
contributions, his own Destroyer project moved further away from pop as a result, whether
consious or not. I'd argue now that the Pornographers, with Twin Cinema , have themselves
moved a little away from their poppier beginnings, Bejar's able to go back to
pre-Pornographer ways, ala Streethawk and the like. Not that a person has only a finite amount
of pop they can write in a year, or anything, but it's only natural to keep them differentiated,
dontcha think?



Regardless of where Bejar's head was at in the authoring, it's an amazing album. But don't take
my word for it:



The Onion A/V club gives it a score of 100

Dusted gives it a 90

Pitchfork explains why they didn't give it a 10.0

Two days short tomorrow

Play it: Two Gallants The Throes





Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/6/2/3/5/775326_170x170.jpg Tomorrow
sees the second release from the S.F. duo , Two Gallants ( What the Toll Tells ) but since it's on
Saddle Creek Records , I hold little hope for it being Rhapavailable (although, I have secured
my copy.)



Don't get your head down, though Rhapsodoggies, as their fine 2004 debut snuck in recently,
and it's far too heady and gut-wrenching to have been made by two 20 year-olds, but alas, these
prodigies done did it. The Throes kicks like The Pogues funneled through The Grapes of Wrath ,
but still rockin' West Coast... and all just good old guitar and drums.



It's little wonder the Steinbeck lyrical nature is making a comeback, as during the 30's, the
working class was ravaged by floods, drought , massive layoffs and mismanagement by our
government, which sounds kind of familiar now. Something to think about as this President's
Day winds down .

Maybe partying will help

Play it: Minutemen "Maybe Partying Will Help"





Image: http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/5/2/0/2/9352025.jpg How best to bring
everyone together after a major tragedy like Hurricane Katrina? Throw a big ass party like
Mardi Gras.



New Orleans is back... alcohol, masks, beads, alcohol, bared-breasts, more beads and more
alcohol. Can't blame 'em... it's in the air.



Know why I'm partying? The Minutemen are in Rhapsody! Apparently they snuck in while I was on
vacation ( late January? ) Thankfully, J Shifty noticed last night , otherwise I'd still be in
the dark. Best I can tell, SST is making baby steps into being Rhapavailable. So far it's only
the Minutemen, Black Flag , and the Descendents . We're missing the other big guns, though,
with Husker Du (and don't forget Soundgarden and Screaming Trees released some great albums
on SST.) A couple other great SST bands already had their SST albums sold off... Meat Puppets
(to Rykodisc) and Dinosaur Jr. (to Merge Records,) so we're pretty close to having a decent
size SST sampler. Other SST artists I'm looking forward to are Bad Brains , ALL , Leaving Trains
and fIREHOSE .



We'll put together a proper SST post when a few more roll in... and try to not take Greg Ginn too
much to task for his mistakes with the label.

Flotsam, jetsam and Curtom

Play it: Curtom Records



Last week I was alerted by the illustrious J Shifty of the treasure trove of material that
washed up on the shores of the Rhapsody library recently, was much of the Curtom Records
library ( owned now by Rhino .) Since we love indie record labels, and it's black history month,
Curtom Records is a good fit for a playlist/profile.





Image: http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/0/8/1/1/9331180.jpg Curtis Mayfield
started Curtom Records when he left The Impressions to go solo in 1970, and his first batch of
solo releases ( Curtis , Roots , and Superfly ) on that imprint are the cream of the crop as far as
soul goes. Consequently, Curtom was the most important black-owned record label of the
1970's. Curtom Records initially got off the ground so well because of Mayfield's experience
as the staff producer on the famous Chi-town OKeh label , and he knew to surround him with
talented people like Dony Hathaway and Leroy Hutson . Hathaway worked on staff as a musician,
singer and songwriter, while Hutson (who took Mayfield's spot in The Impressions) was given
his own imprint (Gemigo) on the label as an outlet for his activities as a producer and
arranger.



Other artists on the label included the tragic Baby Huey (born James Ramey) who died of a drug
overdose before his album was even released. His backing band, The Babysitters, continued on
oddly enough with a teen-aged Chaka Khan taking over his vocal duties ( Baby Huey and the
Babysitters continue to perform , at a Bar Mitzvah near you.)





Image: http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/3/3/6/1/9331633.jpg Linda Clifford was
Miss New York State at one time, and recorded six albums on Curtom, with "Runaway Love" as her
biggest hit (peaked at number three on the R&B charts, 1978.)



Other acts include The Natural Four (who were produced by LeRoy Hutson,) The Five Stairsteps ,
Ed Townshend (co-wrote "Let's Get it On,") Billy Butler (younger brother to the great Jerry
"Ice Man" Butler ,) Mavis Staples , The Staple Singers , and of course, The Impressions.



Discography of the Curtom Label

The Curtom Story is an import-only 51-song double CD on Charly Records.

No, I wasn't born to rock

Play it: Destroyer This Night

Stream: "Here Comes the Night"

Stream: "Trembling Peacock"

Play it: New Pornographers - Bejar Contributions Relax trembling peacock

No I wasn't born to rock

Oh I was just plain born

and then I kinda grew

and then, well Vancouver made me, I guess it's true

Image: http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/7/6/1/6/9326167.jpg That shaking you feel
is the rumbling of the impending release of Destroyer's Rubies , from New Pornographer Dan
Bejar's outfit Destroyer . Many believe it to be his breakthrough, and it is quite good, from
the half of the album I've been listening to. In anticipation of that, I thought I'd tackle the
first two-thirds of his Vancouver trilogy ( City Of Daughters and Thief ,) as they were in
Rhapsody when I last wrote about Bejar (for The New Pornographers Twin Cinema release.) But,
alas, at some point since then, they've been removed from the Rhaplibrary. All that's left is
Destroyer's Merge debut, This Night (2002,) and while it's an excellent album (many folks'
fave) with plenty to write about, it wasn't what I was prepared for, so forgive this quickly
put-together fumbled review/profile.





Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/9/2/9/0/560929_170x170.jpg To talk about
This Night , you have to go back to the previous three albums ( City Of Daughters , Thief , and
Streethawk: A Seduction ) for the back story. This trilogy about his home city of Vancouver was
obviously a labor of love for Bejar, and when it was finished, I suppose it's appropriate that
he had to get out of his beloved city for the next album. Bejar spent a lot of time in the Mile-End
neighborhood Montreal, and much of This Night reflects that (like "Here Comes the Night:") So
you stole that Schwinn and rode out into the Winner's Circle of the Sun

Now Mile-End is claiming ‘Hey you're one of those! Take off those clothes! You're one of
them! Where previous releases felt very calculated (and Bowie-esque) Bejar here finds
himself trying to both stretch out and contract Destroyer's sound, adding more 'rock' to it,
yet keeping it as loose as possible (perhaps Neil Young-esqe?) I liken it to Neil Young's
Tonight's The Night , and Bejar kind of acknowledges (and refutes) it with his "Tonight is not
your Night" refrain in "Self Portrait With Thing" ( visit Bejar-O-Matic for more obtuse
lyrical fun .)



This Night not the best starting point for the unitiated (until this coming Tuesday's
release, that honor goes to Streethawk: A Seduction ,) as it's sprawling and unfocused,
almost as if listening to songs still being worked out. But it is the best precursor,
style-wise, to ever approaching Rubies , with it's rock instrumentation. Tracks like "Here
Comes the Night" and "Trembling Peacock" contain some of Bejar's best moments caught on tape,
and the album, while excessively long in all respects, has a lot to offer the patient listener -
especially given all it's context, both chronologically in Destroyer's cannon, and
geographically in Bejar's head.

Fighting off the pricks

Play it: New Radiant Storm Kings The Steady Hand

Download: "The Winding Staircase" ( Darla Records )





Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/8/9/0/4/774098_170x170.jpg I already
laid out my love for New Radiant Storm King last June, not realizing they were going to be
putting out another excellent album ( The Steady Hand , released yesterday,) to reinforce
that sentiment. It's been six years since their last ( Winter's Kill , Play It ) was recorded
(1999,) released (2002,) and subsequentially ignored, during which time guitarist/singer
Peyton Pinkerton has had success playing (and recently engineering) with The Pernice
Brothers . Going further back, it's been 17 years since Matt Hunter and Peyton Pinkerton
formed New Radiant Storm King at Hampshire College (Northampton, Ma,) and each record has
shown a growth in maturity (especially since the past few have been spaced out so much.)
Looking back at all the bad luck they've endured ( see their incredible timeline ,) it's
amazing they're even still a band ( especially considering this .)





Image: http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/4/2/4/8/9318424.jpg Peyton Pinkerton's
songs (full band credited for songwriting, but Peyton sings these ones) encompass most of the
highlights here. "The Winding Staircase," "Fighting Off the Pricks," "Quicksand Under
Carpet" and "Come On And Let Yourself Win" are some of the best work Pinkerton's ever written,
immediately brash and pop-y at the same time (much like Bob Mould 's Sugar .) Meanwhile, Matt
Hunter's work here serves more as a change of pace and are slower to grow on you, however "Hands
and Eyes" has already taken up residence in my brain. I remember gravitating to Hunter's work
earlier on in their releases, and it wasn't until '96's amazing Hurricane Necklace before
Pinkerton's songs hit me the way they continue to now.



I'll still take the immaculate Hurricane Necklace as my fave, but this Steady Hand is nearly as
good, and is the perfect time capsule back to mid-90's noise rock... and it sounds as good now as
it would've then.



Maybe this will be their Meadowlands , since they've had a similar story to The Wrens,
especially w/r/t Alan Meltzer and Grass/Wind-Up Records . They could tour together on the
"Screw You Alan Meltzer! Tour." Just an idea.



More:

Darla Records, NRSK's current label, has talked of releasing their out-of-print back
catalogue , specifically My Little Bastard Soul (1992), Rival Time (1993) and Singular, No
Article (1998); each disc replete with bonus tracks including (but not limited to) demos,
singles and hopefully a video or two.

Sweet heart said

Play it: Shelley Short Captain Wild Horse (Rides The Heart Of Tomorrow)

Download: "Tomorrow Night" , "Like Anything, It's Small"





Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/8/1/1/4/774118_170x170.jpg One final
sweet note for your Valentine's day. Shelley Short 's second release, Captain Wild Horse
(Rides the Heart of Tomorrow) (Hush Records,) is a like a little Valentine for your ear. Think
Be Good Tanyas , with a little Patsy Cline thrown in for good measure. Short began her musical
career in Portland but has since moved to Chicago, following a similar trajectory of one Neko
Case (Pacific NW to Windy City,) and perhaps is not such a bad comparison to add as well...with a
bit less of vocal prowess, and more... well... sweetness thrown in.



Enjoy... oh, and Happy Valentine's Day.

The Transfiguration of John Fahey

Play it: I Am The Resurrection: A Tribute to John Fahey

Play it: John Fahey's Original Versions from Tribute

Play it: Return of the Repressed - The John Fahey Anthology

(mostly reassembled from great Rhino compilation)





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/iamtheresurrection.jpg Any
tribute album of John Fahey is bound to fall short of his growing legend. I Am The Resurrection,
however, does achieve one very important thing. It makes you want to hear the real thing. With
contributions from indie stars like Sufjan Stevens , Devendra Banhart and M. Ward , it's
apparent where his influence lies (see Freak Folk Beginnings .)





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/johnfahey.jpg Naturally,
since guitar is the focal point with Fahey, the tribute follows suit (with the exception of
Howie Gelb , who understands that Fahey plays guitar like the piano, and thus interprets "My
Grandfather's Clock" so succinctly.) Other standout tracks include Pelt 's run through
"Sunflower River Blues," Calexico 's "Dance of Death" and the courageous "When the Catfish is
in Bloom" from Peter Case . The rest are a mixed bag (Stevens decides to play up the hymn buried in
"Commemorative Transfiguration and Communion at Magruder Park,") mostly reminding you
just how good Fahey was at his craft. The tracks selected lack the full range of his catalogue
(Native American, Raga, Tibetan chants, sounds of nature, etc.,) and instead focus on what
only influenced them (blues picking,)

Image: http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/6/3/8/6/386836_170x170.jpg which is fair
enough... but it begs a listen to the original ' Blind Joe Death ' himself. An excellent
compilation is Rhino's Return of the Repressed: The John Fahey Anthology , which isn't in
Rhapsody, but I've mostly reassembled here for you ( Play it .)



Also listen to selections from the tribute on Myspace.com's site for the album .

So love is in the air... I'm feeling it. Buying my chocolates, thinking of my sweetie-pie,
anticipating putting my son to sleep tonight, etc. That's all you need to know.



I put the above playlist together last year, but never bothered to post on it for some reason.
Looking back now, it just might be one the best playlists I've ever done. Certainly not a
romantic one, but...any playlist that can get Billie Holiday , Drive-By Truckers , Prince ,
David Bowie , King's X , Blondie , Syd Barrett , Of Montreal , Buddy Holly , Yaz and Beat Happening
all together under one tent deserves some sort of pat on the back, even if it's my own hand doing
the patting ;)

Can't stop walking

Play it: Eli's Walking





Image: http://static.flickr.com/26/99039796_1c611341d2_m.jpg Ok... first off, the kid
took his first steps almost a month ago, but I was waiting to capture it on camera. Problem is,
anytime you pull out the camera, Eli stops and walking and poses. Anway, this weekend he
started pulling himself up on his own and walking all over the place. Now you can't keep in a
stroller/high chair/backpack, etc. for very long because he demands to be untethered and
walking.



So here's a tribute to first steps, with The Flaming Stars and I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the
House . I've thrown in some Robert Pollard because Eli's got Pollard's rock pose down now (like
a "50-Year Old Baby,") complete with spilling his bottle down his chin. I'm also anticipating
seeing Pollard live two weeks from tomorrow night.

from the Languedoc region of France for this go 'round,) this time w/o wife and child (wife
feeling under the weather, child ready for bedtime.) Following our wine guzzling, our
excellent host (Kevin) informed us that the band Akron/Family was playing across the street,
the prospect of which made me very happy. Their self-titled debut has been haunting me for the
past couple months, and I was eager to see what was behind this Brooklyn quartet's compelling
freak folk sound.



The band deftly employs dynamics, which can be a challenge live as there were some talkative
attendees who were making it difficult to pick up some of the quieter moments. But outside of
that, the intensity and enthusiasm that Akron/Family displayed were contagious, and I found
myself swept up in their soundscape (with help, no doubt, from a belly full of good wine.) Much
of the performance is improvisational in nature, which is briefly disconcerting, but then
out of the blue they'll join lockstep in beautiful 4-part harmony.





Image: http://static.flickr.com/40/99110898_6f5e3ed83d_m.jpg At the end of the show,
they wandered into the audience w/ acoustic instruments and hand percussion, and by the end,
all of us were giddily adding our voices to the harmony of "peace and distance."



A lot of wine, a few tall PBR's and an amazing live performance had this music fan staggering
home in the cold with a smile on his face.



Akron/Family also appeared on Michael Gira 's Angels of Light album The Angels Of Light Sing
"Other People" ( Play the album .)

How to warm up the winter games

Play it: Carla Bruni Quelqu'un M'a Dit

Download: Carla Bruni "Le Ciel Dans Une Chambre"





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/carlabruni.jpg The Winter
Olympics opening ceremony got a much needed boost from the appearance of Turin-born model
turned singer Carla Bruni . She carried the Italian flag in for the ceremony, which is fine if
you forget the fact that she was raised in France and considers her primary language to be
French (she sings in French anway.) But what other Turin native is gonna fill that Armani gown
but Bruni?



Really, this is just an excuse to put her mug on the page. You may remember Carla as Mick Jagger's
mistress , or her liasons with Eric Clapton, Donald Trump or Kevin Costner . Well, she left the
modeling (and mistress) world awhile ago, and has since used her well-earned connections to
break into the music biz. Her album, Quelqu'un M'a Dit , was released last year and actually is
pretty good (even if her face wasn't on the cover.) Her breath-y vocal delivery is incredibly
pleasant, and most of the album is quite captivating, like Bruni herself . Just take a listen to
the opening and title track ("Quelqu'un M'a Dit") and be swept up in it.... like a luge (or
something segue-ish back to the Winter Olympics ;)

Mucha Lucha Libre!

Play it: Viaje de Puerto Vallarta

Video: Nacho Libre Trailer

Download: "Mucha Lucha" by Chicos de Barrio

Play it: Mucha Lucha (Soundtrack selections)





Image: http://static.flickr.com/24/96243239_d55eb90dc1_m.jpg I just got back from
Puerto Vallarta, and I've got Lucha Libre fever! I didn't actually witness any while I was
there, but saw plenty of the Lucha masks for sale (and I did buy my son a Mucha Lucha hat .) One of
the reasons I didn't buy a mask, is on my way home from my half-bro's wedding (at the beautiful
Quinta Maria Cortez B&B,) I lost my wallet in the cab (not, as legend has it, in El Segundo .) And
since my wife left her wallet at home, we were in a pickle. Thankfully, my newly discovered
family was able to come to our rescue... I guess borrowing money really makes us family now.





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/luchavavoom_vday06.jpg
Back to the hook of the post, Lucha Libre is loosely translated as 'freestyle wrestling' and in
Mexico has a rich tradition involving masks and signature moves. The wrestlers are called
"luchadores" (or singularly, a "luchador",) and are commonly divided in two groups - the
rudos (bad guys) and the tÃ©cnicos (good guys.) There's a couple federations in Mexico ( the
AAA , and the CMLL ,) but have found popular offshoot shows in the US as well, specifically Lucha
Va Voom ( who has an annual Valentine's 3-Day Show coming up this week in LA .)





Image: http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/0/6/4/4/9274460.jpg When I got back earlier
this week, one of the first things I noticed forwarded to me via email, was the trailer for the
new movie Nacho Libre , starring Jack Black . Directed by Jared and Jerusha Hess ( Napoleon
Dynamite ) and written by Mike White ( School of Rock , Orange County , Jack Black's next door
neighbor ) and that's pretty much all you need to know to want to watch. It's about time someone
capitalized on the Lucha Libre phenomenon , and I'm glad it's this triumvirant (Hess, White,
Black) that's doing it (and not Ben Stiller, for instance.) ( Play video trailer .)





Image: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/639/200/muchalucha.jpg But it's been
ripe for some time, even a kid's cartoon has made a go of it. Mucha Lucha started in 2002, and it
became an international hit (it's getting huge in Mexico, and it's even in Gaelic now .) I've
got the DVD of the first six seasons on hold for me at the library, so I'm stoked for that.
