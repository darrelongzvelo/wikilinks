"Appleseed Elementary"



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u5j8ku3WfGU/T26sLB27PDI/AAAAAAAACT4/fw27k1W5AnE/s1600/Appleseed-02.jpg
Here's a webseries that will take you back. Appleseed Elementary . In the wide brown land, that
would be a Primary s chool , but this is an American series. 

As you've already guessed, there's the eager new teacher, an assortment of burnouts and
no-hopers, and a troubled Principal. But there are no psycho nuns with rulers to whack you on
your bare legs until you cry, so it looks pretty good to me.

Appleseed Elementary is w ritten by Kirsten Clark and Jerrod Clark, and directed by Adam
Siegel . Beyond that, all I can say is, they're not much into explaining their work.

Anyway, here's Episode 1.

Image:
http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=adelaidscreen-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1419897543 , I
came across a piece Schwarz wrote for The Guardian , called Dustin Hoffman and me . It includes
the following anecdote.

It was August 1979, a rainy night in an old beach house on the Atlantic coast. I was 14 years
old. John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men was on my summer reading list for school and, after
dinner, as my family drifted back into the living room to sit by the fire, one of our house guests
– a famous, energetic and physically unprepossessing actor with a prominent nose and flat,
nasal voice – picked up my copy of the book, opened it at the first page and began performing it
aloud, inhabiting the disparate minds and voices of the protagonists George and Lennie with
uncanny precision. At first, self-conscious smiles appeared in our makeshift audience,
though we quickly realised that this extraordinary display was no laughing matter. We were
meant to watch and listen, which we did – for hours, as the rain beat down on the roof, the
branches of the pine trees scraped and tapped against the windows, and the fire burned to
embers. And when the hulking man-child Lennie (twice our guest's size, one had to assume)
ended up crushing another man with his bare hands, and the rage drained from his powerful
limbs, his terrible confusion – he had wanted to protect, not to hurt – made him, in the
actor's sublime incarnation, what he truly was, both wolf and lamb.

I stayed for the duration, hardly moving in my seat. A trip to the bathroom was out of the
question; the bathroom from which, earlier in the day, behind the locked door with the whaling
ship painted on it, I had overheard my mother quietly sobbing (three months later, she asked my
father to move out of the house, which he did). When the performance was finally over, and with a
curtain-call bow of triumph, the actor handed me back my book, his sweaty fingerprints still
on the cover, tragedy for me was no longer just a notion in a story, but a ghost in our house.

For a couple of years at the end of the 1970s, Dustin Hoffman was a fixture in our family. My
father was his lawyer and friend. Dustin was a movie star at the peak of his fame, the most
intelligent and brilliant actor any of us had ever met, and he was with us a lot, making us laugh,
entertaining us, opening doors to worlds brighter than our own, observing our ways and moods
and accidents, our spilled drinks and sullen glances and careless goodnight kisses, never
missing a beat. And we enjoyed it mostly, and depended on it, until in every respect that
particular show came to the end of its run. Great actors are different to the rest of us. If
you're interested in acting, and in the way one will ruthlessly exploit the pain of others in a
quest for acting greatness, it is worth reading the article in full .

Book review: "On Directing Film"



Image:
http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=0140127224&MarketPlace=US&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=adelaidscreen-20&ServiceVersion=20070822
The book, On Directing Film

Image:
http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=adelaidscreen-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0140127224 by
David Mamet , was recommended to me by Brian McDonald . He said: 

It is ostensibly about directing, but it’s really about telling stories with pictures.
This is a thing that most screenwriters have almost no idea how to do. Most screenwriters write
radio plays, not screenplays. This is a visual medium. Learn to use the pictures. It's a small
book, just over 100 pages in paperback. The focus is on the weakness of most wannabe
screenwriters —how to tell stories with pictures.



Here are a few quotes from the book:

A good writer gets better only by learning to cut , to remove the ornamental, the descriptive,
the narrative, and especially the deeply felt and meaningful. What remains? The story
remains. What is the story? The story is the essential progression of incidents that occur to
the hero in pursuit of his one goal.



The point, as Aristotle told us, is what happens to the hero ... not what happens to the writer.

Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4YoAJQIAJew/T5OYYaK_yEI/AAAAAAAACwo/gGMrKVFhcMc/s1600/Mamet+-+1A.jpg
House of Games (1987) Screenwriting is a craft based on logic, It consists of the assiduous
application of several very basic questions: What does the hero want? What hinders him from
getting it? What happens if he does not get it?  We don't have to worry about creating a
problem. We make a better movie if we worry about restoring order. Because if we worry about
creating problems, our protagonist is going to do things that are interesting. We don't want
him to do that. We want him to do things that are logical.

Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2-MVIqRCnM/T5N9YEmkU0I/AAAAAAAACwY/_a_OsgyE2oU/s1600/Mamet+-+1.jpg
Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) If you listen to the way people tell stories, you will hear that they
tell them cinematically. They jump from one thing to the next, and the story is moved along by
the juxtaposition of images—which is to say, by the cut .

   People say, "I'm standing on the corner. It's a foggy day. A bunch of people are running
around crazy. Might have been the full moon. All of a sudden, a car comes up and the guy next to me
says..."

   If you think about it, that's a shot list: (1) a guy standing on the corner; (2) shot of fog;
(3) a full moon shining above; (4) a man says, "I think people get whacky this time of year"; (5) a
car approaching.

   This is good filmmaking, to juxtapose images. Now you're following the story. What, you
wonder, is going to happen next.

Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-weqUHl7_Is0/T5N_G0dL1KI/AAAAAAAACwg/_QLrvtD009o/s1600/Mamet+-+2.jpg
State and Main (2000) The work of the director is the work of constructing the shot list from the
script. The work on the set is nothing. All you have to do on the set is stay awake, follow your
plans, help the actors be simple, and keep your sense of humor. The film is directed in the
making of the shot list. The work on the set is simply to record what has been chosen to be
recorded. It is the plan that makes the movie.



We can identify with the pursuit of a goal. It's much easier to identify with that than with
"character traits."

Wag the Dog (1997) Always do things the least interesting way, and you will make a better movie.
This is my experience. Always do things the least interesting way, the most blunt way. Because
then you will not stand the risk of falling afoul of the objective in the scene by being
interesting, which will always bore the audience, who are collectively much smarter than you
and me and have already gotten up to the punch line. How do we keep their attention? Certainly
not by giving them more information but, on the contrary, by withholding information — by
withholding all information except that information the absence of which would make the
progress of the story incomprehensible.

Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iyO7fHqh23g/T5OeUfRRBMI/AAAAAAAACww/sihtK1EhLpk/s1600/Mamet+-+4.jpg
Heist (2001)

You tell the story. Don't let the protagonist tell the story. You tell the story; you direct it.
We don't have to follow the protagonist around. We don't have to establish his "character." We
don't need to have anybody's "back story." If you are telling a story, then the human mind, as
it's working along with you, is perceiving your thrust, both consciously and, more
importantly, subconsciously. The audience members are going to go along with that story and
will require neither inducement, in the form of visual extravagance, nor explanation, in the
form of narration.

   They want to see what's happening next . Is the guy going to get killed? Is the girl going to
kiss him? Will they find the money buried in the old gold mine?

   When the film is correctly designed, the subconscious and conscious are in alignment,
and we need to hear what happens next. The audience is ordering the events just as the author
did, so we are in touch with both his conscious and his unconscious mind. We have become
involved in the story. On Directing Film

An interview with Billy Marshall Stoneking



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zhzy4-7Ds0Y/T4pNmUW-I_I/AAAAAAAACo8/iCDkt17DZKU/s1600/Billy+Marshall+Stoneking-9.jpg
Billy Marshall Stoneking is an Australian screenwriter, poet and teacher who, though now
based in Sydney, was born in the USA. He migrated to Australia in 1972, where he wrote the TV
series Stringer and an episode of the show Mission: Impossible . 

   Billy will be teaching a one-day seminar in Adelaide on May 20, followed by a four-day
seminar. I met him online and took the opportunity of asking some questions.
________________________________________________________________________

*  You didn’t go to film school, though you taught at the Australian Film Television and
Radio School (AFTRS) for a number of years. How would you respond to David Mamet ’s suspicion
that film schools are “ useless ”? I did attend the film school — AFTRS — 1983 graduate,
and I agree with David Mamet. Most film schools I know of, and I have been associated with a few of
the ones in Sydney, are run by people who don’t really understand story or drama and have,
overall, very little talent in the art of teaching. Schools tend to place more importance on
buildings and equipment and technique than they do on discovery, risk and inspiration. 
   I am reminded of Whitehead ’s comment: “The secondhandness of the learned world is
the secret of its mediocrity."     Film schools simply don’t give their students enough
opportunities to enter the drama. Drama is a language for presenting emotional energy and if
you’re to become fluent in the language you have to use it, all the time. If a scene is the
equivalent of a sentence and the language is drama, how can you possibly learn it making only
ten or fifteen or thirty scenes a year. If you compared that to learning Spanish you’d have a
very hard time getting yourself around Mexico City — let alone a compelling screenplay.
Film schools, at best, teach little more than “tourist drama”.

*  What are three things you wish someone had told you about screenwriting when you were
starting out ? It’s what I wish they hadn’t told me, but I’ll take a stab at it: 1) "No"
always means "maybe";  2) Knowledge has nothing to do with it; and  3) Never go to bed with
anyone that has more problems than you do.

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h7Y5Zcq5EA4/T4rA43NpDQI/AAAAAAAACpQ/EmCT6MZTbw4/s1600/Billy+Marshall+Stoneking-12.jpg
*  You famously wrote an episode of the TV series Mission: Impossible . How did that come about
? Impeccable connections — plus the producer wanted to option my best-selling book,
Lasseter: In Quest of Gold .

*  That episode of Mission: Impossible was directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith , one of the
most influential of all Australian directors. Did you work closely with him, and if so, what
did you learn from the experience ? I know Brian from the old days, but I didn’t confer with him
about his job. The script was fairly self-explanatory — as most of them were.



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dWOQqSm1a94/T4tvzdNcWtI/AAAAAAAACpk/jC0B2hyL5i4/s1600/Tutama+Tjapangarti.jpg
Tutama Tjapangarti *  Who was the person who has had the biggest influence on you as a
screenwriter ?   Tutama Tjapangarti would be up there with the best of them, though he never
wrote a screenplay, or anything else for that matter — but wow — what a storyteller!    
Others would have to include John Cassavetes , Ingmar Bergman , James Agee , and Woody Allen .

*  You are a script consultant with Script Central , which has been in business since 2003. 
Can you give us one example of a script which passed through that agency and eventually become a
decent Australian movie ?   Not offhand.



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nfc3ivm0wcE/T4t1uZI1b6I/AAAAAAAACqE/4PRq-6dPHn4/s1600/Maya+Newell.jpg
Maya Newell *  Who would you consider the most interesting filmmaker currently working in
Australia, and why ?   Maya Newell — she’s fresh, she’s smart, and she’s a very close
friend.

*  How would you respond to the proposition that, these days, it is easier to make money
teaching screenwriting than it is practicing screenwriting ?   Anyone who thinks teaching
is easy has taken leave of their senses.

*  What has been the most memorable moment in your career to date ?   Every moment. I don’t
think of it as a career.



Image:
http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=0553272950&MarketPlace=US&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=adelaidscreen-20&ServiceVersion=20070822
*  What one book would you recommend to a young wannabe screenwriter in Adelaide ?  Audition

Image:
http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=adelaidscreen-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0553272950 by
Michael Shurleff —don’t touch any of the others.

*  What are your ten favourite movies of all time ? 

[ Billy provided a list of almost 200 movies. I really did want just ten, so have selected a
representative sample from the longer list; which will probably offend him, but I'm sure
we'll get over that. Life's too short, etc. You can see his full and evolving list here . ]
Indecent Xposure (2011)

City Lights (1931)

Lagaan (2001)

The Castle (1997)

The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976) Working Girl (1988)

The Conversation (1974)

LÃ©on: The Professional (1994) Network (1976)

Seven Samurai (1954) *  You’re teaching a one-day seminar in Adelaide on 20 May 2012 called
‘Secrets, Lies and Filmmaking,’ followed by a four-day seminar called ‘The Drama of
Screenwriting.’ What would you say to a young wannabe screenwriter to convince them to take
time off work, and part with a handful of cash, in order to attend either of these events ?   They
wont be taking time off work, they’ll be taking time off their job — there’s a
difference. What they’ll do in the four-day workshop is work creatively in ways that they
have never before experienced. It’s very much a learner-centred workshop — no sage on the
stage — and its very collaborative.     What participant/writers go away with is an
entirely new and useable way of looking at themselves and their characters and the stories
they want to tell. Ditto for the one-day, but because it is only one day it is even more intense!

"Thijs and the ladies"



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4r8_zNK7r94/T26i_ixcEPI/AAAAAAAACTY/-zCKO29apbY/s1600/Thijs.jpg
How many actors do you need to make a short film? How about one actor, armed with a mirror?



Here's the first episode of a Dutch web series that featured at the 2011 Marseille Web Fest . The
story line focuses on a hapless individual who is on the hunt for a girlfriend. 



The film has English subtitles, but you could probably follow it without their help.

Overcoming your fears



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XEcpLNpJCL8/T2K1ZKpKp6I/AAAAAAAACKM/WTdR_r2VhXc/s1600/Exposure.jpg
Public ridicule. Pigeons. Heights. Asking a girl out. Pigeons. They're all common fears
people suffer from. Especially pigeons .

If you ever wondered how to overcome your fears, meet a bloke who managed to defeat most of his.

Written and directed by Ross Johnston , somewhere in Belfast . Shot and edited by Neal Megaw .
Naturally they didn't mention the names of the actors in this short film; they were
concentrating on the pigeons.

"I Hate Being Single"



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qZyrxIPs1Rk/T2q8EEuSHLI/AAAAAAAACQg/ELIKRHDgh6g/s200/Rob+Michael+Hugel.jpg
I Hate Being Single was created, written by, and stars Rob Michael Hugel . It is a webseries that
puts an unconventional comedic spin on a story we've all heard many times before.  Rob, a
recently dumped self-admitted hipster, blunders through single life trying to figure out
where he belongs in a manner that is charmingly clueless and entertaining. Described as a mix
between Curb Your Enthusiasm , Portlandia , Louie , Flight of the Conchords , I Hate Being
Single takes a look at the Williamsburg Brooklyn scene from the inside out, as an response to
the wave of other Brooklyn-based shows, 2 Broke Girls , I Just Want My Pants Back , How To Make it
in America , The New Girl . Here is Episode One.

Ira Glass on the Building Blocks of Story



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GLmsmXkSQoA/T2XcMvjETUI/AAAAAAAACOI/CxzD43GB1e4/s1600/Ira+Glass.jpg
Some of you are already asking, Who is Ira Glass ? 



He's a first cousin to composer Philip Glass . Fans of The Wire will appreciate that he was born
in Baltimore and attended Milford Mill High School in Baltimore County. Today he is the voice
of This American Life (TAL), a weekly hour-long radio program that he has served as producer
and host since 1995. For more info on TAL, click here .



Put simply, the guy tells stories. He's been doing it a long time and has hundreds of thousands
of listeners who come back for more every week, which suggests he has some skills.



Here is part one of a four-part video in which he talks about The Building Blocks of Story .





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FM63dyil5y8/T2XXkklCcoI/AAAAAAAACOA/t7D1LpY9Qqg/s1600/TAL.png
There are two basic building blocks to stories: 1. The anecdote. A sequence of actions; a story
in its purest form; with a bit of bait. ( Raise questions from the﻿ beginning. If you raise a
question, it's implied that you're going to provide an answer along the way. That keeps people
interested .)



2. The moment of reflection. What it all means. ( You need to provide both for it all to come
together and be larger than the sum of its parts .) The picture on this video is a bit fuzzy, but
the sound is clear.



    Part 2     Part 3     Part 4

Book review: "Rebel Without a Crew"



Image:
http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=0452271878&MarketPlace=US&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=adelaidscreen-20&ServiceVersion=20070822

Image:
http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=adelaidscreen-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0452271878 The
best part of my recent holiday at Victor Harbor was the fact that I finally got to read Robert
Rodriguez 's book, Rebel Without a Crew . It's been around since 1995 and can be found on most
recommended reading lists for filmmakers. 



These days, Rodriguez is best known for the four Spy Kids

Image:
http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=adelaidscreen-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005067GMO
films, his relationship with Rose McGowan , the fact he still lives in Austin Texas , and his
filmmaking association with Quentin Tarantino . 



Image:
http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=B0000A2ZTY&MarketPlace=US&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=adelaidscreen-20&ServiceVersion=20070822

Image:
http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=adelaidscreen-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0000A2ZTY Rebel
Without a Crew is based on a journal Rodriguez kept from 1991 to 1993, the period during which he
planned, made, sold, and publicised his first feature film, El Mariachi

Image:
http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=adelaidscreen-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0000A2ZTY
(1993). 

Although the book deals with his adventures as a filmmaker, it has a bit to say to writers.   I
was never big on writing scripts. I have read many times that the best way to learn to write
scripts is to actually sit down and write two full scripts and after you're done you should
throw them away. You'll learn a lot by doing those first two but they'll be awful, so after you
write them you should throw them away and start writing your real script. The idea didn't
appeal to Rodriguez. He had made about thirty short films at that point, starting from when he
was twelve. He was now twenty-three. He needed motivation to write a script and the idea of
tossing his work away afterward didn't fill him with enthusiasm.



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0FkZpWpr3Dk/T4eTFnpV4UI/AAAAAAAACmY/FZRzuewqgmI/s1600/Robert+Rodriguez.jpg
It suddenly hit me: Instead of writing two scripts and throwing them away afterwards, why not
just take the scripts and make them for really low budgets? That way while you're practicing
your writing skills you can also practice your filmmaking skills. That's what I decided to do
with El Mariachi . I would write two scripts, both about the same character, but I would film
them on a low, low budget all by myself. Then I would sell them to the Spanish video market where
no one in the movie business would see them if they were no good, so it was almost like throwing
them away, only I would get paid for them.



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-89gAEwyGqJc/T4e-5YSJzPI/AAAAAAAACmg/2qFi3FLplCk/s1600/El+Mariachi-1.jpg
He was inventing a film school with just one pupil, himself. His teachers would be his own
experiences, mistakes, problems and solutions, and the burgeoning Spanish-language video
market would return him his investment. 

I went on to write the first Mariachi in three weeks. It's amazing how quickly ideas come to you
for a script when you're going to be actually making the movie in a few months, not just writing
for writing's sake.



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y3F-Y95MgYU/T4fAehVqJAI/AAAAAAAACmw/7PJiQeJLRSo/s1600/El+Mariachi-2.jpg

Where this story gets interesting is with his fund-raising methods. Robert Rodriguez has
been a human lab rat four times. Which is to say, he voluntarily submitted to being locked up in a
pharmaceutical drug testing facility and experimented on, in return for hard cash. When it
came time for me to make El Mariachi , I needed someplace quiet to write and earn money at the same
time. Naturally the research hospital fit the bill. I knew that if I checked in for a monthlong
drug study I could clear about $3,000, with room and board paid for, and have plenty of time to
kick back and write my script. ...  In my mind I simply imagined that I was getting paid to write
a script. The reality wasn't that simple, but I'll leave it for you to read for yourself. The
next stage, the story of how he filmed a feature film, with minimal assistance, makes the book
worth reading on its own, but I will skip over that as well. 





Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1247MUfL8cE/T4fAmLgdpxI/AAAAAAAACm4/rkEfXWR144s/s1600/El+Mariachi-4.jpg

Once the film was finished, Rodriguez went to Los Angeles in the hope of selling El Mariachi

Image:
http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=adelaidscreen-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0000A2ZTY to one
of the Spanish language film distributors. It is difficult to believe, but after making
thirty short films and his first feature film, Rodriguez had still never seen a professional
screenplay.

On our way back to the apartment we stopped by the Hollywood Book Store and I bought the script to
Road Warrior [ better known to Australians as Mad Max 2 ] so I can have something to read. My
script for El Mariachi was completely mis-formatted, which is why my thirty-five-page
script ended up being a ninety-minute movie.

Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CqM7_I-PsME/T4e_JKpS3AI/AAAAAAAACmo/DtBdjkCERZc/s1600/El+Mariachi-5.jpg
The section of the book covering his dealings with various agents and Hollywood studios is a
real eye-opener as well. That is followed by his triumphant tour of the Film Festivals, a
section called 'The Robert Rodriguez Ten-Minute Film Course,' and a copy of the original
script for El Mariachi .

Rebel Without a Crew is a highly readable, informative and inspiring book. Take a look at it
sometime. Posted by Henry Sheppard at 06:00 1 comments

Lie spotting has become a science that is already creating problems for people involved in
performance arts, especially actors, but also for writers. It's our job to mislead our
audiences, at least for part of the journey. The better they become at spotting the lies, the
less effective our story-telling will be.

And, of course, there's the other thing, about not wanting to be conned ourselves. On any given
day we're lied to from ten to 200 times, and the clues to detecting those lies can be subtle and
counter-intuitive. Pamela Meyer, author of Liespotting

shows the manners and "hotspots" used by people trained to recognize deception—and she
argues honesty is a value worth preserving. This is another long video, about 19 minutes, but
worth watching. 

Honest.

How can I meet other writers?



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8IS_4GG7w_M/T26CzjhPVWI/AAAAAAAACTA/yk3XGVrQxuY/s200/Sean+Connery.jpg
As has been mentioned elsewhere, I struggled to make contact with other writers when I was
first starting out. I'm not your smooth, chatty, man-about-town type. I do have some things in
common with James Bond , but most of them are imaginary. 



In my early days, I attended industry events and listened to people. I attended seminars and
training days, and listened to other people . I went to lunches, where I did a lot of listening.
Eventually I'd done so much listening that people, having talked themselves out, asked me
about my writing. And so it began.



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TMi71De6HMQ/T26DfcrcI5I/AAAAAAAACTI/frfUaDfSD2k/s1600/James+Bond-01.jpg
When meeting a criminal mastermind's enforcer , I always stand with my hands in my pockets ,
like James Bond .   ( Don't try this with producers. They'll suspect you of playing pocket
billiards, and worry it could result in complications at meetings. ) One thing led to another.
A few years ago, some of the people I met established a writers' group in Adelaide. At the first
meeting, a stranger informed us that he wrote a new screenplay every week. He was a
screenwriting ninja. A guru. A kung fu master of the black art. Then he asked us, "What's a
Treatment ?"

That was my introduction to the curious fact that ( the idea of ) screenwriting attracts a
percentage of weirdos. I started this blog as a place where new writers in Adelaide could make
contact online. Some great people have come along since and are now part of one of the three
screenwriting groups meeting in Adelaide.

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j6tLhuitlHE/T460m5qMAQI/AAAAAAAACr0/qPjViaOZM5w/s1600/James+Bond-1.jpg
When a criminal mastermind is about to cut me in half, I pretend to know his story, like James
Bond. ( Don't fake story with producers, though, they'll test you on theme and structure and,
if they detect BS, you'll have sliced up your own career .) Most of the new contacts have been
lovely people, but there were some others. Like the guy who announced his presence, but
refused to answer any questions about his experience and areas of interest, saying instead
that he would be the one asking all the questions. He followed that with a series of e-mails in
which he expressed his growing dissatisfaction with my level of service. My favorite bit was
this:

Can you pass my email to someone else at Adelaide screenwriters for me to communicate with
because clearly we are unable to communicate and I am asking that you personally do not email me
ever again. Due to you not understanding me in the past, I will say it again; this means that I
never want to hear from again Henry. If they don't understand you, it is clearly the fault of the
audience. Find yourself a different audience .   — Screenwriting 101. 



    For the rest, a few tips to help you get started:

    - Don't be afraid of going up to strangers at industry events, and saying, "Hullo. I'm Joe
    Bloggs. I'm a writer." I met people doing that. I had to get used to them calling me "Joe,"
    but it was worth it.

    

    - At your first meeting with other writers, avoid mentioning your problem with the gamma
    beams from Jupiter messing with your mind. 

    

    - If you believe writers' groups are part of a conspiracy to steal your ideas and exclude
    you from the Hollywood Millionaires Club, you're probably right. Don't give them the
    satisfaction. 

    

    - It's okay to impress other writers by providing a long list of famous writing teachers
    with whom you have a special relationship. They might check up, though, so it's best if you
    only mention people you have, in fact, met at least once.

    

    

    - Try telling the truth about your lack of experience. All the famous writers started out
    having written nothing and knowing nothing about screenwriting. Then they learned.
    Often in company with others.

    

    - If you experiment with the random use of phrases like "Excuse me," "Please," and "Thank
    you," they might teach you the secret handshake.

    

    - Instead of claiming to have a black belt in screenwriting, admit you've never even seen a
    professional screenplay, and only have a single, half-baked idea for a movie that you got
    from watching something on late-night television that you're now hoping everyone in
    Hollywood has forgotten about. We all start out from where we are.

    

    - Writers' groups work best where there is a high level of trust among the members. This
    trust emerges from respect, a common interest, and the willingness of people to make
    themselves vulnerable by speaking openly about their ideas. 

    



This rant was inspired by a combination of my real-life experiences as a screenwriting
blogger and a post on Write Here, Write Now by Lucy V. Hay, called How Do I Make New Contacts ? It's
short but good. Go read it now.

"Street Art" - PBS - Off Book

PBS , for those who don't know, is the Public Broadcasting Service , a non-profit American
television network. They broadcast a range of programs, most noticably for Australians, the
PBS NewsHour , which is home to people like Jim Lehrer , David Brooks and Mark Shields .



They also have their own YouTube channel , with almost 5,000 videos uploaded. Part of that is a
sub-channel called "Off Book", a web-exclusive series that explores cutting edge art,
focused on a new generation of artists.

No, it's an optical illusion, done in chalk. Street art, at it's most challenging... This
video is called Street Art . It's different, but I like it.

The street is a space where art thrives, and a place where artists can shape the public
aesthetic. Olek , a sculptor whose medium is crochet, and Swoon , a mixed media artist, disrupt
daily life with work that creates wonder, emotion, and humor. Equally at home in museums and
galleries, both artists also create installations that challenge the formats of
traditional art spaces. With powerful layers of meaning, beautiful aesthetics, and using
unique media, these two prolific creators are pushing the boundaries of contemporary art.

An interview with Nate Golon



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IPlcvMkEJsE/T3rr1jSOg4I/AAAAAAAACcQ/tG1WTqg6XLQ/s1600/Nate+Golon-1.jpg
Last February I received an e-mail from a young filmmaker who asked me to feature a short film,
he'd just made, on this blog. The film was Briefcase , a six minute short which opens with a
night-time shot of a guy inflating a tyre at a service station. I'd been in that exact position,
pumping up tyres at a local service station, many times. The view looked so familiar I assumed
the film had been made in Adelaide.

   In fact it had been made in Los Angeles, as I realised later. The filmmaker was Nate Golon .
He has more front than Ned Kelly , as we used to say; a traditional Australian virtue. So I ran the
film. I admire a bit of chutzpah . 

   Then I forgot about it, until I received another e-mail from him, this time telling me he'd
engineered a unique outcome — he'd sold his film to Netflix ( something we don't have access
to in Australia ), while still retaining control of it. I felt there was nothing else for me to
do: I had to ask him some questions.

________________________________________________________________________



* What's the story with your Netflix deal ? Netflix now offers a VOD feature in most new TVs, and
they were looking for a cinematic-looking short film that they could use in retail stores
worldwide, as an "example" of what kind of quality movies Netflix offers, even though Netflix
won't offer Briefcase as a rental. It's really a win-win, because I can still develop the
concept into a feature film, and keep it online.





Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2yuxnvYIIQQ/T3-YbgU3jMI/AAAAAAAACgw/nSvrGFtl3kQ/s1600/Briefcase-1.jpg
* Is that it, for Briefcase , or will you continue to develop it ?

I'm planning on developing Briefcase into a feature film. I'm also going to develop a
different concept, a thriller/action trilogy, with each film being five minutes long, that I
will star in.

* Anything else you're working on ? I'm currently starring in a play in Los Angeles. 



* What show is that ? Henrik Ibsen 's Ghosts at the Edgemar Center for the Arts . It runs through
the end of May. It's a five character play, and I'm one of the two leads. It's a challenging
piece, one that takes a lot of focus and energy.  

[If you're in the LA area, all the details for the show are here:  
http://edgemar.org/events/309 .]

*  Your upbringing might best be described as ‘trans-American.’ How did your childhood
help you prosper in Hollywood ? I hated my childhood when I was living it. My family moved all the
time, and I grew up on the West Coast, East Coast, and then in various places in Colorado through
high school. It was hard to make good friends, because just when I'd start to make some, we would
move.    Looking back now, it really had some advantages. I had to be outgoing, because I was
always coming to a new place and being the new kid. I also was needing to reinvent myself all the
time. Some of the areas we lived in were nice, some were not. I grew up around people of all
backgrounds, ethnicities, and socioeconomic levels, and I had to find a way to constantly fit
in. It's made it so that these days, no one is ever a stranger to me, and I'll talk to anyone. It's
also a huge benefit in acting, as I find it easier to understand where characters are coming
from, no matter what their background is. I can always find something about that character to
relate to.

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PUe63jDgiy4/T4AIJPWnCUI/AAAAAAAACiM/fGu1iTnTimE/s1600/Evel+Knievel.jpg
Evel Knievel *  You first appeared in a biography, as Evel Knievel . What was that like ? It was
great!  I was living in Seattle , and had just been bitten by the acting bug. I knew little about
acting at the time, and auditioned for the role from a post I saw on Craigslist. It was a History
Channel reenactment of Evel Knievel's life, hosted by Matthew McConaughey . I played Evel
Knievel in his young, wild days, when he was robbing banks, getting arrested for kidnapping
his estranged wife, and starting to make a name for himself. The producers let me watch a whole
bunch of interview footage of Evel, and the guy was a trip.





Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MyNFUvkAiow/T4AFS-L3qnI/AAAAAAAACh8/4R0tjEu8FQI/s1600/Lucy+Honigman.jpg
Lucy Honigman *  I notice that you claim to be able to do an Australian accent. Meryl Streep
failed that test. (Her attempt was painful to Australian ears.) Americans attempting to
sound like Australians usually come over as Cockneys with a bad cold. Have any Australians
approved your claim ? There's an Australian actress ( Lucy Honigman ) in my play, Ghosts , and
she says my Australian accent does sound like a Cockney with a bad cold. Oh well.

*  Briefcase wasn’t your first attempt at filmmaking. What was the background to that ?
Before I created the film, I wrote, produced, and starred in a comedic web series, called
Workshop , that follows six struggling actors trying to make it in Hollywood. We released
Season 1 of Workshop online in 2009, as thirteen episodes, 7-10 minutes each . T he show was
nominated for five Best Web Series awards. 

   I learned a ton from doing that, which was the first thing I had ever written or produced.
From what I learned from that first season, I wrote a second season in 2010. Season 2 ended up
being six episodes of 22 minutes, and debuted on Hulu in April 2011 as the first ever
independently produced half-hour comedy ever to air on the site. 

 [Both seasons of Workshop can be found at http://workshoptheseries.com .]

*  What have you learned about making webseries TV ? What I learned from doing those two
seasons of Workshop was that for something to be successful online, it needs to have a short,
concise story that moves quickly. People do not have the attention spans when they are online
that they do when watching TV or film. If a video online is slow or boring, people can click away,
and there's lots of other content. 

   When I created Briefcase , I had a few goals in mind. Most importantly, it had to tell a
cohesive story in six minutes or less. In my opinion, when someone clicks a video that they're
unfamiliar with, and it's over six minutes, they are less likely to watch it. 

   I also wanted to create a project that makes you want to watch it twice to figure out exactly
what's going on. All the answers to what is happening in Briefcase are there, but it's up to the
audience to figure it out. 

   Finally, I wanted there to be no wasted time in its six minute run-time. Credits are
unnecessary with a film this short. If someone is interested enough to want to know about the
cast and crew, they can either scroll down and read the video details, or click on the film's
Facebook or Twitter link. When I see short films that have 30 seconds or a minute of slow moving
credits to start, and nothing is really happening in the film, I guarantee they are losing
viewers.

*  What is the biggest mistake you’ve made as a film producer ? The biggest mistake I made
with Briefcase was that I actually lost the briefcase we were using the day before our last day
of shooting. It was a nightmare. It took me several weeks to track down an exact replica, and
more than anything, I felt like an idiot.

*  What are some of the shortcuts you’ve learned in filmmaking ? Some good ways of making it
easier on one-self as a writer and producer is to make the scenes and locations not too
complicated, and to be flexible. Sometimes my friends will send me their scripts, and they'll
have scenes that require tons of background actors or really tough-to-get locations. 

   Season 2 of Workshop had 130 co-star and guest star roles, and 100 locations, but I
specifically wrote the locations as places that wouldn't be impossible to get. 

   Sometimes I was flexible when a location fell through. One hard-to-get location in
Workshop Season 2 was when I had written two of the female leads being models at a car show, being
harassed by car show gawkers. I had locked down a car showroom at a car dealership, but the day
before we were supposed to shoot, the dealership backed out, and I was left scrambling. I ended
up tweaking the scene slightly so that the same scene took place, but in an underground parking
lot, where the actresses were getting out of their cars on their way to the car show. 

   With Briefcase , I made it easy on myself and only wrote four locations.

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dC8KgILBo7s/T3-eiqqpdWI/AAAAAAAAChQ/Aqh0I5mDA4o/s1600/Workshop-1.jpg
Audra Marie and Leanne Wilson of Workshop , in that parking lot. *  How do you find actors to
appear in your films ? Since I'm an actor, I am fortunate to know a ton of great actors in L.A.,
from the different acting classes I've taken, shows I've done, workshops I've taken, etc. If
you're in a smaller market city, Craigslist is a good place to start, and also whatever
colleges are in town. Hit up their drama departments. In bigger cities, there are various
actor sites that you can post auditions.

*  How do you find scripts to produce ? If I'm going to produce something, I like doing my own
projects first, before I look for other scripts. I work with a director and filmmaker all the
time on everything, Andre Welsh , and when he writes something, I produce and sometimes act in
his projects too. Andre directed Briefcase , both seasons of Workshop , and the pilot for my
other project I starred in back in early 2011, Generation U .

*  Do you have any t ips on fund-raising ? For fundraising, Kickstarter and IndieGogo are
great tools. I used Kickstarter to raise the money to shoot Workshop Season 2, and it also
helped raise awareness that I was going into production, etc., of the show.

*  What one book would you recommend to a young wannabe screenwriter in Adelaide ?  I would
recommend The Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers

Image:
http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=adelaidscreen-20&l=as2&o=1&a=193290736X by
Christopher Vogler . I found it immensely helpful not only as a writer, but as an actor as well.
It really teaches you about storytelling, and figuring out the characters and what they
represent inside the story.

*  Name your ten favourite movies of all time . Lawrence of Arabia (1962) Fight Club (1999) The
Game (1997) Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) The Sting (1973) Field of Dreams (1989)
Gattaca (1997) Point Break (1991) Shawshank Redemption   (1994) Snatch (2000)
