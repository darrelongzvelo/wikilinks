Jesus Won’t Make Your Life Perfect





Image: http://guatspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dscn1775.jpg?w=627&h=470

Do you think you have the perfect life?

Even though we are allÂ  masterpieces Â created by God, we’re broken. Â I don’t
think anyone can claim that they have the perfect life or that they’ve lived perfectly.
Â I think the majority of us would find that we have more in common withÂ  Aron Ralston
Â than Jesus.

On retreat down in Reu, Guatemala, after I gave my message on being broken, several students
came up to me and asked to talk. Â So we walked around under a grove a palm trees in the
sweltering heat and talked. Â They, like me, had made mistakes in their past. Â They,
like me, had felt stuck because of what they’d done and wished they could erase their
mistakes.

Jesus doesn’t erase our mistakes. Â He won’t make your life perfect. Â And we
shouldn’t want him too.



Image: http://guatspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dscn1816.jpg?w=627&h=470

As my students told me what had gone wrong in their lives, I felt God nudging me to tell them about
Aron Ralston. Â Now, if that name sounds familiar to you it’s because you just read my blog
from myÂ  27th birthday Â about being stuck in Guatemala and how God used that to get me to
where he wanted me. Â Or you saw the movie 127 Hours. Â But then maybe, you read Aron
Ralston’s book,Â  127 Hours: Between A Rock And A Hard Place .

Aron, an avid outdoorsman, found himself trapped by a freak climbing accident. Â He’d
survived being trapped in an avalanche and stalked by a bear, but when a large boulder
dislodged itself and pinned Aron’s arm to the side of Blue John Canyon in Utah, Aron’s life
had to change. Â After nearly six days of being trapped, Aron cut his arm off to free himself.

If anyone has reason to wish he could go back and have a past mistake taken away, it’s Aron.
Â He describes in the book how he had the opportunity to take another route through the
canyon, which would have kept him in contact with people, but he chose to remain alone. His
choice led to the loss of his arm. Â That is why I believe more of us relate to Aron than Jesus.

The Bible says that we all have messed up and fallen short of what it takes to make it into heaven.
Â We’ve all gotten our arms stuck between a rock and the canyon wall, with no real hope of
living life the way it was before we were trapped. Â I could tell, as I looked into my
student’s eyes, that they felt this desire.



Image: http://guatspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dscn1591.jpg?w=627&h=470

But then I shared with them the rest of Aron’s story.

After he’d cut his arm free and recovered in the hospital he wrote, “For all that has
happened and the opportunities still developing in my life, I feel blessed. Â I was part of a
miracle that has touched a great number of people in the world and I wouldn’t trade that for
anything, not even to have my hand back. Â My accident in the rescue from Blue John Canyon
were the most beautiful spiritual experiences of my life, knowing that, were I to travel back
in time, I would still say, ‘see you later’ to Megan and Kristi and take off into the lower
slot by myself,” (Ralston, pg 342). Â Because Aron cut his arm off so that he could live, he
inspired other people to fight to live.

Aron understands that God uses our pasts to help others. Â He gave Aron a greater story, one
not just about hiking and extreme sports, but about what it means to live and be connected to
God’s greater story.

This is Redemption. Â Aron is still missing his arm, it hasn’t grown back and he still has
the painful memory of the time inside the canyon.



Image: http://guatspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_0142.jpg?w=627&h=470

Our mistakes may seem simple when we place them next to Aron’s. Â But that doesn’t mean
they don’t matter to God. Â I was truly saddened as my students told me what had happened in
their lives over the last year. Â But, if we let God, He will redeem or pasts, He wont make our
lives perfect, but He will take what happened and use it to connect us to His greater purpose.

Redemption uses our imperfections.

Now, if you have been following myÂ  blog , you know that I have been talking about King David.
Â After committing adultery and then murdering to try to cover up his mistake, he realized
he needed to ask God to renew him and purify his heart. Â Because David opened his heart back
up to God and asked Him to redeem his life, David’s story doesn’t end with his mistake.
Â David’s story becomes part of God’s greater story, the story of Jesus.

If you look at Jesus’s family tree, its roots lead back to David and his mistake. Â God
doesn’t sweep away our past, but he does use it, if we let him, to make something beautiful.

Jesus didn’t come to bring us peace or to make our lives perfect. Â He came and died on the
cross to pay for our mistakes. Â And then he rose from the dead to mess up our lives. Â The
truth of the matter, that Jesus is alive, forces us to live differently. Â It connects us to
his story, and when we are part of his story our lives start to change. Â We start to have a
greater purpose.

As I sat there talking with my students, my hope was that they would start to let Jesus redeem
their mistakes. Â That they would realize the power for the resurrection, its ability to
give them a new story. Â A story with imperfections, with pain, and with hard times, but one
that is far more adventurous than anything they could’ve tried to live before.

As we finished retreat and I said goodbye to some of my favorite people in the entire world, I
hoped that God would connect them to a their true adventure. Â Like in Hugo, where at the end
of the movie, each character finds their purpose because they have let their past be redeemed
and have been connected to something greater than themselves. Â I know once we all start
living in the reality of theÂ  resurrection Â our lives will truly become an adventure.

A Playhouse Called Fear





Image:
http://bibleconversation.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/yellow-playhouse-porch.jpg?w=150&h=121
What would your life be like if you had no fear?

I asked myself that question a few years ago and discovered that a wound from my childhood had
affected me most of my life. For years, I thought anger was my central issue, but as I began to
peel back the layers, I discovered that at the core, it went much deeper.

When I was two or three years old, our family lived in a small town in rural Kansas. The house
across the street from us had a beautiful playhouse in the backyard.

One day, I was playing with the neighbor kids in the backyard across the street. Because I was
the youngest one in the pack, I was always a step or two slower than everyone else. Well, the
other kids huddled in a circle for a moment and then one of them said, â€œLetâ€™s go
play in the playhouse!â€� Everyone else ran inside and I followed behind.

After entering the playhouse, all of the kids ran out the entryway and slammed the door shut.
Then I heard someone lock the door on the outside.

I tried to open the door but it was fastened shut.



Image:
http://bibleconversation.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/023642.jpg?w=90&h=150

I didnâ€™t know what to do.

Then I looked to my left and saw a Mickey Mouse phone attached to the wall. I picked up the phone
and cried out to Mickey to save me. Unfortunately, Mickey didnâ€™t pick up.

Suddenly, I was overwhelmed with panic. What if I never get out of here? I thought. I felt so out
of control. Then something happened inside me that I distinctly remember to this day: like a
pilot light from a furnace, my anger was lit.

Obviously, I was eventually rescued, but the damage was already done.

From that point on, every time I felt like I was being controlled, that internal flame roared to
life and manifested itself as anger. As a child, when kids made fun of my new haircut and I
couldn’t make them stop, my anger burned out of control. For years, I felt like a volcano, the
red-hot lava simmering below the surface, building pressure until it released itself on any
unsuspecting person nearby. Usually, my wife and oldest daughter caught the overflow.

Finally, I came face-to-face with my anger issue. When confronted with my anger addiction I
decided to bring it to God.

He led me to a story from Mark 4:35-41. One evening, Jesus invited his disciples to join him in a
boat to cross the Sea of Galilee. Midway across the lake, a furious storm struck the boat,
nearly capsizing it. Jesus, however, was fast asleep in the stern.

Imagine going out in a boat, in the middle of the lake, in the middle of the night. No outboard
motorâ€”only sails and oars. No navigational equipment, not even a flashlight.

If one of those storms should hit, how would you feel?

The disciples shook Jesus awake. â€œJesus. Jesus! Teacher, donâ€™t you care that
weâ€™re about to drown?â€�

Then Jesus stood up and calmly said to the waves, â€œQuiet! Be still!â€� The wind
immediately died down and it became completely calm. Â Jesus looked at them and said,
â€œWhy are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?â€�

Astonished by what they had just seen, they asked each other, â€œWho is this? Even the wind
and the waves obey him!â€�

Studying this passage, I realized that Jesus is in control. Even when the waves are crashing
into me, even when I feel controlled by others, Jesus is still in controlâ€”and I have
nothing to fear.

I wish I could say it happened in an instant, but over time, the raging storm inside me began to
subside. I didnâ€™t need to be afraid. Jesus is in control.

    You may wrestle with an assortment of fears:

    - Fear of the unknown

    

    - Fear of being known, of people seeing the real you

    

    - Fear of being alone

    

    - Fear of being wrong

    

    - Fear of rejection

    

    - Fear of not being successful which is different than the fear of being un successful

    

    - Fear of failure

    

    - Fear of being average

    

    - Fear of unemployment

    

    - Fear of not being able to support your family

    

    - Fear of dying

    



Fear is such a powerful emotion that it can take godlike control over our lives, affecting our
relationships, the way we see ourselves, the way we make decisions, the way we see God.

Experience poverty growing up and you could respond by becoming a workaholic so that you never
have to go without again. Even if it means working a job you hate, a job that kills your heart. The
fear of poverty.

Fear of being alone can drive you into the arms of a person who doesnâ€™t love you, who may
be abusive, but is willing to provide a minimal amount of companionship.

We can lift up our voices in praise to Jesus on Palm Sunday and by the next Friday, fear can drive
us to crucify him on a cross.

We think that control brings peace, but it actually works in the opposite direction of peace.
In Isaiah 26:3, we read,Â ”You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you,
because he trusts in you”Â  (italics added).

Trust doesnâ€™t mean taking control, it means giving up control.

You can believe in your head that God is all-powerful, all-knowing, ultimately in control,
good, and loving. But in your heart, you just donâ€™t trust him.

The best answer I can give is the cross: â€œHe who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for
us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?â€� Romans 8:32 (ESV)

If God loves us enough to give us his son, then we can trust him.

And you don’t need to live in fear.

Michael co-pastorsÂ  The Neighborhood Church Â in Littleton, Colorado with Eugene
Scott. He’d like to say that he no longer deals with anger and control issues…but then
he’d be lying.

Blue Like Jazz: A Movie Review



By Eugene C. Scott



I wouldnâ€™t voluntarily see a â€œChristian movie.â€� Itâ€™s not that
they are cheesy. Thatâ€™s a cheap shot. Iâ€™ve seen my share of cheesy
â€œnon-Christian movies.â€� Rather, itâ€™s that movies produced by the
Christian faith community, which supposedly portray faith, and might produce faith, seldom
exhibit faith in Godâ€™s ability to communicate through a story well told. This usually
makes them lousy stories. And it’s ironic becauseÂ  Jesus fearlessly told stories: one
comparing God to an unjust judge .

Todayâ€™s Christian movie industry would never do such a thing for fear that some poor
sap like me might misunderstand the point. Therefore, Christian movies seldom tell
authentic, compelling stories because they are overly concerned with not offending popular
Christian orthodoxy, with getting Truth right, and with ensuring that the movie gets people
to heaven. For an example of this, readÂ  here Â Â for a discussion of whether the
characterÂ  “Penny” Â from “Blue Like Jazz” is Christian enough.

But I wanted to seeÂ  â€œBlue Like Jazzâ€� Â because I read theÂ  book
Â several years ago, and found it refreshing, not your typical
pastor-of-mega-church-preaches-sermon-and-turns-it-into-a-book book.Â  Donald
Miller Â is an excellent writer: poetic, funny, serious, irreverent, and honest in his
prose. Miller trusted me to get the point instead of impaling me with it. I hoped the movie would
follow suit. Plus Christianity Today said,Â  â€œ it’s hardly Christian cinema as
usual. â€�

So, though I had trouble imagining Millerâ€™s series of â€œnonreligious thoughts
on Christian spiritualityâ€� being turned into a complete story, I donned my disguise
and trooped off to see â€œBlue Like Jazzâ€� (I always wear a disguise when going to
Christian movies or book stores in case someone recognizes me.Â  Just kidding, sort of).

Eugene heading for his local Christian bookstore

The movie is the story of a fictional 19 year-old Donald Miller, who begins to feel his
Bible-belt is cinched a bit too tight. â€œDon,â€� played dryly but authentically
byÂ  Marshall Allman , has been accepted into a Christian college.Â The scene depicting
his â€œgraduationâ€� at church is as intentionally uncomfortable as any
Iâ€™ve sat through. Exaggerated but too close to home.Â Unknown to Don, his
estranged–and strange–jazz-loving father enrolls him in uber-liberal Reed College in
Portland. He rejects the idea as crazy until his mother inadvertently jerks his magic-carpet
faith completely out from under him.

The rest of the film shows Don struggling to figure out who he now is, if he is not some caraciture
of a flannel-board Christ. Donâ€™s struggle is real and funny. I have not traveled
Donâ€™s path, but I did during the movie and I wanted his conflict and disappointment and
loneliness to shape him into the person I read about in the book.

The writing is sharp, bouncing from Seinfeld-like irony to true soul searching. The scene
where Don is sitting on a bench, alone, writing in his journal was powerful story-telling.
More-so, when a friend from Houston unexpectedly shows up at Reed over Christmas break.

DirectorÂ  Steve Taylor Â filled Millerâ€™s college life with quirky, troubled,
and extremely intelligent fellow travelers. The movie claims the average IQ score at Reed
College is a couple above genius. I have to admit, for several reasons, I may not have survived
at Reed. It looked to me like flypaper for the world’s wildest and weirdest. But Reed made for
a perfect setting for Miller’s journey.

Blue Like Jazz was not “Christian” nor cheesy. I enjoyed it. I laughed, cringed, hoped,
and was lost in the characters and the story most of the time.

A couple of exceptions:

The animated car scene where Don drives from Texas to Portland is silly, even cheesy (but not
â€œChristian cheesyâ€�). I found myself taken out of the story then and it took me a
few minutes to dive back in. I wish Taylor had spent that valuable screen time letting Allman
develop Miller more deeply.

Too bad Taylor didnâ€™t have more money so the cinematography and technical aspects
would match the writing and over-all story. Even then it is well done on all levels.

Also, despite Taylorâ€™s success in letting the story speak for itself, there were a
couple of scenes that seemed built to communicate information rather than show Donâ€™s
struggle. But this was not often.

Over-all, however, â€œBlue Like Jazzâ€� is a well-told, thoughtful, provocative
story about a young man digging below his facade of safe, American consumer-driven religion
to see if there is a real, living, breathing God buried there. That story is one, according to
sociologistÂ  Christian Smith , many in fictional Donald Millerâ€™s age group are
living.

Itâ€™s a movie to be enjoyed and discussed. What did you think?

Eugene C. Scott is co-pastor ofÂ  The Neighborhood Church . He tried to sound a lot like an
official movie critic in this review because he grew up reading the reviews in TV Guide and
itâ€™s always been a dream of his to become a crusty media critic. Besides after ranting
about Christian movies and book stores, he might need a back-up career.

Are You Broken?





Image: http://guatspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dscn1193.jpg?w=627&h=836

God made me into a masterpiece. Â And yet, like the broken volcanic rock I’m standing on in
this picture, I’m a broken masterpiece.

I’m a broken masterpiece who’s enamored with a kids movie. Â WhenÂ  Hugo Â came
out before Christmas I was blown away by its beauty, but as I’ve watched it again and again,
I’ve seen the true elements of God’s grace and redemption weave their way through the
story.

In the movie, Hugo Cabret, the main character, loves fixing things. Â As the story
progresses he realizes that everyone around him is broken. Just as Hugo realized that the
people around him were inventions who needed fixed, I realized that fact is true to life.
Â We are all creations who have been broken.



Image: http://guatspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dscn1881.jpg?w=627&h=470

I’ve been writing a lot about my recent mission trip to Guatemala. Â During the first part
of March 2012 I led a small team down to Xela (Quetzaltenango), Guatemala to help out with a
vacation Bible school program and a high school and middle school retreat.

Now, if you have been following my blog you know that the week was quite anÂ  adventure .
Â You also know that you areÂ  God’s masterpiece . Â You know that God created you for
a reason.

But what happens when you mess up. Â When you feel broken. Does God just toss us away? Â Can
we mess up so bad that even God wont take us back?



Image: http://guatspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dscn1828.jpg?w=627&h=470

During the retreat, once we’d made it down to hotter than hell Reu, Guatemala, I asked my
students if they knew what the word redemption meant. Â We were packed into a small dining
hall for games, worship, and a message. Â Going along with the theme of creation I asked
three boys to create something with Hot Tamales. Â First they had to chew them up and then
build something artistic.



Image: http://guatspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dscn1633.jpg?w=627&h=470

The game failed. Â I’m pretty sure all of the students were bored during the game, which
wasn’t how I pictured it. Â I’m glad it was just a game. Â But then, somehow the games
failure fit into my talk. Â How often do our lives not go as planned. Â If we are inventions
we sure tend to break down a lot, and sometimes it’s our own fault.

In my last blog I talked about how God chose a little shepherd to be king of Israel. Â David was
the smallest in his family, but he had something God desired. Â An open heart. Â But let me
tell you the rest of David’s story. Â If he was a man after God’s own heart, he was also
horribly broken. Â Once David becomes king he stops following God’s plan for him.

If I think I’ve messed up, well at least I haven’t skipped out on God’s job for me so that I
could commit adultery. Â David did that. Â But wait, there’s more. Â David finds
out he knocked up the woman he slept with, and wait, she’s married. Â So, after he tries to
pin the baby on her husband, which fails miserably, (as is what happens most of the time when we
try to hide our mistakes) David has the man killed. Â So, David has gone from a man after
God’s own heart, to an adulterer, to a murderer. Â I am sure when he woke up the morning
before all this happened, he didn’t write on his to do list, sleep with a married woman and
then kill her husband.

No. Â We never plan on making mistakes. Â As I shared this story of David with my students,
I wanted them to realize that even great biblical figures mess up. If someone in the Bible
screws up royally, then what does that mean for us normal folk?

And so I opened my Bible and shared with them how David responded to Â God. Â Yes, at first
David hid from God, tried to cover up all his wrong doing, but then he does something us normal
folk should do. Â He admits his wrongs and asks God to redeem him. Â InÂ  Psalm 51 verse
1-12 Â David writes:

1 Â Have mercy on me, O God,



Image: http://guatspot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dscn2034.jpg?w=300&h=225

according to your unfailing love;

according to your great compassion

blot out my transgressions.

2 Â Wash away all my iniquity

and cleanse me from my sin.

3 Â For I know my transgressions,

and my sin is always before me.

4 Â Against you, you only, have I sinned

and done what is evil in your sight;

so you are right in your verdict

and justified when you judge.

5 Â Surely I was sinful at birth,

sinful from the time my mother conceived me.

6 Â Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb;

you taught me wisdom in that secret place.

7 Â Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;

wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.

8 Â Let me hear joy and gladness;

let the bones you have crushed rejoice.

9 Â Hide your face from my sins

and blot out all my iniquity.

10 Â Create in me a pure heart, O God,

and renew a steadfast spirit within me.

11 Â Do not cast me from your presence

or take your Holy Spirit from me.

12 Â Restore to me the joy of your salvation

and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.

David was a broken invention. Â God set him on a path to be king of Israel and David messes
things up. Â We are God’s masterpieces, but if you are like me you have messed up. Â The
first step to redemption is admitting to God how you messed up.

I have found that when I am open with my faults God tends to redeem them. Redemption doesn’t
mean erasing all that we did wrong, but fixing what is broken. Â Like David said, create in me
a pure heart and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Â He didn’t say take this all away as if
it never happened, he asked for God to fix him.

That is exactly what God did on Easter through Jesus. Â He sent Jesus to fix us. Â But that
can only happen if we admit that we’re broken and need someone to repair us. Â If we do, our
story will be as meaningful as Hugo’s, probably even more so. Â Because when we are living
out God’s plan for us our stories turn into grand adventures.



As I finished giving my message I prayed that each of the students would keep their heart open to
God and know that, no matter what they’d done or will do, they could never separate
themselves from God.

I hope you know that too. Â I urge you to join me, and my dad,Â  Eugene Scott , inÂ  Living
Spiritually . Â We have set this year and hopefully our lives to keeping our eyes and our
hearts open to God. Â It has been an adventure so far and it would be amazing if you joined us.

Are You Name-Dropping Jesus?





Image:
http://bibleconversation.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/wwjd.jpeg?w=150&h=112

In the late 1960s through the 1970s, Andre Crouch was the king of Gospel music. While racial
tensions were high during those turbulent times, Andre traversed the boundaries with ease.
Musicians who either worked with Crouch or performed with him included Elvis Presley, Billy
Preston, Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, and Michael Jackson.

In the mid-1980s, a woman at my church announced she was engaged to Andre. She reserved our
church building, asked my senior pastor to officiate, sent out invitations, and excitedly
shopped for dresses with her bridesmaids. Because Andre was such a high profile personality
with a busy schedule, she told the pastor that he would show up in time for the ceremony.

On the day of the wedding, family and friends packed the church sanctuary, anticipating a
glorious event. The bridesmaids doted on the cheery bride.

And they waited for Andre to arrive.

They waited and waited while the congregation grew increasingly agitated and concerned.

Finally, my senior pastor met with the bride privately.

â€œDo you have any idea where Andre might be?â€�

â€œI have no idea,â€� she responded. â€œThatâ€™s just not like
him.â€�

Unfortunately, the bride didnâ€™t have Andreâ€™s phone number with her, so the
pastor decided to do a little investigative work on his own. Finally, he was able to locate his
phone number (this pastor was very well-connected!). So he dialed the number.

â€œHello?â€�

â€œYes, is this Andre Crouch?â€�

â€œYes it is.â€�

â€œThis is Charles Blair and I pastor a church in Denver, Colorado. A woman in my
congregation asked me to perform her wedding ceremony this afternoon, and youâ€™re the
man sheâ€™s supposed to be marrying. Do you know [womanâ€™s name]?â€�

â€œPastor,â€� Andre replied. â€œI don’t know who youâ€™re talking
about. I donâ€™t know that woman nor have I ever heard of her in my life.â€�

The woman, with obvious mental health issues, was all dressed up with no place to go.

That true story has haunted me for nearly thirty years. The troubled woman was name-dropping a
person who didnâ€™t know her. She talked a good game. She looked the part. But in the end,
Andre Crouch never knew her.

Are You Name-Dropping Jesus?



In Matthew 7, Jesus describes the day of judgment when seemingly godly people stand before
him. â€œLord, in your name we prophesied, we cast out demons, and performed many
miracles. Surely thatâ€™s enough.â€�

But Jesus replies, â€œI never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!â€� (see
Matthew 7:22-23)

You can hang a cross around your neck, wear a WWJD bracelet, go to church (when it fits your
schedule!), be a good citizen and vote in every election, even throw some change in the
offering–but if you donâ€™t know Jesus, then you’re nothing more than a
name-dropper. A poser.

In the verse immediately preceding this passage, Jesus says, â€œNot everyone who says to
me, â€˜Lord, Lord,â€™ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the
will of my Father who is in heaven.â€� This passage points to three truths:

Doing good deeds isnâ€™t enough. Prophesying, casting out demons, and performing
miracles required the power of God. At a minimum, these people were trying to help people. But
they fell short.

Doing good deeds cannot be equated with doing the will of God. Obviously, according to Jesus,
theyâ€™re different.

Knowing Jesus and doing Godâ€™s will go together. Neither survives alone, but it begins
with knowing God.

A common ailment among many believers is what I call â€œvirtual Christianity.â€�
We talk so much about something that we convince ourselves weâ€™re doing it. We do it with
prayer, giving, community, etc.

We also do it in our relationship with Jesus.

Donâ€™t just talk about Jesus. Know him.

Lent is Over. Now What?





Image: http://ecscott.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/images.jpeg?w=259&h=194 During
the last 60,480 minutes Iâ€™ve missed a few things. Thatâ€™s 1,008 hours for those
of you not handy with math. Forty-two days. Thatâ€™s how long I gave up TV and radio for
Lent. Now several days after Easter, the day Lenten fast’s finish, Iâ€™m wondering if
I really missed anything.

Sure, news happened, even important news. But did I really miss anything?

RickÂ  Santorum suspended his presidential campaign . NewsmanÂ  Mike Wallace , banjo
virtuosoÂ  Earl Scruggs , and painterÂ  Thomas KincadeÂ  all passed. These were great
losses. Looming less large, so did Scottish champion darts player,Â  Jocky Wilson Â and
probowlerÂ  LaVerne Carter .

Also during Lent,Â  Madonna was banned from a talk show,Â  Lindsay Lohan was released
from probation andÂ  given a warning by a judge , andÂ  Ninjas attacked a medical
marijuana delivery man .

Depending on your point of view, I may or may not have missed anything.

Sacrifice is always dangerous. Itâ€™s an act of release, opening oneself up,
vulnerability. When you give something up or away, you always stand the chance of ending up
empty-handed or, worse, hurt. Thatâ€™s also why sacrifice is powerful.

But often in taking a risk, we discover that our sacrifice also makes room in life for something
new. Thatâ€™s why, in my opinion, I donâ€™t think I missed anything in my
self-imposed media ban.

I gained.

Freedom.

My daily thoughts have not been held captive by the commercially driven yammering of some
talking head or disembodied voice. Iâ€™ve not spent one moment worrying about who the
next President of the U.S. might be (though I will inform myself and vote), whether it might
rain on my parade that day or not, or what the insane governments in Iran and North Korea might
do.



Image: http://ecscott.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_1440.jpg?w=300&h=225

My mind has been free to notice life and people near and around me. Iâ€™ve taken more
pictures, seen spring fight off the blandness of winter, and my voice memo function on my
iPhone is full of ideas for sermons, books, articles, and blogs. Iâ€™ve rediscovered
music. I feel wildly creative. I started writing poetry again.Â  And Iâ€™m
partnering with gifted musician,Â  Cliff Hutchison , in writing song lyrics. Iâ€™ve
prayed for my friends and family more consistently as God brings their names and faces to mind
in the absence of media noise.

I gained.

Time.

I simply donâ€™t feel as rushed. Standing in my living room as night closes down the day,
Iâ€™ve often asked myself what I should do next.Â  Itâ€™s a wonderful, languid
feeling. Usually Iâ€™d be vegging in front of the TV. Iâ€™ve taken longer walks
with Dee Dee, my wife, and had spontaneous conversations with her. Gone to bed earlier. I have
time to write my novel and Iâ€™ve read around seven books. Leif Engerâ€™s novel
â€œ So Brave, Young, and Handsome â€� gets better each time I read it. Iâ€™ve
journaled almost everyday of 2012.

Iâ€™m gaining.

Insight.

Itâ€™s not been all sweetness and light, however. This Lenten silence has allowed me to
recognize who I am and who Iâ€™m not. I, maybe like you, am a pretty flawed person. The
noise of TV and radio often allowed me to cover that fact. My journals are just as full of
inanities, complaints, and judgements as they are prayers, poems, and pretty prose. And some
things have only shifted. Instead of carrying on an imaginary debate with some TV
commentator, I now do so with a Facebook friend. Argh.

The ancient but honest theologian and philosopher, Paul of Tarsus, expressed it this
way,Â  â€œI do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I
do.â€�Â 

Lent’s Over. Now What?



Image: http://ecscott.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_1436.jpg?w=300&h=225

Still Iâ€™m not willing to give the reins of even my messy life back to some advertising
executive pulling levers behind a curtain. Monday I watched, or rather slept through, the
Colorado Rockiesâ€™ home opener. But, Iâ€™m not going back. Yet. Iâ€™ve
gained too much to gorge myself on media again. The silence has been exceedingly rich and
Iâ€™ve seen living spiritually–for me–cannot happen in a world dominated by media
noise.

After Â 60,480 minutes I’ve found I missed nothing. Rather I gained–even if the
mostÂ disconcerting as well as comforting truth is that I cannot live spiritually, become
a better person, on my own. I must agree with Paul again. â€œThanks be to God, who delivers
me through Jesus Christ our Lord!â€�

Just Another Easter



Image:
http://bibleconversation.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/easter.jpg?w=300&h=300

The Gallups in pastels for Easter

So that was fun.

I’m sure many of your found the courage to wear pastel colors that normally lie dormant in you
closet the rest of the year yesterday. Perhaps you got together with family members you would
never spend time with unless you had to. You may have eaten a few too many peeps than the
recommended serving size. But even if you did none of these, chances are you went to church.
Even if yesterday was the only day of the year that you do.

I’m normally a rather sentimental fellow. I cried when I watched Charlotte’s Web; and
when I say cried, I mean I sobbed and snot poured out of ny nose and I didn’tÂ care because I
was so enraptured in the beauty of the moment. Yeh, I’m one of those. So usually every year
around the beginning of Spring, I find myself knee-deep in snot and tears as I become
overwhelmed by sheer beauty of the Easter story.

The whole thing is beautiful even if it isn’t personal, but it is. In no way am I worthy of such
beauty, such grace, such love, such life. Yet the story of Easter is just about that, the
meeting of our complete unworthiness with God’s complete welcome. When the weight of my
folly intersects with the glory of God’s love, tears are paltry offerings to express the
beauty of redemption.

But this year my eyes stayed dry. I wore my pastel pants, ate candy, went to church, sang about
joy, and went to lunch like nothing different happened. I had to ask myself why.

Maybe because like our linen pants and pink ties, we rummage through the closet to find this
thing called to Resurrection and pull it out for one day to show it off only to have it stored away
till next year. The Resurrection is the climax of the gospel, the story of Jesus. Without it, we
have no hope, we have no faith, we have no life. It completes the work of the cross and ushers in a
New Creation that is bursting forth light where darkness once reigned. It is at the very center
of our faith as Christians, yet for many of us it has already become an afterthought today.

The reality of the Resurrection is that it is not just an event that happened butÂ it is
always happening, especially right now. Our hope is that we too participate in the
Resurrection through our faith and obedience in Christ. The intersection of our depravity
and God’s love is our daily reality. Yet when we think that one day a year is good enough, we are
in effect denying the Resurrection.

When we regulate the power of God to some children’s story that only matters peripherally at
best, we deny that the tomb is empty. We deny that Jesus truly reigns in our hearts and in our
world. This year I saw aÂ spectacleÂ of false joy. I was immersed in a group of people who
had traded the truth of Easter for a lie. Because really nothing changed. We put on fake smile to
match our shoes and tread upon the gravity of this story.

I may seem a little heavy-handed but I felt the weight of our hypocrisy most clearly yesterday.
Instead of shedding tears of joy, I shed tears of sorrow. As my brothers and sisters gave lip
service to “He is risen indeed” I wanted to shake them and plead, “do you really believe
this?” Because if we did…..I’m not really sure what would happen if we really did.

But here is the power of Easter. The sins of our ignorance, the depravity of our hypocrisy is not
met with God’s scorn but with his grace.

If the Resurrection is real then I can hope and rejoice that the life that seemed so distant in
the very hearts it was professed to belong to, can (and I believe will) find its home there once
again, perhaps even for the first time. The implication of Easter is that we can again cry tears
of joy in the face of our hypocrisy because Jesus laid death in its grave.

I did not cry yesterdayÂ becauseÂ I was also part of the denying crowd.

Because my vision was filled solely with our collective hypocrisy, I missed the intersection
of grace altogether. I saw our depravity asÂ victoriousÂ and that is the very lie the
Resurrection destroys. Jesus overcame the grave so that Love canÂ trulyÂ win.

Do I reallyÂ believeÂ this? Because if I did…..
