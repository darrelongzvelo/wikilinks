Hillary Channeling Eleanor Roosevelt?! She Picked the WRONG Roosevelt!



Having enjoyed my visit to TR's spartan vacation home, Pine Knot, in Albemarle county in
September, I wanted to explore the life of Alice Roosevelt * first born of Theodore and his
first wife, Alice Lee.

Alice Roosevelt's birth caused the death of her mother * the love of TR's life * which caused
Theodore's journey to into the Badlands for 3+ years.  During this time, Alice was raised by
TR's sister, Anna/Bye for the early years of her life.



Image: http://www.mentalfloss.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/alice.jpg





The TR side of the Roosevelt family was known as the Oyster Bay Roosevelts as they were 5
generations removed from the ORIGINAL Roosevelts and the Eleanor/Franklin side of the same
family known as the Hyde Park Roosevelts.

Alice was reunited with her father when he married Edith and resided with her step-mother and
father through his political career which did not end in the White House.

Eleanor was the daughter of TR's alcoholic brother, Elliott, and she married her 5th cousin,
Franklin, and UNITED the Oyster Bay and Hyde Park sides of the family.

Alice, although never formally educated,was a beauty from her mother genes and was a great
reader and studied the politics of her day.  She was her father's envoy through-out his
presidency and traveled to the Orient, Europe and Africa on his behalf.  She was married
while TR was still in the White House to OH Congressman Nick Longworth * a decade older than she
was and an admitted aldulterer.

Alice was an heiress in her own right from mother's Lee relatives.  Eleanor, on the other
hand, had little family funds and depended on the charity of generous relatives for her
upbringing after her father died when she was 5 years old.

Both Alice and Eleanor married men who DIED with their mistresses and without them.  During
her marriage to Nick Longworth, Alice got pregnant by Idaho Senator Bill Borah * the then GOP
leader in the Senate.  Her husband attained the level of Speaker of the House and was a sitting
member of congress at his death.

Alice's DC residence was the SALON for politics, foreign policy and new ideas in the early
1900s.  When Democrats Eleanor and Franklin occupied the White House, Eleanor suffered
from her comparison to Alice's beauty, wit, charm.  The public loved her and felt they had
known her all of her life which they had.  

Eleanor, when First Lady,  took pains to slight Alice by leaving her out of presidential
events; however, Franklin realized Alice's popularity and wanted to use the "family
connection" to appear mollify the GOP members of congress where she continued to be active
after her husband's death.

After her husband's death, Alice continued to have her likeness used in commercials for
soaps, tobacco and she wrote newspaper columns and political and social commentary until her
death in the 1980s when she was in her 90s.

Proving her popularity, Alice had a COLOR, a song and a Broadway musical named after her.

Alice blue  is a pale  tint  of  azure  that was favored by  Alice Roosevelt Longworth ,
daughter of  Theodore Roosevelt  and which sparked a fashion sensation in the  United
States .

The hit song "Alice Blue Gown", inspired by Longworth's signature gown, premiered in the 1919
Broadway musical  Irene . The musical was made into  a film  in  1940  starring  Anna
Neagle  and  Ray Milland .

The color is specified by the  United States Navy  for use in  insignia  and trim on
vessels named for Theodore Roosevelt. [ citation needed ]  "AliceBlue" is also one of the
original 1987  X11 color names  which became the basis for color description in  web
 authoring. The name "Alice Blue" was trademarked in 2001 by a costume company called "Alice
Blue Fancy Dress & Costume" in the U.K. but the livery color chosen by them was not the correct
Alice Blue shade, but instead a rich royal blue.

Wallace - This is a great history leason and enjoyable to all readers especially myself.
Wonderful history lesson, and a little bit of soap opera politics in the last century.

EVERYBODY knew it was doubtful Alice's daughter was by her husband.  The daughter, Paulina
Longworth Sturm, died in the late 50s and Alice raised her granddaughter. Wallace S. Gibson

Monday is my Happiness Day.

I visit as many blog posts as I can during the day

and spread happiness, which means I probably didn’t read this post.

I just stopped by to spread some happiness.

Feel free to delete this comment if it doesn’t make you happy.
