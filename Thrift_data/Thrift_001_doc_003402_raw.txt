orchid flowers

I will assume that your plants are healthy with lots of new leafy green growths and good roots.
If you don't have a healthy plant, don't expect it to flower! If you're not getting blooms AND
your plants are healthy, read on.

Here are the main reasons orchid will not bloom and what you can do about it. One or more reasons
may apply to your orchid plants:

#1. GIVE YOUR ORCHIDS ENOUGH LIGHT     

Most flowering house plants, orchids included, will  not bloom if they are not getting
enough light.  This is generally the main reason that orchids do not bloom . Northern
exposure is usually not sufficient. A bright western, slightly shaded in the hottest months,
or eastern exposure work well.  A southern exposure gives you the greatest flexibility. If
your window is heavily shaded by trees or adjacent buildings, this will reduce light to your
plants and you will have to make adjustments accordingly. If you have bright indirect light,
your phals and paphs should do fine.  Oncidiums generally need slightly brighter light.
Dendrobiums and Cattleyas need the brightest light of all, and do best in a Southern
exposure.  Find out more about  light requirements for growing orchids indoors

Skylights, unless you live in Arizona, or unless they are about five feet above the plants
generally do not provide sufficient light, for all but the most shade-loving of orchids. 
Please don't email me and tell me your orchids do fine under your skylight-perhaps they do but I
need to make some broad generalizations here ;) 

Remember also that while a few paltry blooms on an orchid may be   nice   , our goal here is to get
our orchids to put on a good show,  and to make your investment of time and money worthwhile. 
How do you know if your plants are getting enough light? As a general rule look at the foliage. It
should be a light grassy green. Lush dark green foliage is nice to look at, but it means your
plants are not getting enough light. Leaves should also be turgid and firm on phals,
cattleyas, and dendrobiums. Mottled leaved paphs should show good color contrast   on the
leaves- see our  paphiopedilum culture page for more details.  

    If your plants are not getting enough light move them closer to the window. Yes, even a foot
    can make a huge difference as light falls off very rapidly within increasing distance
    from a window.  During the summer months place plants outdoors in dappled shade if you
    can.  Whenever you move plants into brighter conditions always do so very gradually as
    you risk burning the leaves.  Lastly, remember to only grow plants suited to your
    conditions to avoid disappointment. I just saw some beautiful vandas in bloom at the
    grocery store! Vandas are very difficult to grow in the home and sadly most will end up in
    the trash heap.  Tweet

Green: Distribution of  Vanilla  species



Vanilla , the  v anilla orchids , form a  flowering plant   genus  of about 110  species
 in the orchid family ( Orchidaceae ). The most widely known member is the  Flat-leaved
Vanilla  ( V. planifolia ), from which commercial  vanilla  flavoring is derived. It is
the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes (in the food industry and in the cosmetic
industry). Another species often grown commercially but not on an industrial scale is the 
Pompona Vanilla  ( V. pompona ).

This evergreen genus occurs worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, from tropical
America to tropical Asia, New Guinea and West Africa. It was known to the  Aztecs  for its
flavoring qualities. The genus was established in 1754 by Plumier, based on J. Miller. The
name came from the  Spanish  word "vainilla", diminutive form of "vaina" (meaning " sheath
"), which is in turn derived from  Latin  " vagina ".

Flat-leaved Vanilla  ( Vanilla planifolia ) habitus

This genus of  vine -like plants has a  monopodial  climbing  habitus . They can form long
thin stems with a length of more than 35 m, with alternate  leaves  spread along their
length. The short, oblong, dark green leaves of  Vanilla  are thick and leathery, even
fleshy in some species. But there are also a significant number of species that have their
leaves reduced to  scales  or have become nearly or totally leafless and appear to use their
green climbing stems for photosynthesis . Long and strong  aerial roots  grow from each
node.

The  racemose   inflorescences  short-lived  flowers  arise successively on short 
peduncles  from the leaf axils or scales. There may be up to 100 flowers on a single raceme, but
usually no more than 20. The flowers are quite large and attractive with white, green,
greenish yellow or cream colors. The flowers'  sepals  and  petals  are similar. The 
lip  is tubular-shaped and surrounds the long, bristly  column , opening up, as the bell of a
trumpet, at its apex. The  anther  is at the top of the column and hangs over the  stigma ,
separated by the rostellum. Most  Vanilla  flowers have a sweet scent.

Blooming occurs only when the flowers are fully grown. Each flower opens up in the morning and
closes late in the afternoon on the same day, never to re-open. If  pollination  has not
occurred meanwhile, it will be shed. The flowers are self-fertile but need pollinators to
perform this task. The flowers are presumed to be pollinated by  stingless bees  (e.g. 
Melipona ) and certain  hummingbirds , which visit the flowers primarily for  nectar .
But  hand pollination  is the most reliable method in commercially grown  Vanilla .

The fruit is termed  "vanilla bean" , though true  beans  are  fabaceaen   eudicots
 not at all closely related to orchids. Rather, the vanilla fruit is technically an
elongate, fleshy and later  dehiscent   capsule  10-20 cm long. It ripens gradually for
8 to 9 months after flowering, eventually turning black in color and giving off a strong aroma.
Each pod contains thousands of minute  seeds , but it is the pod that is used to create vanilla
flavoring.

Vanilla  species are used as food plants by the  larvae  of some  Lepidoptera  species,
such as the  wooly bear moths   Hypercompe eridanus  and  H. icasia .  Vanilla
plantations require some sort of tree planting for the orchids to climb up on; off-season or
when abandoned, they may serve as habitat for animals of open forest, e.g. on the  Comoros
 for  Robert Mertens' Day Gecko  ( Phelsuma robertmertensi ).

[ edit ] Description



The generic name means "Phalaen[a]-like" and is probably a reference to the genus  Phalaena
, the name given by Carolus Linnaeus  to a group of large moths; the flowers of some species
supposedly resemble  moths  in flight. For this reason, the species are sometimes
called  Moth orchids .

They are native throughout southeast  Asia  from the  Himalayan  mountains to the
islands of  Polillo ,  Palawan  and Zamboanga del Norte  in the island of  Mindanao  in
the  Philippines  and northern  Australia .  Orchid Island  of  Taiwan  is named
after this genus. Little recent information about their habitat and their ecology in nature
is available since little field research has been done in the last decades.

Phalaenopsis aphrodite  (Moon Orchid)

Most are  epiphytic  shade plants; a few are  lithophytes . In the wild, some species grow
below the canopies of moist and humid lowland forests, protected against direct sunlight;
others grow in seasonally dry or cool environments. The species have adapted individually to
these three habitats.

Possessing neither  pseudobulbs  nor  rhizome ,  Phalaenopsis  shows a  monopodial
 growth habit: an erect growing  stem  produces one or two alternate, thick, fleshy,
elliptical  leaves  a year from the top while the older, basal leaves drop off at the same
rate. If very healthy, a Phalaenopsis  plant can have up to ten or more leaves. The
inflorescence , either a  raceme  or  panicle , appears from the  stem between the
leaves. They bloom in their full glory for several weeks. If kept in the home, the flowers may
last two to three months.

Some  Phalaenopsis  species in  Malaysia  are known to use subtle weather cues to
coordinate mass flowering.

P. Sogo Yukidian

    The species can be classified into two groups :

    - A group with a long, branched  inflorescence  (up to 1 m long) and large, almost round
    flowers with rose or white tints.

    

    - A group with short stems and less rounded, waxy flowers with more pronounced colors.

    



In terms of Raunkiær plant lifeform terminology, these plants are  epiphytes .

Based on DNA-evidence, the genera  Doritis  Lindl. and  Kingidium  P.F.Hunt are now
included in  Phalaenopsis , according to the World Checklist of Monocotyledons, Royal
Botanical Gardens, Kew) (See also ref 1). However not every specialist in this field accepts
these taxonomic changes.

Intensive cross-fertilization has produced a great number of  hybrids  in all colors and
variations. These are usually more adaptable to artificial conditions than their botanical
ancestors. Many are hybrids of  Phalaenopsis amabilis , Phalaenopsis schilleriana  or 
Phalaenopsis stuartiana .

10 Common Orchid Types



All About the 10 Most Common Orchid Species



Below you’ll find information about the most common orchids. As you’ll see from the
beautiful pictures there’s a reason why they’re so popular…enjoy.





 



Phalaenopsis



Image:
http://www.allaboutorchidcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Phalaenopsis.jpg

Photo provided by Abhradeep Kundu A very popular orchid owing to the ease that they flower and
propagate in a home environment.

They come in a variety of colours and shades but are typically identified by their long stems,
bunches of flowers and thick green leaves at the base of the stem.





 



Cymbidium

Image:
http://www.allaboutorchidcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Cymbidium.jpg

Photo provided by http://www.noodlesnacks.com/ The Cymbidium or boat orchid, was first
described by Olof Swartz in 1799. It derives its name from the Greek word for cavity, kumbos,
referring to the growth at the base of the lip.

In Bhutan they can be found flavouring a spicy curry called “olatshe”.

They typically have more leaves than many orchids and come in huge variety of colors with
flowers which last about ten weeks.





 



Paphiopedilum (Lady Slipper orchid)

Image:
http://www.allaboutorchidcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Paphiopedilum_Lady_Slipper.jpg

Photo provided by Dalton Holland Baptista The paphiopedilums is commonly hybridized due to
its beautiful, if not bizzare flowers.

New specias of this orchid are still being discovered occasionally but none so far can rival
the beauty of the Golden Slipper Orchid discovered in 1979.

Providing their natural environment is roughly emulated in the home they are relatively easy
to grow and most thrive in temperatures ranging from 55 – 95 oF with 55 – 70% humidity.

Many hybrids have been bred to be easier to grow indoors.





 



Vanilla

Photo provided by the National Park Service The Vanilla orchid can be found across the world in
most tropical regions and is an evergreen flower most notably known for its flavoring
qualities.

Also part of the vine family, they can extend up to 35 meters in length with short dark green
vanilla leaves.

Each cluster can contain up to 100 flowers however it is more likely to be around 20.

Flowers open in the morning and close in the evening and sadly never re-open again.





 



Oncidium

provides the origin of its name from the Greek work ‘onkos’ meaning swelling.Most are
epiphytes and can be found in the Americas from Florida down to South America.

 

The flowers come in shades of red, yellow, pink and white with frilly edges and a huge lip. They
are known as ‘spray orchids’ on account of how their branches ‘spray out’.





 



Laelia

Photo provided by JoJan Found largely subtropical Central America – mainly Mexico. They
have diverse growing conditions, some prefering sunny dry,cool conditions while others
prefer more rainforest like conditions – warm and humid.

Most are epiphytes and are closely related to the Cattleya (see below).

Their stems are usually short and flowers are pink/purple with a purple lip; rare albino
varieties are prized.

They blossom in spring or autumn.

There is a high demand for rare varieties which are artificially cultured in horticultural
labs.





 



Epidendrum

Photo provided by Maarten Sepp Found on the American continents in tropical and subtropical
regions, this orchid is extremely varied in the environment it grows and in its appearance. 
From jungles to cloud forests this epiphyte can be found between altitudes of 1,000 to 3,000m.

Flowers vary in size, typically small to medium in size, but tend to grow in ‘tufts’.

Many species are extraordinarily fragrant.





 



Cattleya

Photo provided by Cássio van den Berg The Cattleya orchid containing around 115 species are
predominantly known for their large, showy flowers.

Flowers are range in size from 5cm to 15cm and occur in almost every color except for true blue
and black

Because Cattleya flowers are so beautiful they are one of the most hybridized varieties and
both the quality and quantity of hybrids has increased in recent years.

the Bulbophyllum can now be found in Australia, South East Asia, India, Africa, Madagascar
and South America.

Flowers emanate from stems either in a spiral or ranks and the petals are often callous and
hairy.

New species are being discovered every year.





 



Miltonia

Slaty Leek Orchid - profile



Scientific name:   Prasophyllum fuscum 

  Conservation status in NSW:  Critically Endangered

National conservation status:   Vulnerable

Description



An orchid to 45 cm tall with a single leaf to 40 cm long. Inflorescences have 10-30 moderately
crowded flowers, which are greenish brown to reddish brown, and lightly scented. Dorsal
sepals are up to 9.5 mm long and pointed. Lateral sepals are free and up to 10 mm long and are
recurved, parallel, pointed. Petals are 7-7.5 mm long, projecting forward to spreading,
pointed. The labellum (median petal) is 8-9 mm long and sharply curved backwards near the
middle, constricted and ending in a relatively short midlobe, often slightly crinkled. The
callus is shiny, prominently raised, with irregular margins, extending beyond the labellum
bend onto the midlobe. Column wings are bright or pale pink. There has been previous confusion
regarding the taxonomic status of this species, as it is very similar to  P. uroglossum
 and  P. pallens .

Location and habitat



Distribution

  The type specimen is from "moist meadows towards the Georges River" in the Sydney area. The
species is likely to be extinct from this area. Harden (1993) states that it is confined to the
Blue Mountains area. However, some authorities believe Prasophyllum  species from this
area are not  P. fuscum , but an undescribed species. In addition, some authorities believe
it is identical to  P. uroglossum  which occurs in the Wingecarribee area.

      Habitat and ecology

    - The total population, based on a single observation in 2007, is estimated to be
    approximately 25 mature individuals.

    

    - Grows in moist heath, often along seepage lines. The known population grows in moist
    sandy soil over sandstone amongst sedges and grasses in an area that appears to be
    regularly slashed by the local council.

    

    - Flowering does not necessarily occur every year, often skipping years. Although
    successful flowering and reproduction is likely to be dependent on favourable weather
    and habitat conditions, the factors which influence flowering behaviour are poorly
    understood. The seed is dust-like and is wind dispersed.

    

    - Dies back after the flowering and fruiting phases and exist only as a dormant tuber for
    much of the year. Like most terrestrial orchids, the species is believed to be semi or
    fully dependent on a mycorrhizal symbiont.

    

    - Dormant over summer and leaves emerge around April and flowering occurs from September
    to December.

    

    - The response of this species to fire is unknown, however fire stimulation of flowering
    is common within the genus.

    

    - Reproduction is by means of seed and probably to a lesser extent by vegetative
    reproduction. Flowers are not self-pollinating , as not all set seed and the perfume
    suggests an insect pollinator. The pollinator is unknown, but related species seem to be
    pollinated by a variety of thynnid wasps and perhaps hoverflies. It can be assumed that
    there is more than one pollinator species. The mature seeds senesce after seed dispersal
    in late December and January.

    

    - The species is very similar to  P. uroglossum  but has a much shorter midlobe on the
    labellum and by having the callus extending well onto the midlobe. It has also been
    confused with  P. pallens  which can be distinguished by its paler-coloured flowers
    with a musty smell.

    preference of the species in that region.

    - Hawkesbury/Nepean

    

    - Hunter/Central Rivers

    

    - Sydney Metro

    



 

Threats

    

    - Illegal collection by orchid enthusiasts .

    

    - Habitat loss and degradation due to agriculture, mining, urban development, changed
    hydrological conditions and decreasing water quality of swamps through poulltion or
    siltation, and weed invasion.

    

    - The very highly restricted distribution and extremely low number of mature
    individuals exposes the species to stochastic events.

    

    - May be threatened by roadside maintenance activities, where these involve habitat
    disturbance and slashing during the season of active growth, flowering and fruiting.

    



Recovery strategies



Priority actions are the specific, practical things that must be done to recover a threatened
species, population or ecological community. The Department of Environment and
Conservation has identified  9 priority actions  to help recover the Slaty Leek Orchid in
New South Wales.

What needs to be done to recover this species?

    

    - Incorporate a suitable fire regime for the species into land management practices.

    

    - Seek formal protection of all remaining areas of known habitat under
    conservation/management agreements.

    

    - Clearly identify roadside sites and ensure that processes are in place to prevent these
    sites from being impacted by roadside maintenance works.

    

    - Undertake surveys in known and potential habitat.

ORCHIDS

MORPHOLOGY

Growth Habit

Orchids are grouped according to two basic growth habits, namely: monopodials and
sympodials.

Monopodials are orchids with one main stem with grow taller every year. The stem lengthens,
adding new leaves to the top and aerial roots occasionally form along main stem. Flowers are
always borne laterally (between leaves) and successively from older nodes towards young
nodes. Monopodials include  Phalaenopsis ,  Arachnis ,  Vanilla ,  Aerides , 
Vandopsis ,  Vanda , Phyncostylis ,  Ascocentrum  and  Trichoglottis .

Sympodials are orchids with creeping ground stem or rhizome which sends out shoot which
eventually develops into stem and leaves. This new growth produces its own roots and leaves at
maturity. Flowers are formed at the terminals or at the sides of the stem. After flowering,
another shoot is formed at the base of the proceeding growth to repeat the cycle. The stem is
sometimes thickened and fleshy, forming pseudobulbs.  Cattleya ,  Dendrobium , 
Oncidium ,  Coelogyne ,  Bulbophyllum , are examples of orchid general with sympodial
growth habit.

Flower

Despite the complexity of the variety of orchid flowers, the structure is like any monocot
flower. There are three similar sepals and petals but one of the petals is highly modified into
an attractive structure known as  labellum  or lip. The lip attracts pollinators and
serves as landing platform for pollinating insects. In the center of the flower is an organ
called  gynostagium , gynandium , or column. On the inner side of the column is the stigma, a
shallow depression which produces a sticky solution where pollinia are deposited.

Orchid Plants

Unlike seeds of other flowering plants, orchid seeds are so minute consisting of an embryo
with little or no stored food. Orchid seeds are produced literally by the thousands or even
millions ( Cattleya labiata ) but only a few develop into mature plants.

Life of orchid seed is very critical during early stages of germination. Unless a symbiotic
relationship with a beneficial fungus is established, orchid seed will die. The fungal aid or
mycorrhiza  is a mass of fungus hyphae, usually of species  Rhizoctonia . During
germination,  mycorrhiza  infects the basal end of the seed and releases an enzyme which
converts starch, an energy of germination and enhances further its development. Orchids are
limited to the environment with suitable fungus, where sugar and amino-nitrogen compounds
are readily available for seed germination.

GENERA/SPECIES/HYBRIDS

The family  Orchidacease  consists of about 20,000 to 35,000 species distributed into 800
genera. This constitutes roughly 10% of all flowering plants in the plant kingdom. There are
many hybrids and cultivated forms which continue to increase at an average rate of more than
1,000 per year.

Many endemic species are found in the Philippines, which have gained worldwide recognition
by orchidists. There are about 130 genera and 941 species, of which 25 genera and 140 species
based on consecutive estimates are of commercial value.

Dendrobium

The genus  Dendrobium  contains a very large number of heterogenous species. It has erect,
cane-type pseudobulb and bears flowers with relatively long vase-like.

This group is naturally distributed in warm and humid areas, thus resulting hybrids require
warm and humid environment with abundant sunlight for optimum growth and development.

In the Philippines, the  Dendrobium  group includes among others  Den. Taurinum Lindl.,
  Den. Stratioles Reichb. f. ,  Den. Superbeins Reichb.f. ,  Den. Phalaenopsis Fitsp. , 
Den Biggibum Lindl .

Hybrids

In the Philippines, the following Dendrobium hybrids appear promising for cutflower
production:  Purple:  Den. Tomie, Jacquelyn Concert, Den. Norman Jackson, Den. Vera
Patterson x Den. Betty Hecht; Off-White- Den. Jacquelyn Thomas;  Yellow : Den. May Neal
Crosses, Mary Mac, Bethy Ho;  White:  Den Water Oumme, Den. Neo Hawaii, Den. Jack Hawaii,
Den. Multico White, Den. Jacqueline Thomas x Den. Alice Spalding, Den. Singapore White.

Vanda

This group is generally sun-loving and robust with colorful, beautifully-shaped flowers,
heavy substance and long-lasting.

    Vandas are divided into three: 1) strap-leaf; 2) terete; 3) semi-terete.

    1 - Strap-leaf Vandas - These are epiphytes with flat, channeled leaves. These include V.
    Sanderana, V. Luzonica, V. Lamellata, V. Coerules, V. Limbata. Some strap-leaf hybrids
    for cutflower have performed and flowered well locally. These are: V. Rotchildiana, V.
    Veraruth, V. Lenavat, V. Laurel Yap and V. Onomea.

    

    2 - Terete Vanda - Mostly terrestial plants with cylindrical, pencil-like leaves. Most
    commercially important hybrid is V. Miss Joaquin.

    

    3 - Semi-terete Vanda - highly floriferous, making them desirable for cutflower. These
    are derived from crossing terete hybrid with strap leaf species/hybrid.

    



The following hybrids are found to flower well under local conditions: V. Josephine van
Brero, V. Tanancy Yan, V.T.M.A., V. Patricia Low, V. Emma van Davente and V. Velthius crosses.

CATTLEYA AND ITS ALLIES

Modern Cattleyas consists of a complex group of hybrids created by combining cattleya
species or hybridization with closely allied genera such as  Laelia ,  Brassavola , 
Broughtonia . Known as "Cattleya Alliance", these are natives in Brazil, Columbia, Central
America and Mexico. Genus Cattleya is a very interesting diversified group of orchids with
broad spectrum of colors and types.

    Some of the more famous hybrids are:

    1 - Purple Cattleyas , like Lc. Bonanza, Blc. Norman's Bay, Bc. Culminant;

    

    2 - White Cattleyas , like C. Bow Bells, C. Bob Betts, C. General Patton, and C. General
    Japhet;

    

    3 - Semi-Alba Cattleyas  - also caled white with colored lip. Hybrids derived from C.
    Mossiae and C. Warscewiczis which are white with purple lips;

    

    4 - Yellow Cattleyas  - Blc. Malworth, Blc. Jane Helton, Blc. Malvern and Lc. Lorraine
    Shirai; and

    

    5 - Red Cattleyas  - Slc. Falcon "Alwanderi", Slc. Jewel Box, Lc. Desert Orange and Lc.
    Rojo.

    



PHALAENOPSIS

The graceful bearing of the Phalaenopsis, whether native species or advanced hybrids is
quite pleasing to the eye. The long, slender flower stalk bears the flower high and the arcs
away from the leaves appearing fragile yet regal.

Some promising species are  P. Amabilis ,  P. Stuartiana,   P. Schilleriana ,  P.
Equestris ,  P. Leuddemaniana  and  P. Sanderara.

    The following hybrids are promising for cutflower production:

    1 - Large White  - Phal Anne Cavaco, P. Grace Palm, P. Dos Pueblos and P. Quisumbing;

    

    2 - White with Red Lip  - Phal. Eva Lou, P. Queen Emma and P. Ruby lips; and

    

    3 - White Stripes  - Phal. Percy Porter

    



GROWTH REQUIREMENTS

Basically, the growth requirements of any plants are temperature, water, light, aeration
and nutrition. These are the environmental factors which a good grower should try to
stimulate for each type of orchids.

Temperature  - cool-growing orchids prefer night temperature of 10 oC to 18.3 oC (150 oF-65
oF) and 15.6  oC to 21 oC (60  oF-70  oF) day temperature, like  Cymbidiums , 
Odontoglossums and some  Phaphiopedilums .

For the intermediate group like Cattleyas, some  Dendrobiums  and  Oncidiums , night
temperature needed is 12.8  oC to 15  oC (55  oF-60  oF) and day temperature ranges from
18.3  oC to 21 oC (65  oF-75  oF).

Most orchids grown in the Philippines are warm-growing where night temperature is below 18.3
oC and day temperature rising to 21 oC to 32  oC. thse temperatures are ideal for growing
Renanthera ,  Vandas ,  Phalaenopsis ,  Aerides ,  Trichoglottis  and  Dendrobiums .

Light  - sun-loving orchids are  Arachnis ,  Renanthera ,  Arandas , and terete and
semi-terete  Vandas .

Partial shade orchids need lower light intensity for healthy growth. Example:  Dendrobium
,  Phalaenopsis ,  Cattleyas , and strap leaf  Vandas .

Orchid plants which receive enough light have short plump stems with yellowish-green
leather leaves. Those receiving too much sunlight are yellowish, stunted and even scorched.
Those under too much shade become green, soft and succulent with thin spindly stems.

Water  - generally, orchids prefer an atmosphere where relative humidity ranges from 50% to
85%. A constantly saturated atmosphere (100% relative humidity) is just as harmful as
constantly dry environment. High humidity and relatively low night temperature are
conducive to the development of many diseases and pathogens especially soft rot. Growers
often water the plants early in the morning so that before nightfall, the leaves are already
dry. During sunny days, it may be necessary to increase humidity of the atmosphere by misting
or wetting orchid house floor to enhance vaporization.

The need and frequency of watering depend on interacting factors, such as size of containers,
potting media, temperature, light intensity and air movement. Orchids in large containers
dry out more slowly than those in smaller pots. Plants in baskets, twigs and slabs require more
water than those in pots. During drier months, more frequent watering is required. Plants
suffering from lack of water become flaccid and stems and pseudobulbs become shrivelled.

Aeration  - orchids must have free circulating air around them. Orchids are found where
there is constant breeze. Stagnant air does not allow drying of potting medium and foliage.

Nutrition  - apply fertilizer either through liquid or dry method. By liquid feeding,
dissolve water soluble salts and apply resulting dilute solution to plant.

The amount and kind of fertilizer required by orchids depend upon growing conditions,
potting media, species and stage of development.

Young seedlings are usually given dilute solution of nitrogenous fertilizers or complete
fertilizers with higher nitrogen content plus phosphorous and potassium (4-1-1 or 2-1-1).
Pig manures, chicken or fish emulsion may be prepared and applied once a week or once a month. As
plant gets older, increase phosphorous and potassium level correspondingly.

Generally, under conditions of more frequent rainfall, practice more frequent
fertilization as leaching is higher. When plants are dormant or inactive, do not fertilize
plants. Plants exposed to higher light intensities also require higher fertilizer or
nutrients than those grown under heavier shade.

Potting and Repotting  - potting of orchids varies according to genera or species.

For Cattleyas, some growers use clay pots with charcoal as potting medium. Remember not to
over pot them as medium remains wet for a long time in big pots. Place the bulb close to rim of pot
with the lead towards center.

An old Cattleya needs repotting when the plant has overgrown its pot and when potting
materials has deteriorated.

For  Vandas  and  Ascocendas , small seedlings are potted with little osmunda fiber and a
little charcoal. For older plants, coarse tree fern or charcoal maybe used for potting.
Another method is by mounting them in twigs on driftwoods or by hanging them in wooden baskets.

For  Dendrobium , pot them in clay pots or mount them on driftwoods. For large-scale
production, clay pots with charcoal are ideal.

For  Phalaenopsis , mount them in acacia or kakawati wood cuttings, or fern slabs. Or mount
them in pots with charcoal and little osmunda fiber.

In potting, the general rule to remember is to allow quick and complete drainage of the potting
medium.

Some types of orchids are planted directly in well-drained bed or in soil pots.

PROPAGATION

There are two groups of propagating orchids; asexual (vegetative propagation) and sexual
(seed and embryo culture).

Asexual or Vegetative Propagation

    Vegetative propagation can be done in any of the following methods:

    1 - Division  -  Cattleya ,  Dendrobium ,  Paphiopedilum  and  Cymbidium  can be
    multiplied through division. Separate three to four canes or bulbs from mother plant to
    form new plants by cutting through rhizome and pot them individually.

    

    2 - Formulation of Keikis and offshots  - occasionally, a bud will give rise to a young
    plant at the top, side of pseudobulbs, canes or at the nodes of flowering stem. The
    Hawaiians call these young plantlets from vegetative or flowering stem 'keikis'.
    Filipinos call them 'anak'. Once the young new roots develop, remove plantlets and pot
    separately.

    

    3 - Top cutting  - monopodial orchids, such as  Vandas ,  Ascocendas ,  Arachnis , 
    Renanthera ,  Trichoglottis , and even  Phalaenopsis  and  Doritis , are best
    propagated by top cutting. When plant becomes leggy, cut off top part, retain few roots
    and pot it separately. New roots develop readily by top cutting.

    

    4 - Tissue Culture  - Tissue culture is one of the most rapid methods of multiplying
    vegetative plant. It develops new plants in an artificial medium under aseptic
    conditions from very small parts of plants, such as shoots tip, root tip, pollen grain.
    Thousands or even millions of identical plants can be produced from a small tissue in a
    relatively short time.

    



Sexual Propagation or Seed Embryo Culture

Orchid sexual propagation is done through seed embryo culture. Orchid seed is so minute,
devoid of stored food for seed germination. However, during germination, fungi infect
orchid seeds and help convert complex starch to simple sugars, which serve as energy source.
That fungi and orchids have symbiotic relationship during germination.

    Under artificial or laboratory conditions, a sterile artificial medium with sugar and
    other nutrients is required. Through research, an excellent medium for growing seeds
    without fungi was developed. Inside the bottle where orchid seedling is grown is a
    miniature glasshouse which protect seedlings from unfavorable environmental
    conditions. Using artificial media has insured the growing of nearly all orchid seeds
    into mature plants.

    1 - Flasking and reflasking or protocorms  - when orchid seed or embryo is planted in a
    culture bottle, numerous seedlings germinate in a very limited space with little
    available food. The first sign of successful germination is when orchid seed starts to
    swell and turns green. As growth continues, the embryo becomes bigger and assumes a
    flattened top shape called protocorm. A small amount of seed sown produce hundreds of
    tiny photocorms growing in limited space. At this stage, transplant them into fresh
    medium and table for further development and rapid growth.

    

    2 - Composting and Repotting Seedlings  - Orchid seedlings are ready to be transplanted
    from culture bottles when roots and leaves are fully developed. Dendrobiums may be
    potted after 4 to 6 months. Vandas, Phalaenopsis and Cattleyas in 6 to 8 months after
    reflasking before seedlings are ready for community pots. Seedlings should be potted
    only in sterile potting medium and pots to avoid damping-off.

    Potting medium may consists of sterilized fine Osmunda fibers, charcoal, chopped tree
    fern ( paslak ).

    After removing seedlings from bottles, wash out all agar from seedlings and wash them in
    fungicide suspension. Drain excess moisture and sort out seedlings according to size.
    Small seedlings are planted in community pots, while the bigger ones are potted
    individually in small pots.

    



FLOWERING

Like most plants, orchids must attain a certain degree of vegetative growth before they are
capable of flowering. This is referred to as the stage of ripeness to flower.

For  Phalaenopsis , the minimum number of leaves is 3 before they will flower, 8 in  Vandas ,
and 14 in  Aranda . Vegetative growth of seedlings can be accelerated to attain the stage of
ripeness to flower. Optimum growing conditions such as high temperature, humidity,
adequate and continuous light, frequent application of dilute fertlizer have shown
hastening of flowering in  Vanda  and  Phalaenopsis .

    Factor affecting flower bud initiation

    - Photoperiodism - is the development of plants as conditioned by the length or duration
    of light. There are 3 orchid categories based on their response to photoperiod: 1)
    short-day; 2) day-neutral; and 3) long-day groups.

    

    - Temperature - for some orchids, low temperature is required to induce flowering.
    Temperature interacts with photoperiod as regards to flower induction. Some orchids
    required low temperature to induce flowering, as follows:  Cymbidium ,  Cattleya
    Mossiae ;  Dendrobium ,  Phaphiopedium ,  Phalaenopsis ,  Schilleriana .

    



HARVESTING

    Orchids flowers do not mature until 3 to 4 days after they open. It is important to know how
    old the blooms are before harvesting. Flowers cut before they mature will not hold up nor
    last as longer as the matured flowers. Spray-type orchid present no problem. Each floret
    opens 1 ½ to 2 days apart. If 3 or more flowers are open on the spike, the lower flower is
    mature and can be separated. Tweet

The Wild Banana Orchid





Image: http://www.gov.ky/pls/portal/url/ITEM/077E8C4678C840A0E04008030B0ACB55 The
woods provide shelter for several varieties of flowering plants, including orchids.
Probably the best known of Cayman's 26 species of orchids is the wild banana orchid, of which
there are two varieties: Schomburgkia thomsoniana var. thomsoniana, which originated on
Grand Cayman, and Schomburgkia thomsoniana var. minor, which came from Cayman Brac and
Little Cayman.

Both varieties have scented flowers with purple lips, although the petals are predominantly
white on the Grand Cayman variety, while the Sister Islands' has slightly smaller flowers,
with pale yellow petals. The flowers appear at the top of a long curved spike at the bottom of
which cluster banana-like pseudo-bulbs that give this orchid its name.

Virus diseases of orchids AG0177 Jane Moran, Knoxfield

November, 1999

Image: http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/icons/ecblank.gif







Orchids may be infected by a number of different plant viruses. As early as 1943 it was thought
that virus may have been responsible for yellowing symptoms observed on orchid leaves. Since
then, 10 viruses have been identified in orchids. The two viruses most important and
widespread in Australian cultivated orchids are Cymbidium mosaic virus (CyMV) and
Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV). Orchid viruses are known to reduce plant vigour and in
the case of Cattleyas, to reduce flower quality due to striping and flecking. 



Cymbidium mosaic virus (CyMV)



CyMV causes yellowing of the leaves that forms a mosaic pattern followed by a blackening and
death of that area of the leaf along the leaf margins. More specifically, CyMV has been shown to
cause colour breaking in Cattleya flowers. 



Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV)



ORSV was first known to cause a yellowing ringspot symptom on leaves of Odontoglossum grande
Lindl. It is now more commonly known to cause a characteristic diamond shaped yellowing of
Cymbidium leaves. This "diamond mottle" is also associated with yellowing streaks in the
cymbidium.



Symptoms



The symptomatology of orchid virus diseases is confusing to professional and amateur orchid
growers, as well as plant pathologists. Virus induced symptoms on the leaves of a particular
plant depend on many factors including plant genera and the environment. An infected host
plant that appears symptomless under one set of environmental conditions may show prominent
symptoms under different light and temperature conditions. It must be remembered that an
orchid can have a virus infection without showing any symptoms. 



Transmission and control



Both CyMV and ORSV are only transmitted by humans through handling and division of orchid
plants. There is no known transmission of these viruses by insects or through seed. Once an
individual plant is infected, it is impossible to cure it. Control of virus diseases in orchid
collections is possible if you have good management practices that do not permit spread of
virus from any infected plants to healthy ones. Therefore, when propagating plants, all
propagation implements such as knives, razor blades, benches and any other tools, should be
sterilised. Cutting implements should be dipped in alcohol or methylated spirits and
flamed, and benches should be washed down thoroughly with soap and hot water. 



If a new plant is introduced into a collection, the plant should be isolated from the main
collection for at least two months under low light intensity conditions. Under these
conditions, if a virus is present in the plant, symptoms are more likely to be expressed. 



However, some infected plants never produce symptoms. If a plant has developed symptoms of a
virus infection, it must be separated from the orchid collection or destroyed. Since not all
virus-infected plants express symptoms, visual assessment does not detect all infected
plants. The most reliable methods available for detection of virus infection are laboratory
techniques such as electron microscopy and serology.



For effective pest and disease control, correct diagnosis is essential. A commercial
diagnostic service is available at the Institute for Horticultural Development. For

USGS Botanists Help Identify a New Orchid, the Yosemite Bog-Orchid

An orchid so elusive, 70 years elapsed after George Henry Grinnell collected the first
specimens in 1923 before a new generation of botanists rediscovered its location in 1993. But
the plant’s identity remained a challenge to taxonomists. Now, two U.S. Geological Survey
botanists and a colleague at the New York State Museum have identified the orchid as a new
species, the Yosemite bog-orchid ( Platanthera yosemitensis ), according to a recent
publication in the journal of the California Botanical Society,  Madroño.

"The Yosemite bog-orchid is an example of how both historic and contemporary plant specimens
can serve to inform scientists and managers about the biological diversity of natural
reserves," said Peggy Moore, a USGS plant ecologist in El Portal, Calif., and one of the
botanists who identified the orchid.

A botanical mystery sparked work by Moore and fellow USGS botanist Alison Colwell–they had
noticed the anomalous distribution in the plant guide  Flora of North America  of a
southern Rockies bog-orchid that was also reported from Yosemite National Park in
California. Colwell and Moore are scientists and co-workers with the USGS Western
Ecological Research Center and both are conducting research to support the science needs of
the National Park Service.

Beginning in 2003, and building on the efforts of previous botanists involved in the search
for this mysterious orchid, Colwell and Moore relocated the site where others had collected
the orchid, mapped additional sites where they discovered it growing, and searched several
plant collections to examine bog-orchid specimens. Then, in consultation with Dr. Charles
Sheviak, Curator of Botany at the New York State Museum, they determined the orchid was a new,
undescribed species.

"This group of orchids constitutes a notoriously complex problem, and it’s only now after
nearly 2 centuries of study that we are beginning to understand what the species are," said
Sheviak, an authority on the group. "I’ve been studying it for 40 years and have described
other new species of Platanthera , so I’m used to being surprised. However, to find such a
strikingly distinctive plant in such a well-known locality is truly astonishing. The fact
that it appears to be confined to such a small geographic area is furthermore unique among
related species."

Yosemite bog-orchid is known currently from only nine sites within Yosemite National Park,
all on the granitic upland south of Yosemite Valley, between the main stem and the South Fork of
the Merced River. As the orchid’s range is understood currently, it is the only orchid
species endemic to the Sierra Nevada of California.

"The extreme small size of several of the populations puts them at risk of extirpation," said
Dr. Niki Nicholas, Chief of Resources Management and Science at Yosemite. "Sensitive
habitat as well as a delicate root system highlights conservation issues associated with
this species."

With an inconspicuous wand-like growth form and tiny flowers, the plant can be easy to miss in
meadows densely crowded with a wide variety of plants, including other kinds of bog-orchids.
Taxonomists use several technical features to help distinguish Yosemite bog-orchid from
other bog-orchids, including what a discerning nose might call its bouquet. Yosemite
bog-orchids have a strong musk component that, according to the authors, has been likened by
various observers to a "corral of horses, asafetida, strong cheese, human feet, sweaty
clothing, or simply disagreeable." The Yosemite bog-orchid may use this scent to attract
mosquitoes or flies for pollination purposes.

Yosemite bog-orchid also keeps company with other endemics in the upland area south of
Yosemite Valley, the authors noted. This area, largely free of ice during the most recent
glacial events in the last two million years, contains at least seven species of plants known
only from the central and southern Sierra Nevada. These include Yosemite onion, Yosemite
woolly sunflower, short-leaved hulsea, Yosemite ivesia, and Bolander’s clover.

"What a delight to find that, in the 21st century, such gems await discovery, or, in this case,
re-discovery, practically in our own backyard," said Colwell, a USGS botanist in El Portal,
Calif. "Doubtless more such finds await us."

Revealing the secret life

of orchids



Known for their often exquisite flowers,orchids are the largest family of flowering plants
in the world with over 30,000 species identified.They are distributed in most countries and
are especially prolific in tropical regions,where the majority of species grow on the trunks
and branches of trees.In temperate regions,such as southern Australia,most orchids grow in
the ground.

The endangered Blue Orchid ( Durabaculum nindii ) of north eastern Queensland,one of around
1,200 native Australian orchids.



In Australia there are between 1,200 and 1,400 orchid species with 80 per cent of these not
found anywhere else in the world.A number of these also have some extremely specialised
adaptations not seen elsewhere in the orchid family.For example two species of native
orchids spend their entire life-cycle underground,and many ground orchids from southern
Australia have become so specialised that they deceive and lure the males of a single species
of insect to their flowers to ensure pollination.

Working at the Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research (CPBR), a collaboration between CSIRO
Plant Industry and the Australian National Botanic Gardens,is a dedicated team of
scientists researching orchids in order to understand and conserve them.

Classifying orchids



An ongoing part of orchid research at the CPBR is to study the evolutionary relationships
within and between groups to identify natural groups and to help provide classification
systems of orchids.In so doing new species may be recognised and scientifically named.Study
techniques range from simple comparisons of plants and flowers to detailed microscopic
techniques and molecular extractions involving DNA.

Scientists studying orchids at the CPBR use the Australian National Herbarium orchid
collection of 48,000 dried specimens, 19,500 spirit-preserved specimens and 18,500 cards
of dissected flowers as well as the collection of live plants at the Australian National
Botanic Gardens.

Native orchid conservation



Accurate classification of orchid species is critical to their conservation.For example, a
localised or threatened species of orchid may look very similar to a widespread and common
species.Its survival may be at risk if the differences between the two are not brought to the
attention of conservation authorities.

CPBR also helps conserve orchids by researching cultivation techniques and seed
propagation.

Collecting orchids



Licensed collectors send orchid specimens to the CPBR that they gather from the bush across
Australia.The specimens are added to the herbarium collection and information about them
databased.Through this collecting more than 500 new species have been recognised in the past
15 years and the distribution patterns and conservation needs of others have been
determined.

Identifying orchids



The CPBR is developing an interactive key to help identify orchids that will contain pictures
and information about them.

Due for completion at the end of 2005 the key will be available to amateur and professional
botanists,students and orchid enthusiasts.

About the  Interactive Key to Australian Orchid Genera

Orchid relationships



Throughout the life of an orchid it forms relationships with other organisms.Most
importantly orchids rely on fungi to assist with the germination of seed,and in some cases
continue to work with fungi throughout their life for their continuing health and
development.Orchids may also grow on a host plant and depend on certain insects to pollinate
them.

Orchid seed



Orchid seed is the smallest seed of all plants,taking more than 1.25 million seeds to weigh a
single gram.A specific fungus allows orchid seed to germinate by effectively providing
energy to it that the orchid can ’t provide itself.Other plants are self sufficient at this
stage but not orchids. Scientists at the CPBR are working hard to understand this delicate and
necessary interference of fungi that allows orchid seed to germinate.

Orchid – host – fungi

The Common Dragon Orchid ( Drakonorchis barbarossa ) 

– a unique western Australian ground orchid that mimics a wingless female wasp to entice the
male to mate, to effect pollination.



CPBR researchers are investigating a group of epiphytic orchids,or orchids that grow on
trees,and their relationships,not only with their preferred host tree,but also with the
fungi that they are dependent on.Similar studies are underway into a group of ground orchids
which is widely distributed in Australia.Unravelling the complicated relationships
orchids have with their host and fungi could reveal just why these plants have become so
specialised and what the implications are if either the host or fungus are destroyed.

Pollination



Many species of orchids rely on very specific pollinating agents to ensure the pollination of
their flowers.Working with orchids in their natural habitat,scientists at the CPBR are
collaborating with other researchers to learn more about specific pollination
relationships.
