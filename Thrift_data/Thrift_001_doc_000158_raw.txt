Blessed Are The Wealth Makers

Wallace Hume Carothers (1896-1937)

DuPont made a fortune selling things like gunpowder and nitrocellulose to warring
governments (mainly to our own) up through and including the First World War. During the
roaring 1920s (and flush with cash before the crash) they decided to pursue pure research into
material science and established a new division at their fledgling Experimental Station
located near Wilmington, Delaware.



The company hired a young PhD chemist named Wallace Carothers to start up a new group.
Carothers was fascinated by long chain macromolecules ubiquitous in nature but which had
only recently been recognized as "polymers." With the exception of Bakelite , the first
synthetic plastic,* other synthetic polymers were unheard of, let alone commercially
successful.



DuPont's research gamble paid off and Carothers and his group brought the company
enormous success, first with the serendipitous discovery of neoprene, the first synthetic
rubber, and then with nylon. Neoprene and nylon were tangible wealth creation: making things
of value from what were, at the time, essentially waste products.



Nylon was Carothers' baby. Not only did he invent a synthetic replacement for silk, he
purposefully developed a new method of making polymers called step-growth polymerization .
He used the same durable type of linkages used by proteins (amide bonds), mimicking
nature. Nylon was the first synthetic fabric and was commercialized around 1938, just
in time to replace Asian silk which, along with natural rubber, went missing during the
Second World War.

We have a lot to thank Carothers for but he didn't stick around. He checked out early, killing
himself in 1937.

______________

* I have two items made from Bakelite: One is a late 1940's era Viewmaster device and the other is
my father's old Kit-Cat clock which I described here . Both of these items have the
characteristic fragility and tendency to chip common to Bakelite. Posted by

War Letters of German and English Soldiers



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pZBtyES4Pas/TeAGL747VWI/AAAAAAAAA5s/nz5V2sj-Krw/s320/Flanders-Fields-Poppies.jpg
Link to original Poppy-covered fields in Flanders evoke Britain's Remembrance Day on
November 11, but the original inspiring poem was written in May, closer to our American
Memorial Day.



I recently discovered two new books to nurture my obsession with soldiers' letters: War
Letters Of Fallen Englishmen , originally compiled by Laurence Housman and published in
1930, and  German Students' War Letters , originally compiled by Phillipp Witkop and
published, in German, in 1928. Both books were recently republished by the University of
Pennsylvania Press.



The two books are remarkably close.   Jay M. Winter , Yale historian, wrote introductions
for both volumes.  Here he captures what they both were about:

The entries in the book resemble gravestones, in a general way. There is the name, and instead
of military rank, there is his academic affiliation. Then follows the date and place of his
birth and his death. So far the parallel with a grave site [is] similar to that used in other
similar ventures, for instance, Laurence Housman's War Letters of Fallen Englishmen .
Housman's identification also includes the service arm and rank, which Witkop's book
avoids. Still, the similarity to a cemetery stone is clear. What both editions add, of course,
is a letter or several letters. This practice helps establish the individuality of the
soldier who died; without such special individuation, he would fade into an army of the dead
and therefore into oblivion. Thus these books offer two services to bereaved families. For
those whose sons or husbands or brothers had no known grave, these pages provide a kind of
surrogate resting place his remains never had. And second, the text of the letters does more
than just list his name, date of birth, and date of death. It is a kind of portrait, like those
found in East European cemeteries. The letters construct a snapshot of the mind of the fallen
soldier. The prose comes to stand for the man himself, his nobility, his beliefs, his
aspirations. It was as if he wrote his own epitaph.

Here is an example, chosen at random from  German Students' War Letters :

EDUARD BRUHN, Student of Theology, Kiel

Born October 18th, 1890, at Schlamersdorf.

Killed September 17th, 1915, in Russia

September 17th, 1915.  Dear Parents,---

I am lying on the battle-field badly wounded. Whether I recover is in God's hands. If I die, do
not weep. I am going blissfully home. A hearty greeting to you all once more. May God soon send
you peace and grant me a blessed home-coming. Jesus is with me, so it is easy to die. In heartfelt
love,  Eduard ____________________

Letters Home: "I haven't written for at least 3 weeks"

I last updated this series over a month ago. My late father wrote letters home to his family
while serving in the US Army between 1951-53. They're all arranged in reverse
chronological order from the "present" all the way back to boot camp:  Link



His writing pace slowed from almost bi-weekly to about once a month and he wrote just eight
more times before returning home in September, 1953. One day, augmented by photos, I hope to
republish them all together. Meanwhile, I intend to keep posting them here on their
originally posted calendar anniversary, time-shifted by exactly 58 years. Happy early
Father's Day, pop.



Part of the lapse was his own--here he admits not having written in more three weeks. The
young man who was to become my dad was growing apart from his home too. I wish there were more
glimpses into what his life was like then and not just for selfish reasons because I am a part of
him. His letters are, quite frankly, unremarkable--exactly what people said about the
1950's--especially the mid-1950's. He is a '50's "everyman" and now just a part of cultural
memory.



Of course much was going on. He was stationed near the Fulda Gap which was like a Maginot Line
between Allied and Soviet forces. East Germany was seething at this time: riots and
the subsequent brutal repression culminated on  June 17, 1953  in Berlin, just a few
weeks away from the time of this letter. Up to a hundred or more people were killed outright
(no one really knows) & over a hundred more were later executed and thousands disappeared.
But he apparently did not notice, or else he had no real knowledge of events at that time. But
the danger was real enough.

Hanau West Germany 

Dear Mom, Dad and all,



I haven't written for at least 3 weeks. I was waiting for a letter from you. I finally got one
today.



We sure are having hot weather, around 90 every day. Last week we went out on the rifle range. I
had to haul ammo in my jeep. I got to fire the sub-machine gun for reward. After everyone had
finished, I got to help get rid of what was left over. I was shooting at tin cans and most anything
I wanted to. [1]



Day after tomorrow I have to go in the field for a week. They are having some maneuvers north of
here and 2 jeeps and 2 officers are going. I will be driving one. They have to umpire the
maneuvers. [2]



Do you remember what I was doing 3 years ago tonight? Graduating from H.S. It seems like it's
been that long too. [3]



I haven't been swimming yet but I took some pictures out at a lake yesterday.



I haven't been going to church very regular. Maybe I will after I get back. I like to sleep Sun.
morning too well. Some weekends I have to drive someone. Still driving about 1000 miles a
month. Last Fri. I had to take a AWOL to Frankfurt to the guard house. He had been to France.



Bye bye for now,





Love,

V. ____________________

[1] He probably fired an M3 grease gun , the standard Army submachine gun at the time.



[2] Heavy armor maneuvers involving his outfit, the 141st Tank Battalion in the 3rd Armored
Division, US Army.



[3] Military conscription was a kind of "poor man's college" at the time. The original G.I.
Bill had recently been augmented. link Posted by

Meet the Priest who invented Flubber

Remember the storyline from Walt Disney's The Absent Minded Professor (1961)?  Fred
MacMurray played a small Midwestern college chemistry professor who invented a
miraculous substance which he named Flubber. He saved the football team and got the girl in the
end. I think I found the real-life embodiment-well, forget the getting the girl part and focus
on the chemistry and small midwestern university parts.

Reverend Julius Nieuwland (1878-1936)

I ran across the name Julius Nieuwland recently. Nieuwland was a priest and professor at Notre
Dame University. As part of his Ph.D research, Nieuwland discovered Lewisite which was
produced in tonnage quantitites by the U.S. during World War I as a poison gas.  Nieuwland had
nothing to do with this application and distanced himself from the molecule (it's named for an
enthusiastic supporter of gas warfare, named Lewis ). Later, as a professor of organic
chemistry at Notre Dame, Nieuwland successfully polymerized acetylene into
divinylacetylene, laying the groundwork for the discovery of neoprene by Du Pont.



One of Nieuwland's more famous students was Knute Rockne, which even explains the football
part of the otherwise bizarre Flubber story. Posted by

Element 23: Vanadium Adds Color



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8JjLw2sdjgI/TdwbNIVB_pI/AAAAAAAAA5k/UAy4-rh1v-4/s320/VO5.jpg

V anadium is the first element of color. The previous element, titanium, is actually the
essence of butt-white: Titanium dioxide, TiO 2 is commonly used in white paint and also as a
sunscreen. Of all the other previous elements, only chlorine is a pretty lime green. I suppose
that sulfur counts as yellow and boron counts as brown, and certain allotropes of
carbon counts as black--but only as solids. By "element of color" I mean that vanadium is the
first of many elements that form pretty colored water solutions :

 



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Conx63ciqaE/TdrtwpoEmKI/AAAAAAAAA5Y/Zbkq7MSBLhA/s320/399px-Vanadiumoxidationstates.jpg
Oxidation states of vanadium, from left +2 (lilac), +3 (green), +4 (blue) and +5 (yellow).

There's a reason why vanadium does this, but I'm going to hold off a simplified explanation
until I get to chromium (nominally the best example).



Vanadium's discovery is a bit sad in that its true discoverer, a fellow named del Rio, was
talked out of his discovery by a Frenchman. Our old friend Friedrich WÃ¶hler showed up and
straightened things out, but not before the Swedish name stuck. The whole naming history is
here .



Vanadium has an oxidation state of +5 (as in the oxide VO 5 ). That VO 5 has nothing to do with the
shampoo VO5, but I thought that the first photo bore such a striking likeness to the second
one that I put it here just to confuse things.



In the Periodic Table, vanadium belongs to Group 5. Chemistry students recognize the
convenient mnemonic for vanadium (V is five in Roman numerals). 



Most of the world's mined vanadium goes into steel where it alloyed with iron to improve its
strength. Vanadium also has some very interesting biological properties and may even be a
micro nutrient essential to humans (it is essential to rats and chickens). It also appears to
have promise in high-tech batteries. Posted by

How Titanium Gets All Touchy-Feely with Carbon

A titanium chloride catalyst holds one end of the growing polymer chain. The same
titanium atom simultaneously binds another incoming ethylene and stabilizes the
contortions leading to the insertion of the next link into the growing chain. Titanium does
this by polarizing ethylene's electrons while stabilizing a migration:

Home On The Range

I rejoined a local shooting range . They have dozens of different pistols and rifles to use
and try out. They also sell guns, but I'm not interested in that right now. This is a father/son
thing and my boy really likes doing it. I explained my attitude about guns back here . I'm
interested in the history of many things and I've decided to familiarize myself with many
"classic" weapons available at the range. 



An arbitrary starting point is the M1911 .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol. This weapon,
invented by John Browning, was used continuously by US Armed Forces between 1911 and 1985.
Most people recognize its classic lines: Link



Iron Sights doesn't have any original M1911s for use (they do have a couple for sale).  The
American company Kimber America makes a whole bunch of 1911 style 45's and I picked Stainless

Kimber Stainless Pro Raptor II .45 cal The Raptor II is pretty comfortable to shoot. There
isn't a lot of recoil for a .45 caliber. I don't like it as well as the Kimber Gold Match II, which
they used to have but no longer stock. Posted by

Ethylene, Daughter of Ethyl

Factoid for the day:

In the mid-19th century, the suffix -ene (an Ancient Greek root added to the end of female names
meaning "daughter of") was widely used to refer to a molecule or part thereof that contained
one fewer hydrogen atoms than the molecule being modified. Thus, ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) was the
"daughter of ethyl" (C 2 H 5 ). The name ethylene was used in this sense as early as 1852. Wiki link
I could blog all day about ethylene, but that factoid was something I didn't know until today.
Ethyl has lots of sisters too like Propyl, Butyl (one of the But-sisters), and Pentyl, etc .



Ethylene is ready for her close-up now:

Photo is from "The Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters" by Logan Marshall
(1912). Enlarge to read the faint caption "Theory" written on the ship.  S cientist David
Evans wrote a brief piece in the Financial Post called Climate Models Go Cold .*  He writes as a
scientist formerly on the "gravy train,' making his point-of-view all the more credible.
Evans understands all the data-even the ones not being talked about.



I'm reminded of the T.H. Huxley quote:

The great tragedy of science, the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.

Some time ago, I left the following comment on the Althouse blog.  Those comments now seem to
have disappeared down a memory-hole, but I still stand by what I said then:

chickenlittle said...



Nobelist Steven Chu, head of the DOE and Obama's top science guru, is all on board the CO 2 is evil
train. Link .



There is clearly an enormous investment in brainpower behind the notion that CO 2 causes
warming.



Here is how I distill the problem(s) confronting us:



(1) How, if incorrect about CO 2 , could the scientific consensus be so wrong?

  (a) Is the notion CO 2 causes warming now too big to fail?

  (b) Can the credibility of American (and world) science recover if wrong?



(2) If they are right about CO 2 causing warming, what would it take to convince the American
people that they are correct?

  (a) Clearly something has gone wrong with the PR-people are not convinced.

  (b) The present administration appears to say: fuck 'em- they (the people) don't believe
us? we're gonna force them. The possible techniques available to enforce compliance are
downright un-American.



(3) What really bothers me as a sceptic of the CO 2 causes warming is that if the Copenhagen
treaty is ratified and enforced, and warming does not occur, credit will be taken regardless
of the true cause. To me this is a heads I win tails you lose proposition for the CO 2 causes
warming folks. But more insidiously, it is the exact mechanism by which Science could ascend
to the status of a quasi-religion: give the people "miracle, mystery and authority" and they
will follow.



Sorry in advance for the longish post.

Karl Ziegler: "Consequences and Development of an Invention"



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KbKl7ctZs9s/TdK50bp4TWI/AAAAAAAAA4I/XrNdgTRMd7M/s320/ziegler_postcard.jpg
Karl Ziegler, German chemist (1898-1973)

Karl Ziegler, then director of the Max-Planck-Institute-for Coal Research, describing
what he and co-workers discovered ten years prior to winning the 1963 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry:

The catalyst is prepared simply by simultaneously pouring, with exclusion of air, two liquid
materials into about two liters of a gasoline-like hydrocarbon, after which ethylene is
introduced, while stirring. The gas is absorbed quickly; within an hour one can easily
introduce 300-400 liters of ethylene into the two liters of liquid. At the same time, a solid
substance precipitates, and can scarcely be stirred anymore. If the brown catalyst* is then
destroyed, by the addition of some alcohol and by the introduction of air, the precipitate
becomes snow-white and can be filtered off. In its final state it will accumulate in amounts of
300-500 g, as a dry, white powder. ~Karl Ziegler " Consequences and development of an
invention " ______________

*The two co-catalysts were titanium and aluminum chlorides



Polyethylene had been known earlier. A British company, ICI, held patents for what they
called "polythene" (hmm, maybe related to the Beatles' "plasticene"?), but ICI's
polyethylene was different animal than Ziegler's polyethylene. The difference is at the
atomic level. Though both plastics were polymers of ethylene, the older, inferior product
was highly branched:



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-q4-3dU4Nopc/TdKkeU_ZvWI/AAAAAAAAA4E/tf-ZHfegmC0/s320/branched+PE.jpg
Ziegler's new process for making polyethylene essentially made perfectly linear chains of
polymer with very little branching. The bulk properties of the two were markedly different.
The density differences are akin to what one expects from trying to pack together a bunch of
branches versus bunches of straight sticks.



Ziegler and his Institute became independently wealthy as the plastic age began in earnest.

Element 22: Titanium

Titanium is the carbon of transition metals. The Germans realized this early on. Look again at
this "carbo-centric" Periodic Table of the Elements from 1926:





Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bKEQyKK5nf8/TdFswvlu0rI/AAAAAAAAA34/syxff3_5F2M/s400/antropoff.jpg
Follow the color code (carbon is black) down and to the left. The association runs right
through titanium and zirconium, down to hafnium and thorium. To the right, the
rhymes-with-carbon pathway runs down through germanium, tin, and lead; I'll get to the
latter later after having some fun with the first row transition metals.



Titanium has probably touched more carbon atoms than any other single metal atom. And there
are two words for this Benjamin--just two words I want to say to you. Are you listening
Benjamin?

Treat The Wealth Well

At the heart of Energy Secretary Chu's newly released Strategic Plan 2011 is a Native American
saying:



Treat the earth well. It was not given to you by your parents, but loaned to you by your
children.*

I think the budget guys have a similar philosophy:



Treat the wealth well. It was not given to you by your parents, but loaned to you by your
children. ___________

Necessity is the Mother of Invention

During the First World War, Imperial Germany was cut off from its sources of fixed nitrogen
(mainly Chilean saltpeter and bat guano which it needed to make gunpowder). The
ingenious Fritz Haber  invented the direct conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia
using hydrogen gas. Haber won the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this feat, despite
Germany having lost the war and despite Haber's wartime culpability in making things like
chlorine and phosgene gases for trench warfare (out of fairness, note that Nobel Laureate
Victor Grignard headed up the French contingent of poison-gas warriors). The commercial
Haber-Bosch process literally enabled the subsequent worldwide population bloom known
as the Green Revolution, though it was reduced to practice by the likes of Norman Borlaug . The
Haber-Bosch process is still used today, highly refined, but essentially unchanged. A "Holy
Grail" of modern catalytic chemistry is to invent new catalysts that work at normal pressures
and temperatures.



During the Second World War, coal-rich Nazi Germany was cut off from commercial sources
of crude oil, which it needed to wage highly mechanized warfare. The ingenious Franz
Fischer and Hans Tropsch had invented and developed the conversion of coal to liquid
hydrocarbons in the 1920's. Their technology was scaled up and used to augment military and
domestic liquid fuel supplies. Fischer and Tropsch did not win a Nobel Prize for this feat,
perhaps because Fischer died in 1947 (Tropsch had died in 1935). The commercial
Fischer-Tropsch process is still practiced worldwide, and could play a greater
role for our coal-rich nation, but not under the present Administration, which prefers
alternatives.



Among the alternatives is the photochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to a reduced
product such as carbon monoxide. link This technology, coupled with existing " syn-gas "
technology for converting carbon monoxide and hydrogen (derived from water) to
hydrocarbons, is another "Holy Grail."  These research efforts have a way of ramping up as
the relative price of crude oil increases and remains high. We may be entering such a phase.

Horsing around in Del Mar

This is the 3rd year our family has gone to this event. My daughter rides at a local stable which
is dominated by teenaged girls. I'm always amazed when I see the professionals ride because at
that level, the sport is equally split, men and women.

Congratulations to Chris Pratt for winning the $100,000 Grand Prix of Del Mar in California
last night!



UPDATE : The event was actually horses and riders jumping link . I should have taken some of my
own photos and I haven't been able to find any from Saturday night.



There were a couple of exciting moments: One horse went right up to the highest hurdle and
"refused" it. The rider turned the horse around and tried again. This time the horse refused
again but momentum threw the rider right over the fence. It was as if the horse said "You do
it". Fortunately nobody got hurt. Posted by

"A dry martini," [Bond] said. "One. In a deep champagne goblet."  "Oui, monsieur." "Just a
moment. Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet.* Shake it very
well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?" "Certainly,
monsieur." The barman seemed pleased with the idea. "Gosh, that's certainly a drink," said
Leiter. Bond laughed. 'When I'm...er...concentrating,' he explained, "I never have more
than one drink before dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold and
very well-made. I hate small portions of anything, particularly when they taste bad. This
drink's my own invention. I'm going to patent it when I can think of a good name." —Ian
Fleming, Casino Royale (1953) _____________________

* Kina Lillet  used to contain quinine, a muscle relaxant. Kinda like how Coca-Cola used to
contain cocaine, and 7-Up contained lithium citrate. Posted by

Element 21: Transitioning to Real Metals

Look again at the "long form" of the Periodic Table:





Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nOTdqVGnOTk/TMXauVpvW-I/AAAAAAAAAto/xf1rRJB1wf4/s400/pte-long.png
click to enlarge I've already blogged through three layers of the so-called main group
elements, which are the two bluish colored blocks of elements bookending the reddish
elements "inside." With reference to the very top left, calcium has the coordinates 4 down and
2 across. To get to the next element to the right, we have to jump the gap across the red rare
earth metals and the underlying (and notorious) actinides to the first pink element,
scandium.



Scandium is the first of the so-called transition metals, named from the Latin, trans ire =
to go across or to cross over. The metaphor is that we're "crossing over" on our way back to the
right-hand block of main group elements. Destination: krypton.



That's about all I want to say about scandium. But guess where it was discovered?  Yep. And
by somebody named Lars even. Link Posted by

Element 20: This is Calcium's Finest Hour

AGW is not just about burning hydrocarbons, making CO 2 , and pumping it up the
atmosphere. Natural mechanisms exist for getting CO 2 out of the atmosphere and back into
the lithosphere. Trees, which tie the earth and sky, do this quite well. But more important
is the formation of calcium carbonate, CaCO 3 .

When rocks weather, calcium is released into lakes and rivers. This happens slowly at sea
shores but also in mountains and calcium eventually makes its way to the sea. There is a
pre-existing supply in the oceans: Calcium is the third most abundant metal in sea water,
behind sodium and magnesium.



Sea creatures make sea shells and coral from dissolved calcium. In addition,
phytoplankton take up CO 2 as well before being consumed. Part of the global carbon cycle
involves the perpetual rain of dead sea creatures to the sea floor where the carbon is
eventually consumed by tectonic subduction. These processes offset CO 2 released by humans.
The question is, how fast:



The natural pH of the ocean is determined by a need to balance the deposition and burial of CaCO 3
on the sea floor against the influx of Ca 2+ and CO 2 3− into the ocean from dissolving rocks on
land, called weathering. These processes stabilize the pH of the ocean, by a mechanism called
CaCO 3 compensation...The point of bringing it up again is to note that if the CO 2
concentration of the atmosphere changes more slowly than this, as it always has throughout
the Vostok record, the pH of the ocean will be relatively unaffected because CaCO 3
compensation can keep up. The [present] fossil fuel acidification is much faster than
natural changes, and so the acid spike will be more intense than the earth has seen in at least
800,000 years. link Never was so much owed by so many to so little. Posted by

50 Years Of MyTunes: A $20 Reward...

...for the verified identity of this song. I want to buy it from iTunes or the like. I wouldn't be
offering money if I knew what it was.





I'm working on a blog post about instrumental surf, and I want to include this. Here's what I
know about it.  I recorded the song on WORT listener sponsored radio in about 1986 or 1987 in
Madison, Wisconsin. I subsequently lost the original play list, and now have it only on a
compilation. I think I mislabeled it as Link Ray.



Update : Jason made the right call: It's Sandy Nelson's   And Then There Were Drums from 1962.

Conversations with Henry: That man was a genius

Henry : Linus Pauling had an answer for that little orbital problem you mentioned here .



Me : Pauling had answer for everything. The greatest chemist ever.



Henry : He was an interesting guy. You knew he was up here with me for a while? He had a falling
out with Cal Tech.  I remember he used to come to seminars and always sat in the first row. He
was well past retirement age then. Anyways, he tended to nod off when the lights went down
during talks. Especially if the speaker showed too many dahls of slides.



Me : What are dahls?



Henry : A dahl is a unit of boring slides. Named after a famous crystallographer who used to
put people to sleep at his talks. A "dahl" is approximately 10 boring slides. You do remember
what slides are?



Me : Yeah. They were considered an improvement on overheads.



Henry : Linus Pauling was first and foremost a crystallographer. One time (I
remember this clearly) he woke up when the lights went back up and asked the speaker a
devastating question about a structure -- I mean the man could demolish arguments in his
sleep. It was like he threw an intellectual dart at the speaker and hit him right in the
forehead.



Me : Heh, I heard people used to say that about you too...
