From the taxi window on the way to the hotel, all I could see \xe2\x80\x93 at a distance \xe2\x80\x93 were the striking silhouettes of an old church, few grand domes, spires and stately buildings. To my surprise, they looked dirty, as if covered by soot. I was expecting more from the famous Saxon capital.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The next disappointment was the hotel: my room was right across the railroad that had just brought me from Berlin \xe2\x80\x93 noisy. When I asked about air conditioning, the portly concierge lady told me there was none, and by her voice it was clear she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pleased with the question. There were no hangers in the closet, either. When I opened the window, a very fast train was crossing like a bullet in front of me. Definitely not my day.\n            </p>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <div style="width: 310px" id="attachment_228" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n              <a href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG00587-20120808-11021.jpg" shape="rect">\n                <img height="225" width="300" alt="Downtown Dresden" src="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG00587-20120808-11021-300x225.jpg" title="Dresden " class="size-medium wp-image-228"></img>\n              </a>\n              <p class="wp-caption-text">\n                <em>Dresden\xe2\x80\x99s skyline, on a cloudy afternoon in August</em>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <p>\n              After spending most of the night awake, the next morning I\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 noticed that everything in the hotel was old, from the carpet to everything else, as if frozen in the 50\xe2\x80\xb2s or 60\xe2\x80\xb2s styles. The people were old too, mostly East German couples staring at me with curiosity when I entered the breakfast room. Having been locked behind the Iron curtain for over 40 years, they also looked strange to me in their old-fashioned outfits and hairdos. Looking for orange juice and finding none, I asked for a newspaper \xe2\x80\x93 in English, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak German. Bad idea: the whole room stopped eating to look at me disapprovingly. It must be the war, I imagined. They probably cling to their memories, and English must be the last language they want to hear.\n            </p>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <div style="width: 310px" id="attachment_235" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n              <a href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG00535-20120806-1800.jpg" shape="rect">\n                <img height="225" width="300" alt="Highly-talented musicians perform on Dresden streets" src="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG00535-20120806-1800-300x225.jpg" title="Dresden street artists" class="size-medium wp-image-235"></img>\n              </a>\n              <p class="wp-caption-text">\n                <em>On each corner of Dresden, young musicians show their art</em>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <p>I was determined to see Dresden no matter what, but asking the concierge how to get a taxi to the historic district didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be the right thing, either: \xe2\x80\x98 Why a taxi? Take the tram, it\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper\xe2\x80\x99. What a strange place!</p>\n            <p>\n              So I took the tram, actually very clean and efficient \xe2\x80\x93 and cheap, as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for it. I was waiting for someone to pay the ride to, but no one came. Before stepping down, I saw a paying machine by the exit door, but it returned the change I put in. Asking for instructions didn\xe2\x80\x99t help, either, as no one spoke English. I felt guilty, but the tram was already moving and I had to get out.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Now\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 in the town\xe2\x80\x99s center, I could confirm that the buildings were indeed dark, but also also majestic, in an elaborate rococo style, bold and imposing. Walking through narrow streets and passages, I discovered surprising charming areas that seemed to have been scrubbed clean, plenty of boutiques, elegant hotels \xe2\x80\x93 and tourists. Lots and lots of them, everywhere.\n            </p>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <div style="width: 235px" id="attachment_350" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n              <a href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG00527-20120806-17211.jpg" shape="rect">\n                <img height="300" width="225" alt="High-quality street music in Dresden" src="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG00527-20120806-17211-225x300.jpg" title="Young musicians perform on Dresden streets" class="size-medium wp-image-350"></img>\n              </a>\n              <p class="wp-caption-text">\n                <em>In Dresden, the quality of street music is very high.</em>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <p>\n              But what really caught my attention was the music coming from under medieval arcades, where groups of young musicians sang and played instruments for the tourists. Street musicians are not unusual in Europe, but the quality of the sounds produced by the young performers was exceptional, the kind of talent we pay hefty prices to see in New York\xe2\x80\x99s Carnegie Hall or the Metropolitan Opera.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 It was hard to resist the allure of the perfectly-tuned voices and melodies, and for a long time I went from one group of musicians to another, leaving change in each one of their hats.

Reading a tourist guide while savoring an excellent cup of coffee in a plaza surrounded by stately 18th-Century buildings, I learned that as far back as the 15th Century Dresden was already a city of arts with a strong tradition of court music and choirs. Later, Weber, Schumann, Wagner and many other heavyweights musicians of their time \xe2\x80\x93 of all times \xe2\x80\x93 spent most of their creative years in the city; Richard Strauss even premiered nine of his operas in its imposing\n              <em>Samper Opera</em>\n              House.\n            </p>\n            <div style="width: 310px" id="attachment_353" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n              <a href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG00601-20120808-1613.jpg" shape="rect">\n                <img height="225" width="300" alt="City center, Dresden" src="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG00601-20120808-1613-300x225.jpg" title="Dresden" class="size-medium wp-image-353"></img>\n              </a>\n              <p class="wp-caption-text">\n                <em>Some of Dresden\xe2\x80\x99s old buildings are still covered by the soot left by the raids of WW II</em>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <p>\n              Culture was a priority for one of Dresden\xe2\x80\x99s most celebrated rulers, August the Strong, whose gigantic statue now faces the opera house. With his son Augustus III, he transformed the city in the most celebrated center of artistic activity in the 18th Century Germany, when it was known as \xe2\x80\x98the Florence of the north\xe2\x80\x9d. This outstanding legacy survives today in its many orchestras, choirs and music schools.\n            </p>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <p>\n              But not all has been music in the city\xe2\x80\x99s history. Dresden was also the stage for one of WW II most controversial episodes, the seemingly indiscriminate destruction of the city by Allied bombers in February of 1945, two days and nights during which most of the its center was turned into a landfill, and 25,000 thousands were killed by air raids.

Few minutes into the short flight to Berlin, already above German territory, I was captivated by the exact lines dividing the cultivated fields below, as if someone from above had drawn them with a ruler! For as long as the eye could reach, every single inch of land was planted in exact squares. Here and there, farm houses reminded that people lived there, and small forests separating properties completed a gorgeous carpet of men-made precision in all shades of green and yellow. Every once in a while, massive groups of giant white fans reached for the sky \xe2\x80\x93 power-generating wind mills, something we don\xe2\x80\x99t see in the US.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a different world\xe2\x80\x9d, I thought.

I wished I knew more about them, I thought while looking attentively a the changing landscape below. All I remember was my grandmother telling that her father emigrated for being \xe2\x80\x98tired of sending sons to wars\xe2\x80\x99. Was he referring to the Prussian conflict? Now flying over the land they left a century or so ago, I felt sorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her more questions. Did her parents find the peace they were looking for? And could this trip of mine actually be a way of connecting with that distant link?\n            </p>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <p>\n              Then Berlin.\n              <br clear="none"></br>\n              Berlin is a punch in the stomach. In the course of my first day there I went from dazzled to puzzled, from intrigued to awed, even perplexed. It takes time to process Berlin, it awakens all sorts of emotions \xe2\x80\x93 even pity.\n              <br clear="none"></br>\n              Yes, pity. As we all know, the German capital was heavily bombed at the end of WW II, when air raids killed thousands of people and left hundreds of thousands injured and homeless. By the end of the war, the city was a pile of rubble \xe2\x80\x93 magnificent churches, opera houses, museums, theaters, schools, hospitals, homes, everything was bombed to bits. The reasons for the tragedy are also well known,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to be touched by the scope of the destruction when looking at war photographs now in museums. Wars are stupid\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 whatever their reasons, but when they target some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s dearest cultural riches, they become pure insanity.\n            </p>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <div style="width: 310px" id="attachment_160" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n              <a href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Berlins-wealth-visible-everywhere.jpg" shape="rect">\n                <img height="225" width="300" alt="" src="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Berlins-wealth-visible-everywhere-300x225.jpg" title="Berlin\'s wealth visible everywhere" class="wp-image-160"></img>\n              </a>\n              <p class="wp-caption-text">\n                <em>The wealth of Germany, visible everywhere</em>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <p>\n              Germany of course lost the war, and Berlin was divided. As the West\xe2\x80\x99s stage against communism, West Berlin received massive injections of American capital and started to rebuild soon after, while the East had to pay 10 billion\n              <em>Deutsche marks</em>\n              to the Soviets as \xe2\x80\x98war reparation\xe2\x80\x99. Then in 1961 the Berlin Wall came up almost overnight, and for decades the Cold War divided not only the city but the world. Finally, em 1989, German reunification. I remember as if today \xe2\x80\x93 I came out of my kitchen in New York to watch news programs showing people on top of the Wall and huge numbers of East Berliners crossing to the West. History was being made as I cooked dinner that night. Now that anyone can walk from East to West Berlin crossing the Brandenburger Gate, it may seem like not a big deal. But few yards away, white crosses remind us of the many East Berliners who lost their lives trying to escape the so-called \xe2\x80\x98Democratic East Germany\xe2\x80\x99. Berlin is living history everywhere.\n            </p>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <div style="width: 310px" id="attachment_156" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n              <a href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Kennedy-in-Berlin.jpg" shape="rect">\n                <img height="225" width="300" alt="" src="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Kennedy-in-Berlin-300x225.jpg" title="Kennedy\'s visit to Berlin" class="size-medium wp-image-156"></img>\n              </a>\n              <p class="wp-caption-text">\n                <em>John Kennedy in Berlin, photos on a mural </em>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <p>\n              The Wall is mostly gone but for one or two parts still left up for tourists; East and West Berlin are now one single city. To my surprise, I found East Berlin more charming and friendly, perhaps because it was spared the sterile American architecture of the 60\xe2\x80\xb2s and 70\xe2\x80\xb2s, of which West Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s Postdamer Platz is the worst case \xe2\x80\x93 as soulless as a Midwestern shopping mall. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney was scarce in East Germany\xe2\x80\x9d, explained a local.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any to build anything\xe2\x80\x9d.\n            </p>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <p>\n              But unified Berlin is rich beyond anything I had seen, and signs of that wealth are everywhere \xe2\x80\x93 expensive brand-new cars on the streets, good-looking and well-dressed people, magnificent boulevards, high-price restaurants. In one of them, the traditional Lutter &amp; Wegner, a staple of East Berlin during the Cold War, I saw something quite interesting: three different refrigerators, one for French wines, one for German Riesling and one just for \xe2\x80\x93 cigars! I never even imagined that each type of wine requires different fridges, but the Italian waiter tried to correct my ignorance explaining that this care is absolutely crucial to preserve the taste of their wines. Oh well, if he says so\xe2\x80\xa6.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              And Berlin rebuilds with a vengeance, saving what was left of the city and adding to it an elegant modern architecture with advanced energy-saving technologies. The buildings being erected everywhere have a style of their own, pure\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Berliner, one that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen anywhere else \xe2\x80\x93 glass and sunlight seem to be a big part of it. Like in the\n              <em>Reichstag</em>\n              Dome, the old seat of the German parliament \xe2\x80\x93 set on fire, bombed, left to crumble, it now stands proud again, a testament to all the dramatic events that took place there. Empty lots still remind us that something \xe2\x80\x93 who knows what \xe2\x80\x93 once stood there. But at the pace things are happening, in few years these spaces will be occupied again; cranes work full time and don\xe2\x80\x99t stop until it gets dark. The city is looking beautiful, like a teenager girl who becomes a gorgeous woman. Embracing the River Spree, its many parks \xe2\x80\x93 yes, parks are everywhere, and people on bikes and young couples with children \xe2\x80\x93 give this old city the feel of new. Everywhere, art galleries remind us that Berlin is again about art. And fun \xe2\x80\x93 it boasts the greatest night life in Europe, hands down.\n            </p>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <div style="width: 310px" id="attachment_158" class="wp-caption aligncenter">\n              <a href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/View-from-the-Reichstag-Dome-Berlin.jpg" shape="rect">\n                <img height="225" width="300" alt="" src="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/View-from-the-Reichstag-Dome-Berlin-300x225.jpg" title="View from the Reichstag Dome, Berlin" class="size-medium wp-image-158"></img>\n              </a>\n              <p class="wp-caption-text">\n                <em>Berlin mixes old and new architecture with energy-savings technologies</em>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n            <p>Five days are not enough in Berlin, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much to see: castles, museums, shows, exhibitions, sports events, or just watch a never-ending parade of European leaders come ask chancellor Angela Merkel for money!

Every friend seems to have a special  vitamin mix, a cream to keep wrinkles off their tanned faces, a formula to make their skin shine or the hair grow stronger. Judging from their looks, these efforts are perfectly rewarded: it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for women over 50 to look like mid -\xe2\x80\x9930s elsewhere. So much so that a friend of mine jokes that \xe2\x80\x9cRio doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what a 50 year old woman looks like\xe2\x80\x9d.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              While the aesthetic standards are very high , they are quite different from the ones in the Northern Hemisphere: round shapes and feminine curves are a must, \xe2\x80\x98noticeable\xe2\x80\x99 butts considered a blessing. Being skinny is associated with illness, not with elegance. Brazilians definitely have their own beauty guideliness, and they are proud of it.

And we had passed on the same tunnel the accident took place, only half an hour before.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">We learned about it the next morning, checking out of the hotel. Tatiana had been out and came back almost in tears: \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Diana died not far from here last night\xe2\x80\x9d, she said. I remember the silence that fell upon all of us in the hotel lobby. No one could say a word.</p>\n            <p align="left">\n              That strange silence stayed with us on the way to the airport. Paris was quiet that morning, there was a weird stillness in the air, even the driver said nothing. My then ten year old daughter commented on how quiet things were and on Princess Diana\xe2\x80\x99s death. I replied with something like \xe2\x80\x9cshe was a beautiful person and she died in the most beautiful city\xe2\x80\x9d. But no one really talked much.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              We got to a Charles de Gaulle airport heavy with security guards, at the same moment\n              <a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push([\'_trackEvent\',\'outbound-article\',\'http://en.wikipedia.org\']);" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales" class="snap_shots" shape="rect">Prince Charles</a>\n              \xe2\x80\x98\n              <a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push([\'_trackEvent\',\'outbound-article\',\'http://www.raf.mod.uk\']);" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" class="snap_shots" shape="rect">Royal Air Force</a>\n              jet was landing. He had come to Paris to claim Diana\xe2\x80\x99s body. Unreal.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">A long time after that date, I learned that the young French woman who, with her doctor boyfriend, got to Diana\xe2\x80\x99s car crash site before anybody else, was the daughter of someone I knew well. The girl herself had been my guest in New York, years before. Small world we live in\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0</p>\n            <p align="left">I still remember well the days that followed, the amazing display of emotions worldwide, the feeling that Diana left too early. Some people capture our imagination more than others, I guess. She had something different, something hard to describe \xe2\x80\x93 she was real.</p>\n            <p align="left">I never met her, but each time I return to the Marais and beautiful Place des Vosges, I remember Diana. And I feel that we all lost something, that night in Paris.</p>\n          </div>\n          <p class="postmetadata">\n            Posted in\n            <a rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Paris" href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/category/paris/" shape="rect">Paris</a>\n            |\n            <a title="Comment on Paris, August 31st, 1997" href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/2008/01/13/paris-august-31st-1997/#respond" shape="rect">No Comments \xc2\xbb</a>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div id="post-7" class="post">\n          <h2>\n            <a title="Permanent Link to Charming Marais I" rel="bookmark" href="http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/2008/01/12/charming-marais-i/" shape="rect">Charming Marais I</a>\n          </h2>\n          <small>January 12th, 2008 </small>\n          <div class="entry">\n            <p>\n              <img alt="Place des Vosges" src="http://www.goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/place-des-vosges.jpg"></img>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">I first fell in love with the Marais district of Paris in 1998.</p>\n            <p align="left">\n              I was coming to Paris via Geneva, Switzerland, where I had left my 11 year old daughter in a summer camp at a school called\n              <em>Le Rosey</em>\n              . It was the first time she was going to be away from home, and I was a bit anxious about it. Friends had assured me that the school was a great place for girls to learn French fast. I knew it had a good reputation, but still\xe2\x80\xa6 It\xe2\x80\x99s a long way from home in New York, I was thinking all along.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              Knowing how I was feeling, my friend Sherry decided to come along to help. Our plan was to come back to New York via Paris, after spending few days in the French capital. I would make sure my daughter was fine in Geneva, before returning to the US. It was also a good excuse to see Paris again, of course.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">The night before we left Geneva, Brazil lost the world soccer championship to France. I was born in Brazil, and soccer is a serious business for us. Needless to say, I was not in a good mood leaving Geneva.</p>\n            <p align="left">\n              We got to Paris in the midst of huge commemorations.

Yes, we were. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6</span>\n              </em>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              I felt better the next morning; a night at the Ritz can cure me of any woes. The always perfect doorman put us both on a taxi and told the driver: \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Place des Vosges\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd. I remembered from French classes that Place des Vosges had been the residence of French writer Victor Hugo, of\n              <em>Les Miserables</em>\n              fame, but I was not familiar with it. We were in for quite an experience\xe2\x80\xa6\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              One enters\n              <a onclick="javascript:_gaq.push([\'_trackEvent\',\'outbound-article\',\'http://en.wikipedia.org\']);" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_des_Vosges" class="snap_shots" shape="rect">\n                <em>Place des Vosges</em>\n              </a>\n              through vaulted arches that separate it from the rest of the Marais area. It is the oldest square in Paris, a perfectly symmetric square surrounded by houses with the exact same facade. The feeling is of being back to the Middle Ages \xe2\x80\x93 finished in 1612 to commemorate the wedding of King Louis XII with Anne of Austria, the square and the houses around it were built with red bricks and strips of yellow stone resting over square pillars. For centuries these were the homes of the French aristocracy. Easy to see why.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              Our lunch at\n              <em>L\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2Ambroisie</em>\n              didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t disappoint, either. Starting with the building itself, a\n              <em>hotel particulier</em>\n              facing the square \xe2\x80\x93 antique tapestries on the walls, chairs covered in velvet, wood floors \xe2\x80\x93 everything reminded of old world elegance and of a different, more refined era. The food was extraordinary; each new serving opened the way to new tastes and nuances never experienced. The plates were so beautifully presented, that at a table next to ours few Japanese gentlemen \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c all dressed in identical blue suits \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0were filming it all. As soon as the waiter placed the food in front of them, each man would get a camera, point it to his plate, and start recording. We were so amused by the scene we could not help watching. Even the cooks came out of the kitchen to look.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              After dessert, a waiter brought us a tray of cigars to choose from. Visibly confused as to whom to offer them first, as cigars are always offered to men, he clearly felt better when Sherry told him \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t smoke cigars, thank you. Our husbands do, but they could not be with us today\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd. We all laughed at the sign of relief on his face.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              This was a long, delicious and memorable lunch, one never to be forgotten. Leaving that temple of great food and getting back to the \xe2\x80\x98real\xe2\x80\x99 world, we took time to walk around the Marais. Charmed by its beautiful architecture, we were at the same time surprised at how lively, modern and hip the area was. It is full of art galleries, bistros, brasseries, special boutiques and people from all over the world. We just loved it, and vowed to go back some day.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              It wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be this time I would see the Marais again. Back at the hotel, there was a message for me: my daughter was not happy in the summer camp, and needed to see me. Immediate change of plans: I would be on the next train back to Geneva. As for Sherry, she decided to go to London visit her Wellesley friends who live there, before returning to New York.\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">Never a dull moment, I thought to myself, as my train slowly left Paris\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0</p>\n          </div>\n          <p class="postmetadata">\n            Posted in\n            <a rel="category tag" title="View all
