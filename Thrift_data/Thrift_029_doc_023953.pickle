Each stop of this \n\t\t\ttrip is important, but among them all, this moment occupies a \n\t\t\tspecial place in my heart and in the hearts of my countrymen -- a \n\t\t\tmoment of kinship and homecoming in these hallowed halls.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                Speaking for all Americans, I want to \n\t\t\tsay how very much at home we feel in your house.

Here the rights of free people and the \n\t\t\tprocesses of representation have been debated and refined.

My first opportunity to \n\t\t\tstand on British soil occurred almost a year and a half ago when \n\t\t\tyour Prime Minister graciously hosted a diplomatic dinner at the \n\t\t\tBritish Embassy in Washington. Mrs. Thatcher said then that she \n\t\t\thoped I was not distressed to find staring down at me from the grand \n\t\t\tstaircase a portrait of His Royal Majesty King George III. She \n\t\t\tsuggested it was best to let bygones be bygones, and in view of our \n\t\t\ttwo countries\' remarkable friendship in succeeding years, she added \n\t\t\tthat most Englishmen today would agree with Thomas Jefferson that &quot;a \n\t\t\tlittle rebellion now and then is a very good thing.&quot;\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, from here I will go on to Bonn and then Berlin, where there stands a grim symbol of power untamed.

In the center of Warsaw, \n\t\t\tthere is a sign that notes the distances to two capitals. In one \n\t\t\tdirection it points toward Moscow; in the other, it points toward \n\t\t\tBrussels, headquarters of Western Europe\'s tangible unity. The \n\t\t\tmarker says that the distances from Warsaw to Moscow and Warsaw to \n\t\t\tBrussels are equal. The sign makes this point: Poland is not East or \n\t\t\tWest. Poland is at the center of European civilization. It has \n\t\t\tcontributed mightily to that civilization. It is doing so today by \n\t\t\tbeing magnificently unreconciled to oppression.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                Poland\'s struggle to be Poland, and \n\t\t\tto secure the basic rights we often take for granted, demonstrates \n\t\t\twhy we dare not take those rights for granted.

Time is on our side.&quot; It was \n\t\t\teasier to believe in the march of democracy in Gladstone\'s day -- in \n\t\t\tthat high noon of Victorian optimism.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                We\'re approaching the end of a bloody \n\t\t\tcentury plagued by a terrible political invention -- \n\t\t\ttotalitarianism. Optimism comes less easily today, not because \n\t\t\tdemocracy is less vigorous, but because democracy\'s enemies have \n\t\t\trefined their instruments of repression. Yet optimism is in order, \n\t\t\tbecause day by day democracy is proving itself to be a \n\t\t\tnot-at-all-fragile flower. From Stettin on the Baltic to Varna on \n\t\t\tthe Black Sea, the regimes planted by totalitarianism have had more \n\t\t\tthan 30 years to establish their legitimacy. But none -- not one \n\t\t\tregime -- has yet been able to risk free elections. Regimes planted \n\t\t\tby bayonets do not take root.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                The strength of the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity" shape="rect">\n                  <font color="#0000FF">Solidarity Movement in Poland</font>\n                </a>\n                demonstrates the truth told in an underground \n\t\t\tjoke in the Soviet Union.

I think understanding this \n\t\t\tfact has always made you patient with your younger cousins -- well, \n\t\t\tnot always patient. I do recall that on one occasion, Sir Winston \n\t\t\tChurchill said in exasperation about one of our most distinguished \n\t\t\tdiplomats: &quot;He is the only case I know of a bull who carries his \n\t\t\tchina shop with him.\'&quot;\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                But witty as Sir Winston was, he also \n\t\t\thad that special attribute of great statesmen -- the gift of vision, \n\t\t\tthe willingness to see the future based on the experience of the \n\t\t\tpast. It is this sense of history, this understanding of the past \n\t\t\tthat I want to talk with you about today, for it is in remembering \n\t\t\twhat we share of the past that our two nations can make common cause \n\t\t\tfor the future.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                We have not inherited an easy world. \n\t\t\tIf developments like the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_revolution" shape="rect">\n                  <font color="#0000FF">Industrial Revolution</font>\n                </a>\n                , which began here in \n\t\t\tEngland, and the gifts of science and technology have made life much \n\t\t\teasier for us, they have also made it more dangerous.

And I don\'t have to tell \n\t\t\tyou that in today\'s world the existence of nuclear weapons could \n\t\t\tmean, if not the extinction of mankind, then surely the end of \n\t\t\tcivilization as we know it.

But the crisis is \n\t\t\thappening not in the free, non-Marxist West, but in the home of \n\t\t\tMarxist-Leninism, the Soviet Union. It is the Soviet Union that runs \n\t\t\tagainst the tide of history by denying human freedom and human \n\t\t\tdignity to its citizens. It also is in deep economic difficulty. The \n\t\t\trate of growth in the national product has been steadily declining \n\t\t\tsince the fifties and is less than half of what it was then.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                The dimensions of this failure are \n\t\t\tastounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in \n\t\t\tagriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the \n\t\t\tprivate sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet \n\t\t\tagriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine. These \n\t\t\tprivate plots occupy a bare three percent of the arable land but account \n\t\t\tfor nearly one-quarter of Soviet farm output and nearly one-third of \n\t\t\tmeat products and vegetables. Over-centralized, with little or no \n\t\t\tincentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best \n\t\t\tresource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant \n\t\t\tshrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military \n\t\t\tproduction is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we \n\t\t\tsee here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its \n\t\t\teconomic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by \n\t\t\tpolitical ones.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                The decay of the Soviet experiment \n\t\t\tshould come as no surprise to us.

And one of the simple but overwhelming facts \n\t\t\tof our time is this: Of all the millions of refugees we\'ve seen in \n\t\t\tthe modern world, their flight is always away from, not toward the \n\t\t\tCommunist world.

They threatened death to any who voted, \n\t\t\tand destroyed hundreds of buses and trucks to keep the people from \n\t\t\tgetting to the polling places. But on election day, the people of El \n\t\t\tSalvador, an unprecedented 1.4 million of them, braved ambush and \n\t\t\tgunfire, and trudged for miles to vote for freedom.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                They stood for hours in the hot sun \n\t\t\twaiting for their turn to vote.

They fight for a cause -- for the belief that armed \n\t\t\taggression must not be allowed to succeed, and the people must \n\t\t\tparticipate in the decisions of government -- the \n\t\t\tdecisions of government under the rule of law.

Over the past several decades, \n\t\t\tWest European and other Social Democrats, Christian Democrats, and \n\t\t\tleaders have offered open assistance to fraternal, political, and \n\t\t\tsocial institutions to bring about peaceful and democratic progress. \n\t\t\tAppropriately, for a vigorous new democracy, the Federal Republic of \n\t\t\tGermany\'s political foundations have become a major force in this \n\t\t\teffort.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                We in America now intend to take \n\t\t\tadditional steps, as many of our allies have already done, toward \n\t\t\trealizing this same goal.

And next \n\t\t\tspring there will be a conference of world authorities on \n\t\t\tconstitutionalism and self-government hosted by the Chief Justice of \n\t\t\tthe United States. Authorities from a number of developing and \n\t\t\tdeveloped countries -- judges, philosophers, and politicians with \n\t\t\tpractical experience -- have agreed to explore how to turn principle \n\t\t\tinto practice and further the rule of law.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                At the same time, we invite the \n\t\t\tSoviet Union to consider with us how the competition of ideas and \n\t\t\tvalues -- which it is committed to support -- can be conducted on a \n\t\t\tpeaceful and reciprocal basis. For example, I am prepared to offer\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brezhnev" shape="rect">\n                  <font color="#0000FF">President Brezhnev</font>\n                </a>\n                an opportunity to speak to the American people on \n\t\t\tour television if he will allow me the same opportunity with the \n\t\t\tSoviet people.

It has happened in the past -- a \n\t\t\tsmall ruling elite either mistakenly attempts to ease domestic \n\t\t\tunrest through greater repression and foreign adventure, or it \n\t\t\tchooses a wiser course. It begins to allow its people a voice in \n\t\t\ttheir own destiny. Even if this latter process is not realized soon, \n\t\t\tI believe the renewed strength of the democratic movement, \n\t\t\tcomplemented by a global campaign for freedom, will strengthen the \n\t\t\tprospects for arms control and a world at peace.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                I have discussed on other occasions, \n\t\t\tincluding my address on May 9th, the elements of Western policies \n\t\t\ttoward the Soviet Union to safeguard our interests and protect the \n\t\t\tpeace.

And that\'s why we must continue our efforts to \n\t\t\tstrengthen NATO even as we move forward with our Zero-Option \n\t\t\tinitiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our \n\t\t\tproposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile \n\t\t\twarheads.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                Our military strength is a \n\t\t\tprerequisite to peace, but let it be clear we maintain this strength \n\t\t\tin the hope it will never be used, for the ultimate determinant in \n\t\t\tthe struggle is not going -- that\'s now going on in the world will not be bombs and \n\t\t\trockets, but a test of wills and ideas, a trial of spiritual \n\t\t\tresolve, the values we hold, the beliefs we cherish, the ideals to \n\t\t\twhich we are dedicated.\n              </font>\n            </p>\n            <p align="left">\n              <font size="2" face="Verdana">\n                The British people know that, given \n\t\t\tstrong leadership, time, and a little bit of hope, the forces of good \n\t\t\tultimately rally and triumph over evil.

This reluctance to use those vast resources at our \n\t\t\tcommand reminds me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the \n\t\t\tBlitz.
