Aj Discala writes about the 2012 Cannes Film Festival

Posted on June 5, 2012 by Reply



Aj Discala as many other people love the Cannes Film festival. Why? Because it is the most
exciting, says Aj Discala with many great movies, great events and a great location launching
the Cote d’Azur season.Â Once a year celebvilles finest migrate from Hollywood to the
sunkissed shores of the south of France.

The 65th annualÂ  Cannes Film Festival Â was held from May 16 to May 27, 2012Â Italian
film directorÂ  Nanni Moretti Â was the President of the Jury.

Aj Discala explains that the festival opened with the US filmÂ  Moonrise Kingdom , directed
byÂ  Wes Anderson Â and closed with the lateÂ  Claude Miller ‘s final filmÂ 
ThÃ©rÃšse Desqueyroux .



Aj Discala says everybody wants to know who the winner is.TheÂ  Palme d’Or Â was
awarded to Austrian directorÂ  Michael Haneke Â for his filmÂ  Love . Haneke
previously won the Palme d’Or in 2009 forÂ  The White Ribbon .



Aj Discala shares that the Austrian directorâ€™s powerful and understated film stars
two French acting icons â€” 85-year-old Emmanuelle Riva and 81-year-old Jean-Louis
Trintignant â€” as an elderly couple coping with the wifeâ€™s worsening health.

Cannes jury member Jean Paul Gaultier praised the performances of the two actors and the
â€œincredible connectionâ€� they established in the movie.

However, says Aj Discala this years festival was characterized by bad weather and the film
selection was criticized.

Although Wes Andersonâ€™s coming-of-age picaresqueÂ  â€œMoonrise
Kingdomâ€� launched the festival on May 16 on a whimsical, adventurous note, the movie
hewed to the directorâ€™s signature controlled, ultra-composed style and thematic
preoccupations with difficult families, precocious children and young love.

Aj Discala explains that from the outset, when organizers announced the directors competing
for the festivalâ€™s top honor, Cannes seemed stalled in a past era: Of the 22 films
competing for the Palme dâ€™Or this week, not one is directed by a woman, a nod to the
mythical image of the heroic auteur that Cannes is famous for championing in its 66-year
history. Posted in Uncategorized | Tagged AJ Discala | Leave a reply



Aj Discala on Raf Simons joining the Christian Dior team and replacing Galliano

Posted on April 10, 2012 by 2



Aj Discala clarifies that since march 2011 the famous French brand Christian Dior was without
any creative director and designer. John Galliano who has been designing for this emblematic
brand for several years had to leave the company after some anti-Semite insults in a Parisian
bar, says Aj Discala .





Image:
http://ajdiscalaarticle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/3eia9-dior_logo-300x300.gif

 

Christian Dior is one of LVMH â€™s companies with a very strong brand awareness for its
accessories, clothes cosmetics and perfumes. The head quarter is in Paris on rue Francois 1er
next to the flagship store on Avenue Montaigne explains Aj Discala .



Raf Simons is a Belgian designer who just finished his last mission at Jil Sander where he was
the creative director. At Jil Sander , Aj Discala explains, Raf Simons was in charge for the men
and women collections since 2005.



Aj Discala heard about the longue list of possible designers to replace Galliano, who was a
genius and who did a tremendous job with the brand and its image over the past 10 years. Raf
Simons, says Aj Discala was one of the last of this very long list.

Amongst possible replacer of Galliano, names such as Marc Jacobs who is currently the
creative director at Vuitton were mentioned says Aj Discala . Riccardo Tisci who has the same
job at Givenchy , as well as Nicolas GhesquiÃšre at Balenciaga were all part of this list.

For Aj Discala , Raf Simons was just a perfect fit at Christian Dior. His last collection he
designer for Jil Sander Fall/Winter 2012 shown in Milan in February was a real homage for the
Dior New look

The question for Aj Discala is to know how the absence of any creative director affected the
business at Dior. Even if Galliano left over one year ago, the sales of the brand were up 22% in
2011.

For Aj Discala it was important that the designer taking over Gallianoâ€™s job was known
in the fashion world. For the shareholders it is a relief to see Raf Simons joining the
Christian Dior team.

Aj Discala on the Oscar Nights 2012, the unexpected winner of the night isâ€Š.

Posted on February 28, 2012 by 7



For Aj Discala The Artist , is all a symbolâ€Š Aj Discala explains its about believing in an
idea..This movie was unmarketable first in business people’s minds says Aj Discala . But
they were proven wrong as Art is not about money defends Aj Discala . Art it is about passion,
about moving humanity, about creating new bold visions!





Image:
http://ajdiscalaarticle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-27T045023Z_1_BTRE81Q0DG500_RTROPTP_2_OSCARS-300x208.jpg

“The Artist” won five Oscars including best picture, which made it the first silent movie
to triumph at Hollywood’s highest honors since the original Oscar ceremony 83 years ago.

Among other prizes, says Aj Discala for the black-and-white comic melodrama The Artist were
best actor for Jean Dujardin and director for Michel Hazanavicius.



Â ”The Artist” was produced by Thomas Langman who thanked in his speech Claude Berri.
However, explains Aj Discala most people do not know that Claude Berri was his father who dies
in 2009 and who won an Oscar in 1966 so the honor is especially sweet. Berri was an actor and
producer of some of Franceâ€™s finest films such as “Jean de Florette” and “Manon
of the Springs.”



â€œThe other top Oscars went to Meryl Streep as best actress for “The Iron Lady,”
Octavia Spencer as supporting actress for “The Help” and Christopher Plummer as
supporting actor for “Beginners.”

Glenn Close very well deserved the best actress award for her great performance in Albert
Nobbs. Aj Discala was also very impressed by Rooney maraâ€™s acting in The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo.

“The Artist” is the first silent winner since the World War I saga “Wings” was named
outstanding picture at the first Oscars in 1929 had a silent film earned the top prize.

The other wins for “The Artist” were musical score and art direction. Martin
Scorsese’s Paris adventure “Hugo” also won five Oscars, all in technical categories.

 

Much ado about nothing…. Angelina Jolie showed some leg and it is all over the press.

Aj Discala about the 2012 Grammy Awards

Posted on February 13, 2012 by 10



Adele was the definite winner of the 54th Annual Grammy Awards Sunday night says Aj Discala .
Adele won all six awards for which she was nominated. It is not a surprise for Aj Discala that she
won album of the year for 21 and record of the year and song of the year for “Rolling in the
Deep.”





Image:
http://ajdiscalaarticle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Adele-Grammy-Awards-2012-300x229.jpg

It was touching to see Adele accepting the album trophy in tears writes Aj Discala . She got the
inspiration for the album 21 by “a rubbish relationship” as she said.



Aj Discala explains that it was a relief seeing Adele perform and hearing that her voice
survived her vocal cord surgery. Her voice is always touching and transmits a lot of emotion
explains Aj Discala . The crowd gave her a standing ovation for her great performance.



The sad news of the death of Whitney Houston impacted the Grammy broadcast heavily. The Grammy
host LL Cool J began the award show with a prayer dedicated to Whitney Houston. Aj Discala says
that one of the highlights of the night was Jennifer Hudsonâ€™s tribute to Whitney
Houston. Her performance of “I Will Always Love You” late in the show touched many to
tears. The audience closed their eyes and it was a silence apart of her voice. Hopefully says Aj
Discala Whitney Houston will be remembered for her great artistic career.

The award show was also full of great performances by artists including The Beach Boys, The Foo
Fighters, Adele, Katy Perry and Rihanna.

Aj Discala specially liked Rihannaâ€™s performance with Chris from Coldplay. Rihanna
is a great artist with multiple sides and styles.

As you could read in the new york Times says Aj Discala :

â€œDave Grohlâ€™s Foo Fighters received five awards for the album â€œWasting
Lightâ€� and for one of its tracks, â€œWalk.â€� The album, which was the first
No. 1 album for Foo Fighters, was recorded on analog equipment in a garage and was in the running
for album of the year.

â€œWe made this one in my garage with some microphones and a tape machine,â€� Mr.
Grohl said as the group accepted the Grammy for best rock performance. â€œIt shows the
human element of making music is whatâ€™s most important.â€�â€�

Aj Discala recommends reading the article published in The New York Times about this great
evening full of emotions.

Aj Discala comments on the Berlinale of this year 2012

Posted on February 10, 2012 by 7



Itâ€™s the time of the year says Aj Discala to get ready for Berlin.Â  Itâ€™s the
season of the Berlin International Film Festival, more commonly known as the Berlinale.





Image:
http://ajdiscalaarticle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/berlinale_impressionen_2007-036-300x252.jpg

 

With the ice-cold weather covering Europe, the success of this years festival was at risk
shares Aj Discala . With icy wind we are far away from Cannes or Venice who take place in May or
September.



For Aj Discala the main challenge is to attract international recognized superstars. If
there is one thing that has been missing from the festival in recent years, it has been major
marquee stars.





Image:
http://ajdiscalaarticle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/090212_AG_0112_IMG_x800-200x300.jpg

Dieter Kosslick, the head of the Berlinale focuses on presenting new discoveries, including
German films and the best from abroad. This new focus explains Aj Discala reanimates a
reputation, established by the Berlinale during the 1970s, of being the most political of the
A-List festivals in Europe.

â€œThis year, Kosslick and his team are also placing their bets on fresh films and ones
that address political issues. All 18 of the films in the running for the Golden Bear are world
premieres, and a whole series of festival entries have recent revolutions in the Arab world as
their subject matters. What’s more, the Occupy movement is also being featured in Tony
Gatlif’s documentary “Indignados,” and the first movies to come out about last
year’s earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan will also be shownâ€�

However, for this years Berlinale says Aj Discala the start of the festival is Angelina Jolie.
She will be showing “In the Land of Blood and Honey,” her debut work as a film director,
which is not an entry in the official competition. Aj Discala explains that its a disturbing
drama about the Bosnian War and, as such a perfect fit for the new focus of the Berlinale. Posted

Posted on January 24, 2012 by 6





Image: http://ajdiscalaarticle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/oscars-300x224.jpg
Finally theÂ  84 th Academy Awards nominees got published this morning, says Aj Discala .



Aj Discala is not surprised to read that The Artist is nominee for Best picture. Itâ€™s a
silent movie on black and white tribute to old Hollywood which is considered the favorite
after a series of recent critics and guild award wins.



Not only didÂ  Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius received nominations for both Best
Director and Best Original Screenplay says Aj Discala but in addition Jean Dujardin was
handed a bid for Best Actor for his turn as George Valentin, a silent film star. Aj Discala is
also very happy to read that BÃ©rÃ©nice Bejo, earned a nomination for Best Supporting
Actress.



“Hugo,” Martin Scorsese’s 3D family homage to film preservation earned 11
nominations leads the list of best picture Oscar contenders says Aj Discala .

“The Descendants,” the Alexander Payne-directed dramedy considered the other top
awards contender, was also nominated for Best Picture; Aj Discala says that George Clooney,
who stars as a beleaguered father, totally earnes a nomination for Best Actor. George Clooney
will be competing against his friend Brad Pitt in the best leading actor category.

Pitt’s “Moneyball” is nominated for six awards reports AJ Discala including the best
picture category for both.

For Aj Discala one of the best movies by far this year is “The Help,”. It is about the tale of
domestic workers in segregated Mississippi at the beginning of the Civil Rights era. Aj
Discala was pleased to see that it earned a Best Picture nod, as well as a nomination for Viola
Davis for Best Actress and nods for Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer for Best Supporting
Actress.

Here’s the entire list of nominees:Â  http://www.oscars.org/

AJ Discala looks forward to the 84th annual Academy Awards that will be televised live from

AJ Discala on LE Huffington Post:

Posted on January 23, 2012 by 5





Image: http://ajdiscalaarticle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/539w-300x199.jpg AJ
Discala comments on the first publication of the French edition of the Huffington Post. The
Huffington Post was founded by Arianna Huffington in May 2005, explains AJ Discala and
launched a few days later on May 9.



The difference of The Huffington Post Â is for AJ Discala its Â active community, with
over one million comments made on the site each month. The site offers coverage of politics,
theology, media, business, entertainment, living, style, the green movement, world news,
and comedy, and has news, blogs, and original content.



Arianna Huffington explains that : â€œthe new editions is an international
collaboration bringing together Le Monde , Les Nouvelles Ã‰ditions IndÃ©pendantes,
and the Huffington Post Media Group’s signature mix of news, blogging, community, and
social engagement, arrives today. While we will be importing the platform, technology, and
tools from across the pond, Le Huffington Post will be rooted in French culture and will
reflect France’s own unique personality, rich culture, and diversity of voices. And it
will do so at a time when France’s fortunes, challenges, and decisions are of great
consequence not only to the people of France but to all of Europe and the world beyond. For me,
today’s launch is the culmination of a lifetime of loving France and I’m delighted to
invite readers in France and French speakers throughout the world — as well as those who care
about its people, issues, and rich culture — to join the conversation.â€�

AJ Discala thinks that the choice of Anne Sinclair asÂ  Le Huffington Post’s editorial
director wasÂ  suitable.



Even if in the US Anne Sinclair is know as the wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the
International Monetary Found who was involved in a series of sexual scandals, she has a strong
knowledge of journalism clarifies AJ Discala .

Between 1984 and 1997 she hosted 7/7 , a weekly Sunday evening news and political show on TF1
that had one of the largest audiences in France. She became one of the country’s best known
journalists and conducted more than five hundred interviews over the course of the show’s
thirteen-year run.

On that show she hosted a one-hour interview with a leading French or international
personality, says AJ Discala . Amongst them a French presidents Francois Mitterrand and
Nicolas Sarkozy as well as US president Bill Clinton , and Mikhail Gorbachev , Shimon Peres ,
Felipe GonzÃ¡lez , German chancellors Helmut Kohl and Gerhard SchrÃ¶der , Hillary
Clinton , the UN Secretary General in New York during the first gulf war, and Prince Charles
.[4]

Although primarily focused on politics, her show also included celebrities such as Madonna ,
Sharon Stone , Paul McCartney , Woody Allen , and George Soros clarifies AJ Discala.

Sinclair won three Sept d’Or , the French equivalent of the Emmy Awards .[5]

However, when her husband Dominique Strauss-Kahn became French finance ministerÂ  Anne
Sinclair chose to leave the show to avoid conflict of interest, explains AJ Discala .

AJ Discala on the Golden Globes

Posted on January 17, 2012 by 4

http://ajdiscalaarticle.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/TheArtist-300x168.jpg
Â  AJ Discala Â  says there were many touching moments at the Golden Globe Awards
ceremony. Some of the highlights included Morgan Freeman’s heartfelt speech in accepting
the Cecil B. DeMille Award from Sidney Poitier and Helen Mirren.



But what got the attention and curiosity of AJ Discala is the French black-and-white comedy, a
homage to the “pre-talkie” era set in 1920s and 1930s Hollywood. Amongst others The
Artist star Jean Dujardin danced away with the Golden Globe award forÂ lead actor in a
comedy or musical motion picture.



In the film, Valentin’s relationship with the aptly named upstart Peppy Miller (Berenice
Bejo) changes his life in unexpected ways.

Jean Dujardin is already a household name in his native France, explains AJ Discala . He got his
first big break on “Un Gars, Une Fille,” a popular television sitcom. He met his wife at
this time, she had the main role as his wife.

AJ Discala asks what have Â ”Chicago” (2002), “Shakespeare in Love” (1998) and
“Driving Miss Daisy” (1989) all in common? Over the past 40 years, these are the only three
Oscar champs for Best Picture that first claimed victory at the Golden Globes in theÂ  Best
Comedy/Musical Picture race.

strike again thanks to “ The Artist .”

AJ Discala CEO of TBG comments on the economy

Posted on January 12, 2012 by 4



AJ DISCALA CEO OF THE BROADSMOORE GROUP (TBG) COMMENTS ON THE COMMENT APPEARED IN
TODAYâ€™S WSJ: GEORGE SOROS, THE BILLIONAIRE U.S. INVESTOR, SAID THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS
FACING A â€œVICIOUSâ€� DEFLATIONARY CYCLE AS MEMBERS OF THE EURO ZONE CUT BACK
SHARPLY ON SPENDING TO BRING THEIR BUDGET DEFICITS UNDER CONTROL, CRIMPING DEMAND AND
SQUEEZING PRICES.



Are things any better in the United States? AJ Discala CEO ofÂ  The Broadsmoore Group Â is
trying his best to shine light on both the service and consumer sectors to create employment
opportunities. Since October 2010 over 2700 jobs have even created by his company.



AJ Discala CEO Â  of TBG Â explains that with companies in our portfolio such as EmployUS
and HRAA , both located in Southern states and with national outreach in their perspectives,
we see bright futures.Â  These companies are focused on services in the energy and oil
sectors and in healthcare, both areas where AJ Discala sees growth potential, and both
somewhat immune to what is happening globally in the European markets. Until we see clarity
both here and abroad politically and economically, I am afraid we will just continue to bungle
along and hope that leaders will emerge to dig us out of the holes in which we now find
ourselves,â€� said AJ Discala CEO of The Broadsmoore Group.
