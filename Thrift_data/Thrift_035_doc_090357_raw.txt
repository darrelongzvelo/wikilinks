unrelated to the respective Soviet republics.

Russia views the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian SSRs as legal constituent republics of
the USSR and predecessors of the modern Baltic states.

Ð¡ÐŸÑ†ÐžÐ°Ð»ÐžÑ�Ñ‚ÐžÌ�Ñ‡ÐµÑ�ÐºÐžÑ…
Ð ÐµÑ�Ð¿ÑƒÌ�Ð±Ð»ÐžÐº , tr. Soyuz Sovetskikh
Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik ) abbreviated to USSR ( Russian : Ð¡Ð¡Ð¡Ð  , tr. SSSR
) or the Soviet Union ( Russian : Ð¡ÐŸÐ²ÐµÑ‚Ñ�ÐºÐžÐ¹
Ð¡ÐŸÑŽÐ· , tr. Sovetsky Soyuz ), was a constitutionally socialist state that
existed between 1922 and 1991, ruled as a single-party state by the Communist Party with its
capital as Moscow . [ 3 ] A union of 15 subnational Soviet republics , its government and economy
were highly centralised.

The Soviet Union had its roots in the Russian Revolution of 1917 , which deposed Nicholas II ,
ending three hundred years of Romanov dynastic rule . The Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin ,
stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd and overthrew the Provisional Government . The
Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was established and a civil war began. The Red
Army entered several territories of the former Russian Empire and helped local communists
seize power. In 1922, the Bolsheviks were victorious, forming the Soviet Union with the
unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics.
Following Lenin's death in 1924, a troika collective leadership and a brief power struggle,
Joseph Stalin came to power in the late 1920s. Stalin committed the state ideology to
Marxismâ€“Leninism and a centralised planned economy was initiated. As a result, the
country underwent a period of rapid industrialisation and collectivisation which laid the
basis for its later war effort and dominance after World War II. [ 4 ] [ 4 ] However, Stalin
repressed both Communist Party members and elements of the population through his
authoritarian rule.

During World War II , Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, opening the largest and
bloodiest theatre of war in history and violating an earlier non-aggression pact between the
two countries. The Soviet Union suffered the largest loss of life in the war, but halted the
Axis advance at intense battles such as at Stalingrad , eventually driving through Eastern
Europe and capturing Berlin in 1945. Having played the decisive role in the Allied victory in
Europe, the Soviet Union consequently occupied much of Central and Eastern Europe and
emerged as one of the world's two superpowers after the war. Together with these new socialist
satellite states , through which it established economic and military pacts , it became
involved in the Cold War, a prolonged ideological and political struggle against the Western
world led by the other superpower , the United States .

A de-Stalinisation period followed Stalin's death, reducing the harshest aspects of
society. The Soviet Union then went on to initiate significant technological achievements
of the 20th century, including launching the first ever satellite and world's first human
spaceflight , which led it into the Space Race . The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 marked a period
of extreme tension between the two superpowers, considered the closest to a mutual nuclear
confrontation. In the 1970s, a relaxation of relations followed, but tensions resumed when,
after a Communist-led revolution in Afghanistan , Soviet forces entered the country by
request of the new regime. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without
achieving meaningful political results. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]

In the late 1980s the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev , sought reforms in the Union,
introducing the policies of glasnost and perestroika in an attempt to end the period of
economic stagnation and democratize the government. However, this led to the rise of strong
nationalist and separatist movements. By 1991, the country was in turmoil as the Baltic
republics began to secede. A referendum resulted in the vast majority of participating
citizens voting in favour of preserving the Union as a renewed federation . In August 1991, a
coup d'Ã©tat attempt by hardliners against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the country,
instead led to its collapse. On 25 December 1991, the USSR was dissolved into 15 post-Soviet
states . [ 7 ] The Russian Federation , successor of the Russian SFSR, assumed the Soviet
Union's rights and obligations and is recognised as its continued legal personality. [ 8 ]

[ edit ] Geography, climate and environment

Main article: Geography of the Soviet Union

With an area of 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi), the Soviet Union was the
world's largest state, a status that is retained by the Russian Federation. Covering a sixth
of the Earth's land surface, its size was comparable to that of North America. The European
portion accounted for a quarter of the country's area, and was the cultural and economic
center. The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to
the south, and was much less populous. It spanned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) east to
west across 11 time zones , and almost 7,200 kilometres (4,500 mi) north to south. It had five
climate zones: tundra , taiga , steppes , desert, and mountains.

The Soviet Union had the world's longest border, measuring over 60,000 kilometres
(37,000 mi), two-thirds of it a coastline of the Arctic Ocean . Across the Bering Strait was
the United States . The Soviet Union bordered Afghanistan , China , Czechoslovakia , Finland ,
Hungary , Iran , Mongolia , North Korea , Norway , Poland , Romania , and Turkey from 1945 to 1991.

The Soviet Union's highest mountain was the Communism Peak (now Ismail Samani Peak ) in
Tajikistan , at 7,495 metres (24,590 ft). The longest river of the Soviet Union was the
Irtysh . The Soviet Union also included the world's largest lake, the Caspian Sea , and the
world's largest freshwater and deepest lake, Lake Baikal .

[ edit ] History

Main article: History of the Soviet Union

The last Russian Tsar , Nicholas II , ruled the Russian Empire until his abdication in March
1917, due in part to the strain of fighting in World War I . A short-lived Russian provisional
government took power, to be overthrown in the 1917 October Revolution (N.S. November 1917)
by revolutionaries led by the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin .

The Soviet Union was officially established in December 1922 with the union of the Russian ,
Ukrainian , Byelorussian , and Transcaucasian Soviet republics- each ruled by local
Bolshevik parties. Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many
constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities, the term
"Soviet Russia" â€“ strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist
Republic â€“ was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers and
politicians.

[ edit ] Revolution and foundation

Main article: History of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union (1917â€“1927)

Modern revolutionary activity in the Russian Empire began with the Decembrist Revolt of
1825. Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavourable to the
peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries. A parliamentâ€”the State Duma
â€”was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905 , but the Tsar resisted
attempts to move from absolute to constitutional monarchy . Social unrest continued and was
aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major cities.

Vladimir Lenin addressing a crowd in 1920.

A spontaneous popular uprising in Petrograd , in response to the wartime decay of Russia's
economy and morale, culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of the imperial
government in March 1917 . The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian Provisional
Government, which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to
continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I.

At the same time, workers' councils, known as Soviets , sprang up across the country. The
Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the
streets. On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd, ending the
rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets. This event
would later be known as the Great October Socialist Revolution . In December, the Bolsheviks
signed an armistice with the Central Powers , though by February 1918, fighting had resumed.
In March, the Soviets ended involvement the war for good and signed the Treaty of
Brest-Litovsk .

A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites , starting in 1917 and ending
in 1923 with the Reds' victory. It included foreign intervention , the execution of Nicholas
II and his family , and the famine of 1921 , which killed about five million. [ 9 ] In March 1921,
during a related conflict with Poland , the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed
territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia. The
Soviet Union had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established Republic of Finland
, the Republic of Estonia , the Republic of Latvia , and the Republic of Lithuania .

[ edit ] Unification of republics



On 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR , the
Transcaucasian SFSR , the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty of
Creation of the USSR [ 10 ] and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, forming the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics. [ 11 ] These two documents were confirmed by the 1st Congress of
Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, [ 12 ] Mikhail Kalinin , Mikha
Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze , Grigory Petrovsky , and Aleksandr Chervyakov , [ 13 ] on 30
December 1922.

On 1 February 1924, the USSR was recognized by the British Empire . The same year, a Soviet
Constitution was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union.

An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the
early days of Soviet power in 1917. A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik
Initial Decrees , government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin. One of the most prominent
breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan , which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet
economy based on total electrification of the country. The plan was developed in 1920 and
covered a 10-to 15-year period. It included construction of a network of 30 regional power
plants , including ten large hydroelectric power plants , and numerous electric-powered
large industrial enterprises. [ 14 ] The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year
Plans and was fulfilled by 1931. [ 15 ]

Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov , the head of the NKVD. After Yezhov was executed he was edited out of
this image.

From its creation, the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the
Communist Party (Bolsheviks) . [ 16 ] After the economic policy of " War Communism " during the
Russian Civil War, as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country, the Soviet
government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry
in the 1920s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax (see New
Economic Policy ).

The stated purpose of the one-party state was to ensure that capitalist exploitation would
not return to the Soviet Union and that the principles of Democratic Centralism would be most
effective in representing the people's will in a practical manner. Debate over the future of
the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin's death in
1924. Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a " troika " consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of
Ukraine , Lev Kamenev of Moscow, and Joseph Stalin of Georgia .

On 3 April 1922, Stalin was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union . Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate , which
gave Stalin considerable power. By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and
outmaneuvering his rivals within the party , Stalin became the undisputed leader of the
Soviet Union and, by the end of the 1920s, established totalitarian rule. In October 1927,
Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into
exile.

In 1928, Stalin introduced the First Five-Year Plan for building a socialist economy . While
encompassing the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution, it also
aimed to build socialism in one country . In industry, the state assumed control over all
existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization. In
agriculture, rather than adhering to the "lead by example" policy advocated by Lenin, [ 17 ]
forced collectivisation of farms was implemented all over the country.

Famines ensued, causing millions of deaths; surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent
to Gulags to do forced labour . [ 18 ] Social upheaval continued in the mid-1930s. Stalin's
Great Purge resulted in the execution or detainment of many " Old Bolsheviks " who had
participated in the October Revolution with Lenin. According to declassified Soviet
archives, in 1937 and 1938, the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people, of whom
681,692 were shot â€“ an average of 1,000 executions a day. [ 19 ] The excess deaths during
the 1930s as a whole were in the range of 10â€“11 million. [ 20 ] Yet despite the turmoil of
the mid-to-late 1930s, the Soviet Union developed a powerful industrial economy in the years
before World War II .

[ edit ] 1930s



The early 1930s saw closer cooperation between the West and the USSR. From 1932 to 1934, the
Soviet Union participated in the World Disarmament Conference . In 1933, diplomatic
relations between the United States and the USSR were established. In September 1934, the
Soviet Union joined the League of Nations . After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the
USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists , who were supported
by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany .

In December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new Soviet Constitution . The constitution was seen as a
personal triumph for Stalin, who on this occasion was described by Pravda as a "genius of the
new world, the wisest man of the epoch, the great leader of communism." By contrast, western
historians and historians from former Soviet occupied countries have viewed the
constitution as a meaningless propaganda document.

The late 1930s saw a shift towards the Axis powers . In 1938, after the United Kingdom and France
had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the USSR dealt with the Nazis as well, both
militarily and economically during extensive talks . The two countries concluded the
Germanâ€“Soviet Nonaggression Pact and the Germanâ€“Soviet Commercial
Agreement . The nonaggression pact made possible Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia,
Estonia , Bessarabia, northern Bukovina , and eastern Poland . In late November of the same
year, unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25
kilometres (16 mi) back from Leningrad , Joseph Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland .

In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with
the Japanese Empire in 1938 and 1939. However, in April 1941, USSR signed the
Sovietâ€“Japanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan , recognizing the
territorial integrity of Manchukuo , a Japanese puppet state .

Soviet soldiers in Berlin, May 1945. Main article: Eastern Front (World War II)

Although it has been debated whether the Soviet Union intended to invade Germany once it was
strong enough, [ 21 ] Germany itself broke the treaty and invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June
1941, starting what was known in the USSR as the " Great Patriotic War ". The Red Army stopped the
seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow , aided by an unusually harsh winter.
The Battle of Stalingrad , which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to the
Germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war. After
Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany
surrendered in 1945 . The German Army suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.

The same year, the USSR, in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta
Conference , denounced the Sovietâ€“Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 [ 23 ] and
invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945. [ 24 ] This
conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender
of Japan and the end of World War II.

The Soviet Union suffered greatly in the war, losing around 27 million people. [ 25 ] Despite
this, it emerged as a superpower in the post-war period. Once denied diplomatic recognition
by the Western world, the Soviet Union had official relations with practically every nation
by the late 1940s. A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the Soviet Union
became one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , which gave it the right to
veto any of its resolutions (see Soviet Union and the United Nations ).

The Soviet Union maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers for four decades
through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military strength, economic strength, aid to
developing countries , and scientific research, especially in space technology and
weaponry.

[ edit ] Cold War

Main article: Cold War

During the immediate postwar period, the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy,
while maintaining its strictly centralized control . It aided post-war reconstruction in
the countries of Eastern Europe, while turning them into satellite states , binding them in a
military alliance (the Warsaw Pact ) in 1955, and an economic organization ( The Council for
Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon) from 1949 to 1991, the latter a counterpart to the
European Economic Community . [ 26 ] Later, the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually
victorious Chinese Communist Party , and saw its influence grow elsewhere in the world.
Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United
States, became its enemies. In the ensuing Cold War, the two sides clashed indirectly using
mostly proxies.

Soviet Union and other countries in the world under a communist government modelled on the
country, after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and before the official Sinoâ€“Soviet
split of 1961.

Stalin died on 5 March 1953. Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist
Party officials opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly. Nikita Khrushchev , who had won the
power struggle by the mid-1950s, denounced Stalin's use of repression in 1956 and eased
repressive controls over party and society. This was known as de-Stalinization .

Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a buffer zone for the forward defense of its western
borders, and ensured its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European
countries into satellite states. Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-communist
uprisings in Hungary and Poland in 1956.

In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the USSR's rapprochement with the
West and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev's revisionism led to the
Sinoâ€“Soviet split . This resulted in a break throughout the global Communist
movement, with Communist regimes in Albania , Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with
China in place of the USSR.

During this period, the Soviet Union continued to realize scientific and technological
exploits: Launching the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 in 1957; a living dog, Laika in
1957; the first human being, Yuri Gagarin in 1961; the first woman in space, Valentina
Tereshkova in 1963; Alexey Leonov , the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft
landing on moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966 and the first moon rovers, Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2
. [ 27 ]

Khrushchev initiated "The Thaw" better known as Khrushchev's Thaw , a complex shift in
political, cultural and economic life in the Soviet Union. That included some openness and
contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on
commodity goods, allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high
levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well.

Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally
unproductive. In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet
deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The Soviet Union backed down after the United States
initiated a naval blockade, causing Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige. He
was removed from power in 1964.

[ edit ] Brezhnev era

Main articles: History of the Soviet Union (1964â€“1982) and Era of Stagnation

Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued,
consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai
Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the
early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader. In 1968 the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact
allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms.

Brezhnev presided over a period of dÃ©tente with the West (see SALT I , SALT II ,
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.

In October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted. The prevailing mood
of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change.
The long period of Brezhnev's rule had come to be dubbed one of "standstill", with an aging and
ossified top political leadership.

Gorbachev in one-to-one discussions with U.S. President Ronald Reagan .

Two developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling
of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at
reforms to reverse that process. Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan
administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the
Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, so that the USSR's hard currency reserves
became depleted. [ 28 ]

Brezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did
not last long. Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed
power; both died in less than two years. In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in
1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev .

Gorbachev made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called perestroika
. His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government
censorship.

Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988

Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the Soviet Union abandoned its nine-year war
in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces. In the late 1980s, he refused military
support to the Soviet Union's former satellite states, resulting in the toppling of multiple
communist regimes. With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East Germany and West
Germany pursuing unification, the Iron Curtain came down.

In the late 1980s, the constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards
potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR
constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede. [ 29 ] On 7 April
1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents
voted for it in a referendum. [ 30 ] Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for
their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce
legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the " War of Laws ".

In 1989, the Russian SFSR , which was then the largest constituent republic (with about half of
the population) convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies. Boris Yeltsin was
elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its
territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR's laws. The
period of legal uncertainty continued throughout 1991 as constituent republics slowly
became de facto independent.

A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991, with the majority of the
population voting for preservation of the Union in nine out of the 15 republics. The
referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty , which
would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight
republics.

Yeltsin stands on a tank to defy the August Coup in 1991.

The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the August Coup â€”an attempted
coup d'Ã©tat by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse
Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics.
After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while
Gorbachev's power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards
the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of
their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example), while the other twelve
republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union.

On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha
Accords , which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the
accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except
Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol , which confirmed the accords. On 25 December 1991,
Gorbachev yielded to the inevitable and resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the
office extinct. He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin,
the President of Russia .

The following day, the Supreme Soviet , the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union,
dissolved itself. This is generally recognized as marking the official, final dissolution
of the Soviet Union as a functioning state. The Soviet Army remained in place in the early
months of 1992, but was thereafter absorbed into the different military forces of the newly
independent states.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, Russia was
internationally recognized [ 31 ] as its legal successor on the international stage. To that
end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed overseas Soviet
properties as its own. Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union's
rights and obligations.

There were three power hierarchies in the Soviet Union: the legislative branch represented
by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union , the government represented by the Council of
Ministers , and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), the only legal party and the
ultimate policymaker in the country. [ 32 ]

[ edit ] Communist Party

Main article: Communist Party of the Soviet Union

At the top of the Communist Party was the Central Committee , elected at Party Congresses and
Conferences. The Central Committee in turn voted for a Politburo (called the Presidium
between 1952â€“1966), Secretariat and the General Secretary (First Secretary from
1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the USSR. [ 33 ] Depending on the degree of power
consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who
always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country [ 34 ]
(except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly
through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941). [ 35 ]
They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party
organization was democratic centralism , demanding strict subordination to higher bodies,
and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above. [ 36 ]

The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state largely through its control over
the system of appointments . All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme
Soviet were members of the CPSU. Of the party heads themselves, Stalin in 1941â€“1953
and Khrushchev in 1958â€“1964 were Premiers. Upon the forced retirement of
Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership, [ 37 ] but the
later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the largely
ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet , the nominal head of
state . The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by primary
party organizations . [ 38 ]

In practice, however, the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state
bureaucracy, particularly after the death of Stalin, was far from total, with the
bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party. [ 39 ]
Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although factions were officially
banned. [ 40 ]

of the Soviet Union

The Supreme Soviet (successor of the Congress of Soviets and Central Executive Committee )
was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history, [ 41 ] at first acting as a
rubber stamp institution, approving and implementing all decisions made by the party.
However, the powers and functions of the Supreme Soviet were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s
and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees. It gained
additional powers when it came to the approval of the Five-Year Plans and the Soviet state
budget . [ 42 ] The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium to wield its power between plenary
sessions, [ 43 ] ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the Supreme Court , [ 44 ] the
Procurator General [ 45 ] and the Council of Ministers (known before 1946 as the Council of
People's Commissars ), headed by the Chairman (Premier) and managing an enormous
bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society. [ 43 ] State and
party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central
institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most
of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide
party until 1990. Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees , local
Soviets and executive committees . While the state system was nominally federal, the party
was unitary. [ 46 ]

The state security police (the KGB and its predecessor agencies) played an important role in
Soviet politics. It was instrumental in the Stalinist terror , [ 47 ] but after the death of
Stalin, the state security police was brought under strict party control. Under Yuri
Andropov , KGB chairman in 1967â€“1982 and General Secretary from 1982 to 1983, the KGB
engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of
informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the
party-state structure, [ 48 ] culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high
party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s. [ 49 ]

[ edit ] Separation of power and reform

Main article: Perestroika

The Soviet constitutions , which were promulgated in 1918 , 1924 , 1936 and 1977 , [ 50 ] did not
limit state power. No formal separation of powers existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet
and Council of Ministers [ 51 ] that represented executive and legislative branches of the
government. The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no
settled mechanism of leadership succession existed. Bitter and at times deadly power
struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin [ 52 ] and Joseph Stalin , [ 53 ] as
well as after Khrushchev's dismissal , [ 54 ] itself due to a coup in both the Politburo and the
Central Committee. [ 55 ] All Soviet party leaders before Gorbachev died in office, except
Georgy Malenkov [ 56 ] and Khrushchev, both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal
struggle within the party. [ 55 ]

August Coup

In 1988â€“1990, facing considerable opposition, Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms
shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less
dependent on them. The Congress of People's Deputies was established, the majority of whose
members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989. The Congress now
elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, much stronger than before.
For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and
Council of Ministers. [ 57 ] In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the
President of the Soviet Union , concentrated power in his executive office, independent of
the party, and subordinated the government, [ 58 ] now renamed the Cabinet of Ministers of the
USSR , to himself. [ 59 ]

Tensions grew between the union-wide authorities under Gorbachev, reformists led in Russia
by Boris Yeltsin and controlling the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR , and
Communist Party hardliners. On 19â€“21 August 1991, a group of hardliners staged an
abortive coup attempt . Following the failed coup, the State Council of the Soviet Union
became the highest organ of state power "in the period of transition". [ 60 ] Gorbachev
resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the
existence of the USSR. [ 61 ]

[ edit ] Judicial system

Main articles: Law of the Soviet Union and Socialist law

The judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government. The Supreme Court
supervised the lower courts ( People's Court ) and applied the law as established by the
Constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet. The Constitutional Oversight
Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts. The Soviet Union used the
inquisitorial system of Roman law , where the judge, procurator , and defense attorney
collaborate to establish the truth. [ 62 ]

[ edit ] Political divisions

Main articles: Soviet Republic (system of government) and Republics of the Soviet Union

Constitutionally, the Soviet Union was a union of Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs) and the
Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), although the rule of the highly
centralized Communist Party made the union merely nominal. [ 32 ] The Treaty on the Creation of
the USSR was signed in December 1922 by four founding republics, the RSFSR, Transcaucasian
SFSR , Ukrainian SSR and Belorussian SSR . In 1924, during the national delimitation in
Central Asia, the Uzbek and Turkmen SSRs were formed from parts of the RSFSR's Turkestan ASSR
and two Soviet dependencies, the Khorezm and Bukharan SSR . In 1929, the Tajik SSR was split off
from the Uzbek SSR. With the constitution of 1936, the constituents of the Transcaucasian
SFSR, namely the Georgian , Armenian and Azerbaijan SSRs , were elevated to union republics,
while the Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs were split off from the RSFSR. [ 63 ] In August 1940, the Soviet
Union formed the Moldavian SSR from parts of the Ukrainian SSR and parts of Bessarabia annexed
from Romania . It also annexed the Baltic states as the Estonian , Latvian and Lithuanian SSRs .
The Karelo-Finnish SSR was split off from the RSFSR in March 1940 and merged back in 1956.
Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below). [ 64 ]

On 16 November 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR passed the Estonian Sovereignty
Declaration that asserted Estonia's sovereignty and declared the supremacy of Estonian
laws over those of the Soviet Union. [ 65 ] In March 1990, the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the
Lithuanian SSR declared independence , followed by the Georgian Supreme Soviet in April
1991. Although the symbolic right of the republics to secede was nominally guaranteed by the
constitution and the union treaty, [ 32 ] Soviet authorities at first refused to recognize it.
After the August coup attempt, most of the other republics followed suit. The Soviet Union
ultimately recognized the secession of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on 6 September 1991.
The remaining republics were recognized as independent with the Soviet Union's final
dissolution in December 1991. [ 66 ] # Republic Map of the Union Republics between

The Soviet Union became the first country to adopt a planned economy , whereby production and
distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government. The first Bolshevik
experience with a command economy was the policy of War Communism , which involved
nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of
agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money, as well as
private enterprises and free trade . As it had suffered a severe economic collapse caused by
the war, in 1921, Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP), legalizing
free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses. The economy quickly recovered. [ 67 ]

Following a lengthy debate among the members of Politburo over the course of economic
development, by 1928â€“1929, upon gaining control of the country , Joseph Stalin
abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting forced collectivization of
agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation. Resources were mobilized for rapid
industrialization , which greatly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital
goods during the 1930s. [ 67 ] Preparation for war was one of the main driving forces behind
industrialization, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalistic world. [ 68 ] As a
result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial
power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II . [ 69 ] During the
war, the Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required
extensive reconstruction. [ 70 ]

By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively self-sufficient ; for most of the
period until the creation of Comecon , only a very small share of domestic products was traded
internationally. [ 71 ] After the creation of the Eastern Bloc , external trade rose rapidly.
Still the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a
state monopoly on foreign trade . [ 72 ] Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became
major import articles from around the 1960s. [ 71 ] During the arms race of the Cold War, the
Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful
bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry. At the same time, the Soviet Union became the
largest arms exporter to the Third World . Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the
Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states . [ 71 ]

From the 1930s until its collapse in the late 1980s, the way the Soviet economy operated
remained essentially unchanged. The economy was formally directed by central planning ,
carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans . In practice, however, the plans were
highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors. All key
economic decisions were taken by the political leadership. Allocated resources and plan
targets were normally denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods. Credit was
discouraged, but widespread. Final allocation of output was achieved through relatively
decentralized, unplanned contracting. Although in theory prices were legally set from
above, in practice the actual prices were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links
(between producer factories etc.) were widespread. [ 67 ]

A number of basic services were state-funded, such as education and healthcare. In the
manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defense were assigned higher priority than the
production of consumer goods . [ 73 ] Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were
often scarce, of poor quality and limited choice. Under command economy, consumers had
almost no influence over production, so the changing demands of a population with growing
incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices. [ 74 ] A massive unplanned
second economy grew up alongside the planned one at low levels, providing some of the goods and
services that the planners could not. Legalization of some elements of the decentralized
economy was attempted with the reform of 1965 . [ 67 ]

Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic
growth difficult to estimate precisely, [ 75 ] [ 76 ] by most accounts, the economy continued to
expand until the mid 1980s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet economy experienced
comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West. [ 77 ] However, after 1970, the
growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in
other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of increase in capital
was only surpassed by Japan). [ 67 ]

Overall, between 1960 and 1989, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was
slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries). [ citation needed ] According to
Stanley Fischer and William Easterly , growth could have been faster. By their calculation,
per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was considering
the amount of investment, education and population. The authors attribute this poor
performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union. [ 78 ] Steven Rosenfielde
states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of Stalin's despotism, and
while there was a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation. [ 79 ]

In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of
perestroika . His policies relaxed state control over enterprises, but did not yet allow it to
be replaced by market incentives, ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in production
output. The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues , started to
collapse. Prices were still fixed, and property was still largely state-owned until after
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [ 67 ] [ 74 ] For most of the period after World War II up to its
collapse, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world by GDP ( PPP ), [ 80 ] though in
per capita terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the First World countries. [ 81 ]

article: Energy policy of the Soviet Union

The need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s, [ 82 ] both per ruble of
gross social product and per ruble of industrial product. At the start, this decline grew very
rapidly, but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975. From 1975 and 1980, it grew even
slower, [ clarification needed ] only 2.6 percent. [ 83 ] David Wilson, a historian, believed
that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production by the end of the
century. His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse. [ 84 ] The USSR, in
theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2â€“2.5 percent during
the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields [ clarification needed ] . [ 85 ] However, the energy
sector faced many difficulties, among them the country's high military expenditure and
hostile relations with the First World (pre- Gorbachev era ). [ 86 ]

In 1991, the Soviet Union had a pipeline network of 82,000 kilometres (51,000 mi) for crude
oil and another 206,500 kilometres (128,300 mi) for natural gas. [ 87 ] Petroleum and
petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety
of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported. [
88 ] In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard
currency . [ 71 ] At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of
crude oil, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia . [ 89 ]

The Soviet Union placed great emphasis on science and technology within its economy, [ 90 ]
however, the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology, such as producing the world's
first space satellite , typically were the responsibility of the military. [ 73 ] Lenin
believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as
technologically backward as it was. Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin's
belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations. By 1989,
Soviet scientists were among the world's best-trained specialists in several areas, such as
energy physics , selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding and military
technologies. Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy , the Soviets remained far behind
technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the First World .

Project Socrates , under the Reagan administration , determined that the Soviet Union
addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different
from what the US was using. In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for
indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both
the private and public sectors. In contrast, the Soviet Union was offensively and
defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to
increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology, while
preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage. However, in addition, the Soviet
Union's technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric
manner that greatly hindered its flexibility. It was this significant lack of flexibility
that was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its
reform. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ]

Soviet-era flag of Aeroflot

Transport was a key component of the nation's economy . The economic centralization of the
late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably
the establishment of Aeroflot , an aviation enterprise . [ 94 ] The country had a wide variety of
modes of transport by land, water and air. [ 87 ] However, due to bad maintenance, much of the
road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward
compared to the First World. [ 95 ]

Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world; [ 95 ] it was also
better developed than most of its Western counterparts. [ 96 ] By the late 1970s and early
1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of
the burden from the railways and to improve the Soviet state budget . [ 97 ] The road network and
automobile industry [ 98 ] remained underdeveloped, [ 99 ] and dirt roads were common outside
major cities. [ 100 ] Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few
roads the country had. By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the
road problem by ordering the construction of new ones. [ 100 ] Meanwhile, the automobile
industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction. [ 101 ] The underdeveloped road
network led to a growing demand for public transport. [ 102 ]

Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with
problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad
decision-making. Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport
infrastructure and services.

The Soviet merchant fleet was one of the largest in the world. [ 87 ]

population of the USSR (red) and the post-Soviet states (blue) from 1961 to 2009.

The first fifty years of the 20th century in tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union were marked by a
succession of disasters, each accompanied by largeâ€“scale population losses.
Excess deaths over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar
famine ) amounted to a combined total of 18 million, [ 103 ] some 10 million in the 1930s, [ 20 ] and
more than 26 million in 1941â€“5. The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million
smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued. [ 25 ]

The crude birth rate of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974,
largely due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages. The crude
death rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well â€“ from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to
8.7 in 1974. In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and
Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union,
and in some cases even increased in the postâ€“World War II period, a phenomenon partly
attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the
southern republics. [ 104 ] Soviet Europe moved towards sub-replacement fertility , while
Soviet Central Asia continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level
fertility. [ 105 ]

The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of
mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also
prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country. [ 106 ] An analysis of
the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the
early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again. [ 107 ] The infant mortality rate
increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as largely
real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services. [ 108 ] The rises in both
adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet
government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet
demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until
the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve
into the real causes. [ 109 ]

Soviet pupils in Milovice , Czechoslovakia in 1985.

Before 1917, education was not free in the Russian Empire and was therefore either
inaccessible or barely accessible for many children from lower-class working and peasant
families. Estimates from 1917 recorded that 75â€“85 percent of the Russian population
was illiterate .

Anatoly Lunacharsky became the first People's Commissariat for Education of Soviet Russia.
At the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of
illiteracy. People who were literate were automatically hired as teachers. For a short
period, quality was sacrificed for quantity. By 1940, Joseph Stalin could announce that
illiteracy had been eliminated. In the aftermath of the Great Patriotic War, the country's
educational system expanded dramatically. This expansion had a tremendous effect. In the
1960s, nearly all Soviet children had access to education, the only exception being those
living in remote areas. Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible, making it
clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society. Education also
became important in creating the New Soviet Man . [ 110 ]

Only 20 percent of all applicants were accepted. The rest entered the labor market or learned a
skill at a vocational technical school or technicum [ dubious â€“ discuss ] . Students
from families of dubious political reliability were barred from higher education. [ 111 ] The
Brezhnev administration introduced a rule that required all university applicants to
present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary. [ 112 ] According to statistics
from 1986, the number of students per 10,000 population was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517
for the US. [ 113 ]

USSR geographic location of ethnicities

The Soviet Union was a very ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic
groups. The total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991. According to a 1990
estimate, the majority were Russians (50.78%), followed by Ukrainians (15.45%) and Uzbeks
(5.84%). [ 114 ]

All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation. The ethnicity of a person was chosen
at the age of sixteen [ 115 ] by the child's parents. If the parents did not agree, the child was
automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father. Partly due to Soviet policies, some of
the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the
Mingrelians of the Georgian SSR , who were classified with the linguistically related
Georgians . [ 116 ] Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in
by force. Russians, Belarusians , and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other
groups did not. With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, ethnic
antagonisms developed over the years. [ 117 ]

In 1917, before the Bolshevik uprising, health conditions were significantly behind the
developed countries. As Lenin later noted, "Either the lice will defeat socialism, or
socialism will defeat the lice". [ 118 ] The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by
the People's Commissariat for Health in 1918. Health care was to be controlled by the state and
would be provided to its citizens free of charge, this at the time being a revolutionary
concept. Article 42 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health
protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR. Before Leonid Brezhnev
became head of state, the healthcare system of the Soviet Union was held in high esteem by many
foreign specialists. This changed however, from Brezhnev's accession and Mikhail
Gorbachev 's tenure as leader, the Soviet health care system was heavily criticised for many
basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision. [ 119 ]
Minister of Health Yevgeniy Chazov , during the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union , while highlighting such Soviet successes as having the most doctors and
hospitals in the world, recognised the system's areas for improvement and felt that billions
of Soviet rubles were squandered. [ 120 ]

After the socialist revolution, the life expectancy for all age groups went up. This
statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist
system . These improvements continued into the 1960s, when the life expectancy in the Soviet
Union surpassed that of the United States. It remained stable during most years, although in
the 1970s, it went down slightly, possibly because of alcohol abuse . At the same time, infant
mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on this.
This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the
Asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest, while declining markedly in the
more developed European part of the Soviet Union. [ 121 ]

[ edit ] Language

Main article: Languages of the Soviet Union

The Soviet government headed by Vladimir Lenin gave small language groups their own writing
systems. [ 122 ] The development of these writing systems was very successful, even though
some flaws were detected. During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same
multilingual situation implemented similar policies. A serious problem when creating
these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other. [
123 ] When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication,
that language would attain "official language" status. There were many minority languages
which never received their own writing system; therefore their speakers were forced to have a
second language . [ 124 ] There are examples where the Soviet government retreated from this
policy, most notable under Stalin's regime, where education was discontinued in languages
which were not widespread enough. These languages were then assimilated into another
language, mostly Russian. [ 125 ] During the Great Patriotic War (World War II), some minority
languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy. [ 126 ]

As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union's many languages, Russian de facto functioned as
an official language as the "language of interethnic communication" ( Russian :
Ñ�Ð·Ñ‹Ðº
ÐŒÐµÐ¶ÐœÐ°Ñ†ÐžÐŸÐœÐ°Ð»ÑŒÐœÐŸÐ³ÐŸ
ÐŸÐ±Ñ‰ÐµÐœÐžÑ� ), but only assumed the de jure status as the official
national language in 1990. [ 127 ]

General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev makes a toast with Russian Orthodox clergymen and a rabbi
at a celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1977. Main article:
Religion in the Soviet Union

A.L. Eliseev writes that a meeting of the antireligious commission of the Central Committee
of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) took place on 23 May 1929 under the
Chairmanship of E. laroslavskii. There, believers in the country were estimated at 80
percent. It cannot be ruled out that this percentage was somewhat understated, to prove the
successfulness of the struggle with religion. [ 128 ]

Christianity and Islam had the greatest number of adherents among the Soviet state's
religious citizens. [ 129 ] Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians, with
Russia's traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the Soviet Union's largest Christian
denomination . About 90 percent of the Soviet Union's Muslims were Sunnis , with Shiites
concentrated in the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic . [ 129 ] Smaller groups included
Roman Catholics , Jews , Buddhists , and a variety of Protestant sects. [ 129 ]

Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire. The Russian Orthodox Church
enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out
official state functions. [ 130 ] The immediate period following the establishment of the
Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church, which the revolutionaries
considered an ally of the former ruling classes . [ 131 ]

In Soviet law, the "freedom to hold religious services" was constitutionally guaranteed,
although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the Marxist
spirit of scientific materialism . [ 131 ] In practice, the Soviet system subscribed to a
narrow interpretation of this right, and in fact utilized a range of official measures to
discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups. [ 131 ]

The 1918 Council of People's Commissars decree establishing the Russian Soviet Federative
Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as a secular state also decreed that "the teaching of religion in
all [places] where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden. Citizens may
teach and may be taught religion privately." [ 132 ] Among further restrictions, those
adopted in 1929, a half-decade into Stalin's rule, included express prohibitions on a range
of church activities, including meetings for organized Bible study . [ 131 ] Both Christian
and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s. By
1940, as many as 90 percent of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in
1917 were closed. [ 133 ]

Convinced that religious anti-Sovietism had become a thing of the past, the Stalin regime
began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s. [ 134 ] Soviet religious
establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during the Soviet war with
Nazi Germany . Amid other accommodations to religious faith, churches were reopened, Radio
Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and
Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius I of Moscow was held in 1943. [ 134 ] The general
tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths. [
135 ]

The Soviet establishment again clashed with the churches under General Secretary Nikita
Khrushchev 's leadership in 1958â€“1964, a period when atheism was emphasized in the
educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views. [ 134 ]
During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the
number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97. [ 136 ] The number of working mosques also
declined, falling from 1,500 to 500 within a decade. [ 136 ]

Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government, but churches,
synagogues, temples, and mosques were all given more leeway in the Brezhnev era . [ 137 ]
Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the Soviet government again warmed to the
point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of
the Red Banner of Labor . [ 138 ] A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20
percent of the Soviet population as "active religious believers." [ 139 ]

"Enthusiast's March", one of the most famous songs of the Soviet Union (from the 1930s era).

The culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR's 70-year
existence. During the first eleven years following the Revolution (1918â€“1929),
there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a
distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On
the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and
their work banned, for example Nikolay Gumilev (shot for conspiring against the Bolshevik
regime) and Yevgeny Zamyatin (banned). [ 140 ]

Walking the Streets of Moscow was an iconic Soviet film of the 1960s.

The government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some
traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers Maksim
Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time. Film, as a means of influencing a
largely illiterate society, received encouragement from the state; much of director Sergei
Eisenstein 's best work dates from this period.

Later, during Stalin's rule, Soviet culture was characterised by the rise and domination of
the government-imposed style of socialist realism , with all other trends being severely
repressed, with rare exceptions, for example Mikhail Bulgakov 's works. Many writers were
imprisoned and killed. [ 141 ]

Following the Khrushchev Thaw of the late 1950s and early 1960s, censorship was diminished.
During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed characterized by
conformist public life and intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art
forms were again permissible, with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical
work began to be produced. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for
instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned themselves with
problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. An underground dissident
literature, known as samizdat , developed during this late period. In architecture the
Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style
of Stalin's epoch.

In the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost
significantly expanded freedom of expression in the media and press. [ 142 ]

    http://www.jstor.org/stable/152635 . "The new evidence shows that administrative
    command planning and Stalin's forced industrialisation strategies failed in the 1930s
    and beyond. The economic miracle chronicled in official hagiographies and until
    recently faithfully recounted in Western textbooks has no basis in fact. It is the
    statistical artefact not of index number relativity (the Gerschenkron effect) but of
    misapplying to the calculation of growth cost prices that do not accurately measure
    competitive value. The standard of living declined during the 1930s in response to
    Stalin's despotism, and after a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into
    stagnation. Glasnost and post-communist revelations interpreted as a whole thus
    provide no basis for Getty, Rittersporn & Zemskov's relatively favourable
    characterisation of the methods, economic achievements and human costs of Stalinism.
    The evidence demonstrates that the suppression of markets and the oppression of vast
    segments of the population were economically counterproductive and humanly
    calamitous, just as anyone conversant with classical economic theory should have
    expected."
