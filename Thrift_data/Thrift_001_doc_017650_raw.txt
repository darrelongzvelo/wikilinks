Anna Kournikova



BIOGRAFI

Anna Sergeyevna Kournikova  ( Russian : 

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png
  Ð�ÐœÐœÐ° Ð¡ÐµÑ€Ð³ÐµÐµÐ²ÐœÐ°
ÐšÑƒ́Ñ€ÐœÐžÐºÐŸÐ²Ð° ; born 7 June 1981) is a  Russian  retired
professional tennis player. Her beauty and celebrity status made her one of the best known
tennis stars worldwide, despite her never winning a WTA singles title. At the peak of her fame,
fans looking for images of Kournikova made her name one of the most common search strings on
Google . [2] [3] [4] Although reaching No. 8 in the world in 2000, she never won a WTA Title in
singles. Kournikova's forte has been doubles, where she has at times been the  World No. 1
 player. With  Martina Hingis  as her partner, she won  Grand Slam titles  in 
Australia  in  1999  and  2002 . Based on their looks, Hingis and Kournikova referred to
themselves as the " Spice Girls  of Tennis". [5] Kournikova's professional tennis career
has been curtailed, and possibly ended, by serious back and spinal problems in the past
several years. She resides in  Miami Beach , Florida, [1]  and plays in occasional
exhibitions and in doubles for the  St. Louis Aces  of World Team Tennis . She was a new
trainer for season 12 of the television show  The Biggest Loser , replacing  Jillian
Michaels , but will not return for season 13. In addition to her tennis and television work,
Kournikova serves as a Global Ambassador for  Population Services International 's  Five
& Alive  program, which addresses health crises facing children under the age of five and
their families.

PERSONAL

Kournikova started dating pop star  Enrique Iglesias  in late 2001 (she appeared in his
video, "Escape"), and rumors that the couple had secretly married circulated in 2003 and
again in 2005. Kournikova herself has consistently refused to directly confirm or deny the
status of her personal relationships. But in May 2007,  Enrique Iglesias  was
(mistakenly, as he would clarify later) quoted in the  New York Sun  that he had no intention
of marrying Kournikova and settling down because they had split up. The singer would later
deny these rumors of "divorce" or simply separation. In June 2008, Iglesias told the  Daily
Star  that he had married Kournikova the previous year and that they are currently
separated. [29]  In an interview with  Graham Norton  in 2010, Kournikova confirmed that
she and Iglesias have been together for over eight years but have no plans to marry in the near
future. [ citation needed ] Kournikova and Iglesias have been in a long term relationship for
10 years now. [ citation needed ]  Enrique and Anna have invested in a $20 million home to be
built on a private island in Miami.

Goals

Iglesias has collaborated with songwriter  Guy Chambers  to write "Un Nuovo Giorno", the
lead single from  Andrea Bocelli 's first pop album. The song was later translated into
English as " First Day of My Life " and recorded by Spice Girl  Melanie C . The song has since gone
to become a huge hit throughout Europe, and peaked in the number one spot in numerous
countries. Iglesias also wrote the single " The Way " for  American Idol  runner up  Clay
Aiken . Four songs co-written by Iglesias appear on the UK band  The Hollies ' current album.
Many times Iglesias has said that should he ever retire, he wants to write and produce songs for
other artists. In 2010 Idol Allstars 2010 (Swedish Idol Series) released a song "All I Need Is
You" co-written by Iglesias with  Andreas Carlsson ,  Kalle EngstrÃ¶m  and  Kristian
Lundin . It went straight to  iTunes  #1.

In 2000, Iglesias co-produced an  off Broadway  musical called  Four Guys Named Jose and
Una Mujer Named Maria . In the musical, four Americans of Latin heritage possess a common
interest in music and meet and decide to put on a show. The show contained many references and
allusions to many classic and contemporary Latin and pop songs by the likes of  Carmen
Miranda ,  Selena ,  Richie Valens ,  Santana ,  Ricky Martin  and Iglesias himself.
Iglesias also developed an interest in acting, starring alongside  Antonio Banderas , 
Salma Hayek  and  Johnny Depp  in the  Robert Rodriguez  film  Once Upon a Time in
Mexico , in which he played the foul-mouthed gun-wielding Lorenzo. In 2007, he had guest
starred in the TV comedy  Two and a Half Men  as a carpenter/handyman. He says that he would
act again if given small roles that he could fit in between his musical commitments. He also
guest starred as Gael, an Argentinean guitar playing/surfer/massage therapist love
interest of Robin in season 3 of the CBS hit TV show  How I Met Your Mother . Iglesias also played
the part of an evil Roman emperor in an ambitious TV commercial for  Pepsi , which sponsored
his last world tour. He starred alongside  Britney Spears ,  BeyoncÃ© and  Pink , who
turn the tables on him in the commercial. He's also starred in commercials for Tommy Hilfiger,
Doritos and for Viceroy watches. Posted by

Career







Music career



1995–96:  Enrique Iglesias

On July 12, 1995, Iglesias released  Enrique Iglesias , a collection of light rock ballads,
including hits such as " Si TÃº Te Vas ", " Experiencia Religiosa ", and others. The record
sold half a million copies in its first week, a rare accomplishment then for an album recorded
in a language other than English, going Gold in  Portugal  within the first week of release,
and sold over a million copies in the next three months. [11] His song " Por Amarte " was included
in  Televisa 's  telenovela   Marisol , but with a twist: instead of  Por amarte darÃ­a
mi vida  (To love you, I'd give my life), the words were  Por amarte Marisol, morirÃ­a
 (To love you, Marisol, I'd die). The CD also yielded Italian and Portuguese editions of the
album, with most of the songs translated into those languages. Five singles released from
this album, such as "Por Amarte", " No Llores Por MÃ­ ", and " Trapecista " topped the
Billboard's Latin charts. The album went on to win Iglesias a  Grammy Award  for Best Latin
Pop Performance.

1997–99:  Vivir  and  Cosas Del Amor

http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.20wmf4/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png
Iglesias with  Ronald McDonald  in 1999, his  Cosas del Amor  tour was sponsored by
McDonald's. In 1997, Iglesias' star continued to rise with the release of  Vivir  ( To Live
), which put him up with other English language music superstars in sales for that year. The
album also included a cover version of the  Yazoo  song " Only You ", translated into Spanish
as "Solo en TÃ­". Three singles released from  Vivir  (" Enamorado Por Primera Vez ", "
SÃ³lo en Ti " and " Miente ") topped the Latin singles chart as well as those in several
Spanish-speaking countries. Along with his father and  Luis Miguel , Iglesias was
nominated for an  American Music Award in the first-ever awarded category of Favorite Latin
Artist. It was said beforehand that the elder Iglesias would walk out if he did not win the
award. Iglesias lost out to his father, but did perform the song " Lluvia Cae " at the event.
Insisting on playing stadiums for his first concert tour, that summer, Iglesias , backed by 
sidemen  for  Elton John ,  Bruce Springsteen  and Billy Joel , played to sold-out
audiences in sixteen countries. Beginning in  Odessa , Texas the tour went on to three
consecutive nights in Mexico's  Plaza de Toros , two consecutive nights at  Monterrey 's 
Auditorio Coca Cola  and two at the Estadio River Plate in  Buenos Aires , Argentina to over
130,000 people as well as 19 arenas in the U.S. [14] In 1998, Iglesias released his third
album,  Cosas del Amor  ( Things of Love ). Taking a more mature musical direction, the
album, aided by the popular singles " Esperanza " and " Nunca Te OlvidarÃ© ", both of which
topped the Latin singles chart, helped cement his status in the Latin music scene. Iglesias
did a short tour of smaller venues to accompany the release of the album, with one show being
televised from  Acapulco , Mexico. This was followed by a larger world tour of over eighty
shows in even bigger venues. The  Cosas del Amor  Tour was the first ever concert tour
sponsored by  McDonald's . He won an American Music Award in the category of Favorite Latin
Artist against  Ricky Martin  and  Los Tigres del Norte . The song "Nunca te OlvidarÃ©"
was also used as the theme music for a Spanish soap opera of the same name and he sang the song
himself on the last episode of the series.

1999–2000:  Enrique

By 1999, Iglesias had begun a successful crossover career into the English language music
market. Thanks to other successful crossover acts, most notably that of  Ricky Martin and 
Selena , Latino artists and music had a great surge in popularity in mainstream music. After
attending one of his concerts  Will Smith  asked Iglesias to contribute to the soundtrack
of his movie  Wild Wild West , his contribution "Bailamos" was released as a single and became
a number one hit in the US. After the success of " Bailamos ", several mainstream record labels
were eager to sign Iglesias. Signing a multi-album deal after weeks of negotiations with 
Interscope , Iglesias recorded and released his first full CD in English,  Enrique . The pop
album, with some Latin influences, took two months to complete. It contained the song 
Rhythm Divine , a duet with  Whitney Houston  entitled " Could I Have This Kiss Forever ", and
a cover of the  Bruce Springsteen  song " Sad Eyes ". In 2000 Iglesias performed at the 
Superbowl  halftime show with  Christina Aguilara . Shock jock  Howard Stern
 repeatedly played a tape of a supposedly very off-key Iglesias on his radio show and accused
the Iglesias of not being able to sing live. On June 8th 2000 Iglesias sang the song live on
Stern's show with just a guitar accompanying him. After the performance Stern remarked "I
respect you for coming in here; you really can sing". [15]  Iglesias would remark that the
controversy was the best promotion he could have. The album's single  Be With You  became
Iglesias's second #1 single on Billboard's Hot 100.

2001–02:  Escape

In 2001 Iglesias released his second English language album  Escape . Where most of the Latin
crossover acts of the previous year experienced some difficulty matching the record sales of
their first English language albums, Iglesias actually went on to sell even more. The album's
first single, " Hero ", became a number one hit in the United Kingdom, and in many other
countries. The entire album was co-written by Iglesias. Escape  is his biggest commercial
success to date. The singles " Escape " and " Don't Turn Off The Lights " became radio staples,
fairing well and placing highly or topping various charts both in North America and
elsewhere. A second edition of the album was released internationally and contained a new
version of one of Iglesias's favorite tracks, " Maybe ", as well as a duet with  Lionel Richie
 called " To Love a Woman ". Iglesias capitalized on the album's success with his "One-Night
Stand World Tour" consisting of 50 sold-out shows in 16 countries. Including  Radio City
Music Hall  and three consecutive nights in London's  Royal Albert Hall , the tour ended
with a big show at  Stadium National Lia Manoliu  in  Bucharest , Romania. The concert
launched MTV Romania, with the video for " Love to See You Cry " being the first to be shown on the
channel. The second leg of the tour, " Don't Turn Off The Lights ", was completed in the summer of
2002, with two sold-out nights in  Madison Square Garden  and another two in Mexico's
National Auditorium . The tour finished with a single show in the  Roberto Clemente Coliseum
 in  San Juan ,  Puerto Rico .

2002–04:  QuizÃ¡s  &  7

In 2002, Iglesias chose to release a fourth Spanish-language album titled  QuizÃ¡s  (
Perhaps ). A more polished musical production than his previous Spanish albums and
containing more introspective songs, the album's title track is a song about the strained
relationship Iglesias has with his famous father. The album debuted at number 12 on the 
Billboard  200  albums chart, the highest placement of a Spanish language album on the
chart at the time.  QuizÃ¡s  sold a million copies in a week, making it the
fastest-selling album in Spanish in 5 years. The three singles released from the album all
ended up topping the Latin chart, giving Iglesias a total of 16 number ones on the chart. He
currently holds the record for the most number one singles on  Billboard 's Latin Chart. His
last single from the album, "Para Que la Vida", reached a million spins on U.S. radio, the only
Spanish language song to do so. [16] The video to the song "QuizÃ¡s" was the first Spanish
language music video to be added to the selection on one of  MTV's  popular show  Total
Request Live . Iglesias performed the song on  The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , becoming the
first to sing a Spanish song on the show, and opening doors for other artists such as  Ricky
Martin ,  Juanes  and  Jorge Drexler  to perform their Spanish material. Iglesias
included songs from  QuizÃ¡s  in his "Don't Turn Off the Lights Tour", and the album went
on to win a  Latin Grammy Award  for  Best Pop Vocal Album . By 2003 Iglesias released his
seventh album, which he called  7 , the second to be co-written by Iglesias. Among its more
1980s-inspired material, it features the song "Roamer", which he wrote with his friend and
longtime guitarist,  Tony Bruno . The CD also contained the song "Be Yourself", a song about
independence (the chorus talks about how Iglesias' own parents did not believe he'd ever
succeed in his singing career). The first single was the song " Addicted ", and was followed
closely by a remix of the song "Not in Love", featuring  Kelis . With this album, Iglesias went
on his biggest world tour to date. The highly publicised tour started with twelve shows in the
United States ending with Iglesias playing at  Houston Rodeo  and continued on to several
countries, most of which he'd never previously visited playing to sold-out arenas and
stadiums in Australia, India, Egypt and Singapore before ending his tour in  South Africa .

2007–08:  Insomniac

Iglesias performing on August 29, 2007. Iglesias released his new album  Insomniac  on
June 12, 2007. The album was so named due to it being recorded mainly at night. The album
contained a more contemporary pop style than that of previous albums. The album's highlights
include " Push ", with rapper  Lil' Wayne , as well as "Ring My Bells", and a cover of  Ringside
's " Tired of Being Sorry ". The first single " Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song) " was released on
April 10, 2007. It was the Iglesias's highest charting song on the Hot 100 since "Escape" it was
also a hit throughout Europe peaking in the top 10 in many countries and the Spanish version
entitled "DÃ­melo" was #1 on Hot Latin Tracks for 12 weeks becoming his second best
performing song on that chart. Iglesias followed up with the ballad " Somebody's Me ", which
was released as a single in the American continent. The song was played extensively on AC radio
and peaked high on Billboard's  Hot AC , where the Spanish version also performed well. In
Europe, the second single was "Tired of Being Sorry", which performed well in many countries;
he recorded a version of the song with French singer  NÃ¢diya which was #1 in France for
eleven weeks. On July 4, Enrique Iglesias became the first Western artist to play a concert in
Syria in three decades when he performed for a sold-out crowd of 10,000 in the capital [Damas]
and in the same week performed on  Live Earth  in [Hamburg]. The Insomniac World Tour was
launched at the  Dome  in  Johannesburg , South Africa, the same venue he ended his last
world Tour and took him to sold out arenas throughout Europe. It was his first arena tour of the
UK with him playing venues such as Manchester's  MEN Arena  and  Wembley Arena . The tour
ended with Iglesias performing at newly opened  L.A. Live . A second leg of the tour has taken
him throughout Latin America from Mexico to Argentina. A solo version of "Push" was added to
the soundtrack of the movie  Step Up 2 the Streets . The song was regarded as the third single
from the album. A music video was shot which features the film's lead actors. Despite never
being officially added to radio the song has charted in several countries and is one of his most
highly rated songs amongst fans. Iglesias's song " Can You Hear Me " has been chosen as the
official song of the  UEFA Euro 2008  football tournament. [17]  He performed the song
live at the June 29, 2008 final in Vienna, Austria. [18]  The song featured on a re-issue of the
Insomniac album being released in certain countries.

2008–09:  Greatest Hits  albums

Iglesias released a Spanish  Greatest Hits  album on March 25, 2008 which included his
seventeen #1 songs on Hot Latin Tracks chart, plus two new songs. The first single was the song

Iglesias's 18th #1 single on  Billboard ' s Hot Latin Songs. The album debuted at #1 on 
Billboard ' s Latin Albums Chart and #18 on the overall  Billboard  200 albums chart. It was
Iglesias's second Spanish album to debut in the top 20 of the  Billboard  200 ( QuizÃ¡s
 debuted at #12 in 2002). The album was certified double Platinum (Latin field) in the U.S.
and in some Latin American countries. The album's second single " Lloro Por Ti " had an official
