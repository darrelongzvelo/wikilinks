Ball State University ,Â located in Muncie , Indiana , has a campus spanning more than
1,000Â acres. The student body consists of 20,000 students, of which 18,000 are
undergraduate students and 1,500 are graduate students. Ball State has seen a trend of
near-constant growth since its creation and current enrollment is the highest in the
school’s history. Bachelor’s degrees are available in eight different areas which
contain over one hundred and fifty individual programs â€“ a sharp increase from the
five degree programs initially offered by the University. Ball State’s academic future is
considered by many to be bright as the University continues a course of upgrading programs and
adding new ones where applicable. A 2005 survey conducted by Intel Corporation rates Ball
State as the number one wireless campus in the nation.

The university’s entrepreneurship program has been ranked in the top five of all colleges
for its undergraduate entrepreneurship program for the last three years in a row, according
to the U.S. News & World Report magazine. According to the 2006 edition of the same magazine,
Ball State has one of the best undergraduate business programs in the nation. In 2004 “This
Business of Broadcasting” named Ball State as one of the nation’s top broadcasting
programs in the country. The 2005 edition ofÂ  Almanac of Architecture and Design named
Ball State one of the top ten colleges in landscape architecture. The BSU School of Music is
widely known for its quality at both the undergraduate and graduate levels; the school’s
Music Technology program houses one of the most elite facilities in the United States. In
addition, the music education division has long been recognized as one of the best music
teacher training programs in the Midwest. In 2006, Planetizen.com ranked Ball State’s
Urban Planning & Development program the seventeenth best in the country. It was also ranked
in the following areas: number seven in historic preservation, number seven in land-use
planning, number six in technology, number five in zoning administration, and number three
in the Midwest. In 2004, Ball State’s master’s program in Student Affairs
Administration in Higher Education (SAAHE) ranked 14th among 186 programs in a national
study presented to the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA).

Ball State competes in the NCAA Division I / IA and is part of the Mid-American Conference (MAC)
in all sports except for men’s volleyball , where it competes in the Midwestern
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA). Several professional athletes
participated in Ball State sports before turning pro. They include NFL players such as Reggie
Hodges , a punter drafted in 2005 by the St. Louis Rams ; Blaine Bishop , formerly of the
Tennessee Titans ; Brad Maynard , a punter with the Chicago Bears ; Bernie Parmalee , formerly
of the Miami Dolphins and current tight ends coach at the University of Notre Dame ; Dante
Ridgeway , a wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints , and Ed Konopasek, formerly of the Green
Bay Packers . NBA stars Theron Smith of the Charlotte Bobcats and Bonzi Wells of the New Orleans
Hornets competed on the NCAA level at Ball State as did Major League Baseball players,
including Larry Bigbie of the Los Angeles Dodgers , Bryan Bullington , pitcher for the
Pittsburgh Pirates , and Thomas Howard (“Tank”), formerly of the San Diego Padres ,
Cincinnati Reds , and several other major league teams. Nate Davis , a former standout
quarterback on the Ball State football team, was drafted in 2009 by the San Francisco 49ers.

Many Ball State graduates have gained regional, national and international attention,
including U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs and former United
States Ambassador to Lebanon , Jeffrey D. Feltman . Ball State graduates have particularly
left their mark in the fields of American professional sports and popular entertainment.
Perhaps the most recognizable alumnus of Ball State is American television host , David
Letterman , of Late Show with David Letterman on CBS. He is joined by fellow television
performers, Joyce DeWitt , who played Janet Wood in the 1970s sitcom Three’s Company , and
Anthony Montgomery , who played Travis Mayweather on Star Trek: Enterprise on UPN . Andy
Devine, character actor and comic cowboy side kick Oct 7 1905 – Feb 18 1977 played football at
the university.

Many alumni from the Miller College of Business have gone on to successful business careers
like Kent C. Nelson , Retired President and CEO, United Parcel Service and John Schnatter ,
Founder and Chairman of Papa John’s Pizza restaurants. In the field of comics , artist Jim
Davis , the cartoonist creator of Garfield also is a graduate of Ball State.

Announced by President Jo Ann M. Gora , alongside Indiana Senator Richard Lugar , at the Spring
2009 Commencement ceremony, Ball State plans for the nation’s largest geothermal energy
project. Over the next decade, a series of 4,000 boreholes (each 400 feet deep) will be placed
at various locations around the campus to allow the campus’s 40 buildings to be heated and
cooled via the use of heated and cooled waters. The first well field, containing nearly 1800
boreholes, began in July 2009.
