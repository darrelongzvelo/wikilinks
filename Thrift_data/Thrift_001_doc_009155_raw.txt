    Cthulhu is a cosmic entity created by horror author H. P. Lovecraft in 1926, first
    appearing in the short story " The Call of Cthulhu " when it was published in Weird Tales in
    1928. Cthulhu is one of the central Great Old Ones of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos . It
    is often cited for the extreme descriptions given of its hideous appearance, its
    gargantuan size, and the abject terror that it evokes. Cthulhu is often referred to in
    science fiction and fantasy circles as a tongue-in-cheek shorthand for extreme horror
    or evil.

After its first appearance in "The Call of Cthulhu", Cthulhu makes a few minor appearances in
other of Lovecraft's works. [1] August Derleth , a correspondent of Lovecraft's, used the
creature's name to identify the system of lore employed by Lovecraft and his literary
successors, the Cthulhu Mythos.

Spelling and pronunciation

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



Cthulhu has also been spelled as Tulu, Clulu, Clooloo, Cthulu, Cighulu, Cathulu, Kutulu,
Qâ€™thulu, Ktulu, Kthulhut, Kulhu, Thu Thu, [2] and in many other ways. It is often
preceded by the epithet Great, Dead, or Dread.

Lovecraft transcribed the pronunciation of Cthulhu as "KhlÃ»l'-hloo"
(/kÉ™ËˆÎžuË�luË�/). [3] S. T. Joshi points out, however, that Lovecraft gave
several differing pronunciations on different occasions. [4] According to Lovecraft, this
is merely the closest that the human vocal apparatus can come to reproducing the syllables of
an alien language. [5] Long after Lovecraft's death, the pronunciation kÉ™-THOO-loo
(/kÉ™ËˆÎžuË�luË�/) became common, and the game Call of Cthulhu endorsed it.

The Call of Cthulhu

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The most detailed descriptions of Cthulhu in "The Call of Cthulhu" are based on statues of the
creature. One, constructed by an artist after a series of baleful dreams, is said to have
"yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus , a dragon , and a human caricature.... A pulpy,
tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings." [6] Another,
recovered by police from a raid on a murderous cult, "represented a monster of vaguely
anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly,
rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings
behind." [7]

When the creature finally appears, the story says that the "thing cannot be described," but it
is called "the green, sticky spawn of the stars", with "flabby claws" and an "awful squid-head
with writhing feelers." The phrase "a mountain walked or stumbled" gives a sense of the
creature's scale. [8]

Cthulhu is depicted as having a worldwide cult centered in Arabia , with followers in regions
as far-flung as Greenland and Louisiana . [9] There are leaders of the cult "in the mountains of
China " who are said to be immortal . Cthulhu is described by some of these cultists as the "great
priest" of "the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young
world out of the sky." [10]

The cult is noted for chanting its horrid phrase or ritual: " Ph'nglui mglw'nafh C'thulhu
R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn ," which translates as "In his house at R'lyeh dead C'thulhu waits
dreaming." [11] This is often shortened to "C'thulhu fhtagn," which might possibly mean
"C'thulhu waits," "C'thulhu dreams," [12] or "C'thulhu waits dreaming." [13]

    One cultist, known as Old Castro , provides the most elaborate information given in
    Lovecraft's fiction about Cthulhu. The Great Old Ones, according to Castro, had come
    from the stars to rule the world in ages past.

        " They were not composed altogether of flesh and blood. They had shape...but that
        shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plunge from world
        to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But
        although They no longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone
        houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a
        glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for Them.
        "

    

        ―Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu," p. 140.

    



    Castro points to the "much-discussed couplet" from Abdul Alhazred 's Necronomicon :

        That is not dead which can eternal lie.

    

        And with strange aeons even death may die. [14]

    



    Castro explains the role of the Cthulhu Cult: When the stars have come right for the Great
    Old Ones, "some force from outside must serve to liberate their bodies. The spells that
    preserved Them intact likewise prevented them from making an initial move." [15] At the
    proper time,

        " the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from his tomb to revive His subjects and
        resume his rule of earth....Then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones;
        free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men
        shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach
        them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would
        flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. "

    

        ―Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu," p. 141.

    



Castro reports that the Great Old Ones are telepathic and "knew all that was occurring in the
universe." They were able to communicate with the first humans by "moulding their dreams,"
thus establishing the Cthulhu Cult, but after R'lyeh had sunk beneath the waves, "the deep
waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass, had cut off the
spectral intercourse." [16]

Star-spawn of Cthulhu

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The star-spawn of Cthulhu, or Cthulhi, have a physical similarity with Cthulhu himself, but
are of far smaller size. This race arrived with him, but relatively little is known about them.
On Earth they built the city R'lyeh, which later sank in the ocean, and where they still dwell
with Cthulhu. A few are rumored to have escaped this incident, and can be found in hidden places
on Earth.

In "At the Mountains of Madness" the "Spawn of Cthulhu" wage a great war against the Elder
Things after arriving on Earth. (See below).

Elsewhere in Lovecraft's fiction

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



Cthulhu is mentioned elsewhere in Lovecraft's fiction, sometimes described in ways that
appear to contradict information given in "The Call of Cthulhu". For example, rather than
including Cthulhu among the Great Old Ones, a quotation from the Necronomicon in " The Dunwich
Horror " says of the Old Ones, "Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly."
[17] But different Lovecraft stories and characters use the term "Old Ones" in widely
different ways.

    In At the Mountains of Madness , for example, the Old Ones are a species of
    extraterrestrials , also known as Elder Things , who were at war with Cthulhu and his
    relatives or allies. Human explorers in Antarctica discover an ancient city of the Elder
    Things and puzzle out a history from sculptural records:

        " With the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific tremendous events began....
        Another race--a land race of beings shaped like octopi and probably corresponding
        to the fabulous pre-human spawn of Cthulhu--soon began filtering down from cosmic
        infinity and precipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the Old Ones wholly
        back to the sea.... Later peace was made, and the new lands were given to the Cthulhu
        spawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older lands.... [T]he antarctic
        remained the centre of the Old Ones' civilization, and all the discoverable cities
        built there by the Cthulhu spawn were blotted out. Then suddenly the lands of the
        Pacific sank again, taking with them the frightful stone city of R'lyeh and all the
        cosmic octopi, so that the Old Ones were once again supreme on the planet.... "

    

        ― Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness , in At the Mountains of Madness , p. 66.

    



The narrator of At the Mountains of Madness also notes that "the Cthulhu spawn...seem to have
been composed of matter more widely different from that which we know than was the substance of
the Antarctic Old Ones. They were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations
impossible for their adversaries, and seem therefore to have originally come from even
remoter gulfs of cosmic space.... The first sources of the other beings can only be guessed at
with bated breath." He notes, however, that "the Old Ones might have invented a cosmic
framework to account for their occasional defeats." [18] Other stories have the Elder
Things' enemies repeat this cosmic framework.

In " The Whisperer in Darkness ", for example, one character refers to "the fearful myths
antedating the coming of man to the earth - the Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu cycles - which are
hinted at in the Necronomicon ." That story suggests that Cthulhu is one of the entities
worshipped by the alien Mi-Go race, and repeats the Elder Things' claim that the Mi-Go share
his unknown material compositions. Cthulhu's advent is also connected, in some unknown
fashion, with supernovae: "I learned whence Cthulhu first came, and why half the great
temporary stars of history had flared forth." The story mentions in passing that some humans
call the Mi-Go "the old ones". [19]

" The Shadow Over Innsmouth " establishes that Cthulhu is also worshipped by the nonhuman
creatures known as Deep Ones . [20]

According to correspondence between Lovecraft and fellow author James F. Morton, Cthulhu's
parent is the deity Nug , itself the offspring of Yog-Sothoth and Shub-Niggurath. Lovecraft
includes a fanciful family tree in which he himself descends from Cthulhu via Shaurash-ho,
Yogash the Ghoul, K'baa the Serpent, and Ghoth the Burrower.

    August Derleth , a literary protÃ©gÃ© and founder of the publishing house that first
    printed Lovecraft's works, wrote several stories in the Cthulhu Mythos (a term he
    coined) that dealt with Cthulhu, both before and after Lovecraft's death. In "The Return
    of Hastur", written in 1937, Derleth proposes two groups of opposed cosmic entities,

        " the Old or Ancient Ones, the Elder Gods, of cosmic good , and those of cosmic evil ,
        bearing many names, and themselves of different groups, as if associated with the
        elements and yet transcending them: for there are the Water Beings, hidden in the
        depths; those of Air that are the primal lurkers beyond time; those of Earth,
        horrible animate survivors of distant eons. "

    

        ―August Derleth, "The Return of Hastur", The Hastur Cycle , Robert M. Price, ed.,
        p. 256.

    



According to Derleth's scheme, "Great Cthulhu is one of the Water Beings". Derleth indicated
that "the Water Beings oppose those of Air"--a departure from traditional elemental theory,
in which water and fire were opposed--and depicted Cthulhu as engaged in an age-old
arch-rivalry with a designated Air elemental, Hastur the Unspeakable , whom he describes as
Cthulhu's "half-brother". [21]

    Based on this framework, Derleth wrote a series of stories, collected as The Trail of
    Cthulhu , about the struggle of Dr. Laban Shrewsbury and his associates against Cthulhu
    and his minions, culminating, in "The Black Island" (1952), with the atomic bombing of
    R'lyeh, which Derleth has moved to the vicinity of Ponape . Derleth describes Cthulhu in
    that story as

        " a thing which was little more than a protoplasmic mass, from the body of which a
        thousand tentacles of every length and thickness flailed forth, from the head of
        which, constantly altering shape from an amorphous bulge to a simulacrum of a man's
        head, a single malevolent eye appeared. "

    

        ―August Derleth, "The Black Island", The Cthulhu Cycle , Robert M. Price, ed., p.
        83.

    



Derleth's interpretations are not universally accepted by enthusiasts of Lovecraft's
work, and indeed are criticized by many for injecting a stereotypical conflict between equal
forces of objective good and evil into Lovecraft's strictly amoral continuity. [22]

Edit



Cthulhu has served as direct inspiration for many modern artists and sculptors. Prominent
artists that produced renderings of this creature include Paul Carrick, Stephen Hickman ,
Kevin Evans, Dave Carson, Francois Launet and Ursula Vernon .

Multiple sculptural depictions of Cthulhu exist, one of the most noteworthy being Stephen
Hickman's Cthulhu Statue which has been featured in the Spectrum annual [23] and is exhibited
in display cabinets in the John Hay Library of Brown University of Providence. This statue of
Cthulhu often serves as a separate object of inspiration for many works, most recent of which
are the Cthulhu Worshiper Amulets [24] manufactured by a Russian jeweler. For some time,
replicas of Hickman's Cthulhu Statuette were produced by Bowen Designs .
