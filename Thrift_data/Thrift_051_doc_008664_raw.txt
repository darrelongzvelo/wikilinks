Hi Everyone. Let's Begin...

Arizona Ballet Theatre's Nutcracker In the Land Of Sweetsâ„¢ Page

- Yes, This One -

Tells The Story, and Describes the Action On Stage



We shall start with an Overview that orients you in time and place,

That's followed by a Brief Summary or Synopsis of The Nutcracker Ballet's story line.

Then, we quickly go over Our Nutcracker party format, which is like a real performance, with
the dancing first and the refreshments afterward.

After that, we will introduce the Parts, or Roles. It's like the Cast of Characters they show
onscreen at the beginning of a movie.

Then we will show the Structure of the Ballet. It's like a Table of Contents, so you will always
know what's coming next.

We round that out with The Story of The Nutcracker Ballet, With Photos and Videos. It's fun, and
you'll know what to watch for in the real live performance, or in a DVD of a performance of The
Nutcracker Ballet. Now, let's begin...



Overview of The Nutcracker In The Land Of The Sweets Balletâ„¢ The Nutcracker Ballet
tells, and dances, a delightful story that has captured the imagination of children
everywhere. And, children do a have a way of becoming adults who still love the "The
Nutcracker."

The wonderful music by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky is some of the greatest ballet music ever
written. Tchaikovsky's melodies are soaring and magnificent. and his instrumentation
(e.g, the his use of the Celesta) was simply magical. Fortunately Tchaikovsky had a superb
vision, a sense, of the needs of ballet, so his music is danceable. With the right
choreography, it can be danced by Dancers of all ages, and it makes them all shine. Making that
happen on stage is part of Arizona Ballet Theatre's Magic In The Land of The Sweets.

The Nutcracker is a Fairy Tale - Ballet in two acts, or three tableaus. The music is by Pyotr
Ilyich Tchaikovsky, composed in 1891â€“92. Alexandre Dumas PÃšre's (The Father's)
adaptation of the original story - "The Nutcracker and the Mouse King" by E.T.A. Hoffmann - was
set to music by Tchaikovsky. The ballet was first choreographed by The French Dancer and
Teacher, Marius Petipa, and was commissioned by the director of the Russian Imperial
Theatres, Ivan Vsevolozhsky, in 1891.

The music for the Nutcracker ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, was composed in
1891â€“92.

To give you a sense of where this great work of Ballet Theatre Art sits in all our families' time
scales, and our country's time scale, consider this: Chic's Grandfather Leon Bramson was
about 26 years old when Nutcracker was first performed in Russia. The United States Civil War
had concluded 26 years before the ballet was commissioned. In just 17 more years, on September
27th, 1908, Model T Ford's, Tin Lizzie's, would start rolling off the assembly lines in
Detroit. So in a very real sense, this ballet was born and grew up with our families, and with our
automobiles. The Nutcracker Ballet really became popular in this country starting in the
nineteen sixties. That's when your parents - if you are a young ballet student - were not much
older than you are now. Or something like that.

In Western countries, this ballet has become perhaps the most popular ballet of all time, and
is performed primarily around Christmas and Hannukah time.





Here's A Brief Summary Of The Nutcracker Story.

It's Also Called A Synopsis of The Story

This particular synopsis appeared in the Boston Ballet Company's Nutcracker flyer we bought
in the lobby in 1994. The author was Paula Tully Gold. The copyrights are hers, The Selig Group,
and The Boston Ballet. The performance was choreographed beautifully by Bruce Marks who was
the Artistic Director at that time...



Boston Ballet's Story of The Nutcracker

ON A SNOWY CHRISTMAS EVE in Germany, townspeople are bustling with activity as they prepare
for the holiday. At the Silberhaus home an elaborate feast is about to begin. Young Clara
Silberhaus and her brother fritz eagerly await the arrival of the guests. Fritz, a
mischievous, naughty boy is teasing his sister when Grandfather, Grandmother, and all the
young cousins begin filling the house with joyful tidings and gifts.

(2) A STRANGE MAN wearing a patch over one eye suddenly appears with a flourish of his black,
billowing cape. It is Dr. Drosselmeyer. the children's beloved godfather. He delights ll the
guests with his magical creations, but he surprises Clara with a special gift - a wooden
nutcracker soldier! Fritz tugs at his sister's toy untilâ€ŠSNAP! To Clara's dismay, the
nutcracker breaks. Dr. Drosselmeyer handily mends it with his kerchief. Soon afterward the
party ends and all are off to bed.

(3) LATER THAT NIGHT Clara tiptoes into the parlor where her nutcracker rests beneath the
twinkling Christmas tree. She is unaware that Dr. Drosselmeyer has cast an enchanted spell
over the room. Right after hr eyes, the room grows in size and the Christmas tree soars up
through the ceiling and to the sky. Clara is filled with wonder and delight. Is it real or just a
dream?

(4) SUDDENLY THE MOUSE King and his band of rough raucous rodents invade the parlor.
Incredibly, the nutcracker springs to life and leads an army of toy soldiers in battle against
the evil mice. But the mice overpower the soldiers and the nutcracker falls into danger.
Thinking fast, Clara pulls off her slipper and hurls it at the Mouse King. A direct hit! The
soldiers win the battle.

(5) CLARA'S EYES WIDEN in amazement as the nutcracker is transformed into a real, living
Prince. He takes her hand and guides her out into the snowy night where a beautiful sleigh
awaits to carry them off to the Enchanted Forest. As they reach the icy wonderland, they are
greeted by shimmering, dancing snowflakes and the Snow King and Queen. A colorful balloon
descends with the snow, and Clara and the Prince are whisked away.

(6) CLARA AND THE PRINCE arrive at the Palace of Sweets, a magical place ruled by the Sugarplum
Fairy. A place brimming with exquisite sweets and treats. Charming dances are performed to
honor Clara's bravery against the Mouse king. Best of all, the Sugarplum Fairy and her
handsome Cavalier dance a romantic pas de deux. But as their dance ends, so does Clara's
adventure. The balloon rises into the sky and carries clara and the prince back through the
starry night.

The End



Our Party Has Dancing First and Sweets After

In the following sections, especially in the Synopsis Section, you will see the Nutcracker
Ballet itself starts with a party and moves on to more and more magnificent and charming
dancing after the party..

The plan or structure of our Nutcracker Land of the Sweetsâ„¢ Party is in the inverse
order!! We will have dancing first and the party afterward. That's the way a real world
performance operates! A lovely performance is usually followed by a
post-performance-party.



ABT's Nutcracker In the Land of the Sweetsâ„¢ Party is a WONDERFUL PHOTO OPPORTUNITY!!

We have lots of photos of interesting Nutcracker memorabilia and past performances. You have
seen a number of those in Miss Cecily's daily blogs. Now we want to add something special!
Something that is uniquely our very own in this moment in The Ongoing Story of the Ballet
Universe. We want to add photographs of our Nutcracker Dances and our "Nutcracker In the Land
Of Sweetsâ„¢ Party"!!!

Our Nutcracker In the Land of Sweetsâ„¢ Party is a WONDERFUL PHOTO OPPORTUNITY!!

So, please bring still and movie cameras and take lots of photos and video clips. Just do not
take flash photos of our wonderful Dancers while they are dancing, because that is not safe.
Safety Always Comes First!!! Yes, bring your cameras, on one condition, that you give us a CD or
email your work to us so we can post them here. Please tell us who your dancer is on the CD. We
guarantee you will be pleased with the results. Remember this is for fun. We do not expect you to
be a professional photog...

Next is the Story, but first...



Here are a few photos from last December's Arizona Ballet Theatre's "ABT Goes Nuts s 2010"
Nutcracker Party.

And now, on to the full story...



The Story of The Nutcracker Ballet, With Photos and Videos

This has pictures and videos to show what it's really like(;-) (;-)



The story has been published in many book versions including colorful children-friendly
versions. The plot revolves around a German girl named Clara Silberhaus, which means "silver
house." (In Hoffmann's tale, the girl's name actually is Marie or Maria, while Clara - or
"KlÃ€rchen" - is the name of one of her dolls.) Act I





Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Nutcracker_design.jpg

Konstantin Ivanov's original sketch for the set of The Nutcracker (1892)



Tableau I



The work opens with a brief "Miniature Overture", which also opens the Suite.

Aside: ... There is nothing miniature about it. It lasts a full four minutes, all of which, I had
to peek through a keyhole at the party preparations, and still keep the interest of the
audience. I had enough of that after four seconds!!!

The music sets the fairy mood by using upper registers of the orchestra exclusively. The
curtain opens to reveal the Silberhaus' house, where a Christmas Eve party is under way.
Clara, her little brother Fritz, and their mother and father are celebrating with friends and
family, when the mysterious godfather, Herr Drosselmeyer, enters. He quickly produces a
large bag of gifts for all the children. All are very happy, except for Clara, who has yet to be
presented a gift. Herr Drosselmeyer, who is a highly skilled clock and toy maker, then
produces two life-size dolls, Columbine and Harlequin, which each take a turn to dance. They
are two of the standard characters from the traditional Italian comic puppet shows known as
Comedia Dell ArtÃ©. It's delightful that they are also in the Nutcracker Ballet.

The third doll who, as you will soon see, comes out a bit later is The Nutcracker.

in Boston circa 1964.

When the dances are done, Clara approaches Herr Drosselmeyer asking for her gift. It would
seem that he is out of presents, and Clara runs to her mother in a fit of tears and
disappointment.

Godfather, Magician, Toy maker, Drosselmeyer then produces The Toy Nutcracker , in the
traditional shape of a soldier in full parade uniform. Clara is overjoyed, but her brother
Fritz is jealous, and quickly grabs and then breaks the Nutcracker.



Now here is Miss Cecily as the Last Female Fritz in The Boston Ballet Company's Nutcracker...

It was only a few years ago, the mere twinkling of heaven's eye!!!

This was Cecily's very first Nutcracker ever! At that time, Fritz and Clara opened the entire
production in front of a Scrim that depicted the locked door into the the large room where the
Party was about to be held. We spied in excitement through the keyhole as the audience enjoyed
the "Overture Miniature," conducted energetically by the late, great, Arthur Fiedller of
the world renowned Boston Pops.

As I mentioned earlier, the Overture is not Miniature!!!

Petersburg, 1892





The party ends and the Silberhaus family go to bed. While everybody is sleeping, Herr
Drosselmeyer repairs the Nutcracker. Then Clara wakes up and sees her window open. When the
clock strikes midnight, Clara hears the sound of mice. Clara has been shrinking. She wakes up
and tries to run away, but the mice stop her. Alternatively, perhaps Clara is still in a dream:
the Christmas tree suddenly begins to grow to enormous size, filling the room. It's really
Clara who is shrinking. But then she would be hard to see, so the tree grows instead. Now, The
Nutcracker comes to life, he and his band of soldiers rise to defend Clara, and the Mouse King
leads his mice into battle. Here Tchaikovsky continues the miniature effect of the Overture,
setting the battle music predominantly in the orchestra's upper registers.

A conflict ensues, and when Clara helps the Nutcracker by holding the Mouse King by the tail or
throwing her shoe at the Mouse King, the Nutcracker seizes his opportunity and stabs him. The
Mouse King dies. The mice retreat, taking their dead leader with them. The Nutcracker is then
transformed into a prince. (In Hoffmann's original story, and in the Royal Ballet's 1985 and
2001 versions, the Prince is actually Drosselmeyer's nephew, who had been turned into a
Nutcracker by the Mouse King, and all the events following the Christmas party have been
arranged by Drosselmeyer in order to break the spell.)



Tableau II



In A Forest In The Winter



Clara and the Prince travel to a world where dancing Snowflakes greet them and fairies and
queens dance, welcoming Clara and the Prince into their world.





Here is an old polaroid of Miss Cecily as a Snowflake In Act II of Boston Ballet Company's

This image was scanned from a very old Polaroid print taken during a Boston Ballet Performance
in the late sixties, I think. The color Poloroid camera had just been introduced. So this is one
of the earliest color photographs ever taken of a live ballet performance. It could even be the
very first one. (;-) The physical print is in terrible shape. It was in a box, so people picked it
up to look at it. It is very faded and loaded with wonderful fingerprints that are quite
dramatic! I think they are the Mouse King's paw prints. Quite scary!!! I have cleaned it up and
brightened it a lot. It's not perfect, but that's life.



The score conveys the wondrous images by introducing a wordless children's chorus.

Act II

Clara and the Prince arrive at the Land of the Sugar Plum Fairy. The Sugar Plum Fairy and the
people of the Land of Sweets dance for Clara and the Prince in the dances of Dew Drop Fairy, the
Spanish dancers (sometimes Chocolate), the Chinese dancers (sometimes Tea), the Arabian
dancers (sometimes Coffee), the Russian dancers (sometimes Candy Canes--their dance is
called the Trepak), Mother Ginger and her Polichinelles (sometimes Bonbons, Taffy Clowns,
or Court Buffoons in Baryshnikov's production), the Reed Flutes (sometimes Marzipan
shepherds or Mirlitons), the Sugar Plum Fairy, and the Waltz of the Flowers. The dances in the
Land of the Sugar Plum Fairy are not always performed in this order.

Wasn't that fun?



The Coda, also known as The Grand Finale!



Finally, the Sugar Plum Fairy and Her Cavalier lead everyone in the rousing Finale, which is
called The Coda, also known as The Grand Finale!



Here's a photo of The Coda, from of one of my childhood Nutcrackers when I studied at the Boston
Ballet's School, and danced with the Boston Ballet Company. The Coda typically starts off
with the individual groups of Dancers coming out, one group at a time, and Dancing to their own
musical themes. First the Chinese dancers come out, then Spanish, it varies, In all versions,
one by one, the groups of Dancers come out and dance to their own music.

Coda from Boston Ballet Company Nutcracker Performance in Boston circa 1964.

The above photo is of The Grand Finale at the end of The Coda. Everyone joins together at the end
of of Clara's visit to the Kingdom of the Sweets. It's the big rousing rally - Tada Tada Tada!!!
Sometimes Drosselmeyer does something special. Each choreographer plays with the story, so
there are lots of versions...





The Apotheosis, or How Things Wind Up... kind of like - Who Goes Where to Live Happily Ever
After?

The following number, after The Coda, is known as The Apotheosis It also has a number of
possible versions. in one version, after the festivities, Clara wakes up under the Christmas
tree or on the living room couch from a dream, with the Nutcracker toy in her arms and the curtain
closes. In another version, she goes up in a balloon, and the dream never ends. In Balanchine's
version also, she is never shown waking up; instead, after all the dances in the Kingdom of
Sweets have concluded, she rides off with the Nutcracker/Prince on a Santa Claus type Flying
Sleigh, complete with Reindeer, and the curtain falls. This gives the impression that the
"dream" actually happens in reality, as in Hoffmann's original story. The 1985 Royal Ballet
version seems to imply the same thing, since at the end, Drosselmeyer's nephew, who had really
been transformed into a Nutcracker, reappears in human form at the toymaker's shop.)





A Lovely Moment - Or Who Danced With Us In the Boston Ballet?

A lovely moment happened in our lobby, recently, which I want to share with you. It was a very
busy moment in the Lobby with many parents and dancers present. Two of my "tweenagers" swept
through the door, talking and moving, and when they saw me coming from the opposite direction,
posed the following question. "Miss Cecily, did you ever dance with Maria Tallchief?"

Amazingly, I was able to say, "yes!" My first appearance as a child with a professional ballet
company, The Boston Ballet, was as Fritz - yes, the naughty boy in the First Act Nutcracker
party, Clara's (underappreciated, in my opinion (;-) ) brother - while the dazzling Sugar
Plum Fairy was none other than the great American ballerina, Maria Tallchief. Her cavalier
was Conrad Ludlow, also guest starring from the New York City Ballet, where both were
principal dancers.

In this performance, in Act I, Miss Cecily was the last female Fritz.

In Act II, Miss Cecily was a Hoop, a Sugar Cane.







How Did We Pick "Nutcracker In The Land of the Sweetsâ„¢ For Our Nutcracker Event 2008?



Before we get into Tchaikovsky's music for the Nutcracker Ballet, let me quickly discuss how
we picked "Nutcracker In The Land of the Sweetsâ„¢ Ballet," as Arizona Ballet Theatre's
name For Our Nutcracker Party in December 2008...



First, you should know that...

Nutcracker Ballet Is Not About Nuts. It's About Candy and Other Sweets!!!

Everyone at Arizona Ballet Theatre knows that, currently, I am obsessing about the Candy
Related Storyline in the ballet, not the Party Related Psychological Sibling Issues between
Clara and Fritz Silberhaus.

Candy is such a wonderful treat; it doesn't surprise me in the least that the World's Most
Popular Ballet - The Nutcracker - is largely devoted to Candy . Where? in The Kingdom of the
Sweets, of course. The First Act does not have an obvious Candy Theme like the Second; however,
since it is about a Christmas Party, one can assume that Candy is involved. Hence, the First act
has A Subtext of Candy, a Promise of Candy, that presages the complete, total devotion to Candy
in the Second Act; Culminating in the Pas de Deux danced by the "Sugar Plum Fairy, Queen of the
Sweets." and her Dashing Cavalier. It's certainly not about the Nut Turtle Fairy and her
Dashing Cashew. Is it?

While some more serious minded Ballet critics may argue that The Nutcracker contains many
deeply psychological themes surrounding Clara's Dream, one can certainly make the case that
The Most Popular Ballet in the World is really about Candy!

As a sweet young student wrote, in her lovely handwriting, on the wonderful card she gave me for
my birthday...

Dear Miss Cecily,

You Are Sweeter Than Candy.

And, Everyone Loves Candy!



See, that says a lot. Everyone does love Candy. The most popular ballet of all time must be about
candy.

As Candy Monster Sings...

Candy Candy Candy is good enough for me,

It's good enough for me,

It's good enough for me!

Candy Candy Candy Starts With "C" !!!

It Is called "The Nutcracker," but is this ballet about Nuts at all? It's about "Gingerbread
Soldiers," and "Spanish Chocolate." It's about "Mother Ginger" and her Polichinelles, also
known as "Bonbons," and "Taffy Clowns." It's about "Marzipan Shepherds." or "Mirlitons"
(Louisiana French, toy reed flute, or "Tube-Shaped Pastry.")

I refuse to pretend it's about nuts, any longer. Where is "The Waltz of the Walnuts," for
example? Has anyone seen "The Pecan Pas de Deux"? Do the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Court do
Filbert Fouettes? I think not! Nutcracker is clearly about CANDY and CAKE! It's about SWEETS!
No IFS, ANDS, or "NUTS" about it!!

I am being a bit silly - it's the thoughts of Sugar Plums dancing in my head, perhaps. I just think
that it is very important to remember that... Life Should be Full of Candy, Pastries, and all
Things Sweet and Wonderful... Just Like Ballet. Don't you agree? I thought you would.

P.S. (in sotto vocce,) Psychologists really like candy too. Just don't tell anyone...





And now back to the our Nuts to the Sweets, and Sweets to the Nuts story... Let's talk about the
music...







Tchaikovsky's Music



Since you love or are interested in Ballet, and since you played the videos on this page, you
already are somewhat or very familiar with Tchaikovsky's ballet music. It is so exquisite, so
perfect, so dreamy and so exciting, isn't it. Now, you might be interested in hearing a bit
about how it came to be created at all. The Nutcracker wasn't his idea, he was asked to write the
music.

Marius Petipa, one of the Directors of the of the Imperial Ballet, which was sponsored by the
Czar of Russia, thought that a popular story by a famous German author would make a perfect
Christmas ballet. Petipa had choreographed two other ballets you may know of: Sleeping
Beauty and Swan Lake, and had worked with Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky before. So it was only
natural that he should ask Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to compose the music for The Nutcracker.
Petipa gave Tchaikovsky specific instructions to write a march, a Chinese dance, an Arabian
dance, a Russian dance, and so forth.

Today, most choreographers design dances to music that is already composed, but in the last
century, ballet music was usually â€œorderedâ€� by choreographers, with
instructions to write so many measures of music with a specific rhythm and tempo, and so many
measures of another rhythm and tempo. It is a mark of Tchaikovskyâ€™s genius that he
could write â€œon orderâ€� and produce some of the most beautiful music the world
has known. Tchaikovsky also wrote symphonies, piano music, the famous 1812 Overture, and
many other works. It is most likely in considerable part due to his ballet music, that he is
likely the best known classical composer in the world.

Among other things, the score of The Nutcracker is noted for its use of the Celesta, as the
featured solo instrument in the "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" from Act II. It is also used
elsewhere in the same act.

When Tchaikovsky was asked to write â€œfairy-like musicâ€� for the Sugar Plum
Fairy, he decided to use a new instrument, the Celesta, or Celeste , a new instrument
Tchaikovsky had discovered in Paris. for her dance. He wanted it to characterize the Sugar
Plum Fairy because of its "heavenly sweet sound". It appears not only in her "Dance", but also
in other passages in Act II. Tchaikovsky was proud of the celesta's effect. Everyone was
enchanted. We still are!!

There was no celeste in Russia at the time, so he sent friends to Paris (some say to Germany) for
one. They brought it back in secret, and it was kept hidden until time to perform the music,
because Tchaikovsky didnâ€™t want other composers to steal his idea before the
Nutcracker Ballet with his music was actually performed. He wanted its music performed
quickly for the public, before he could be "scooped" by his rival Rimsky-Korsakov in
particular.

Tchaikovsky also uses toy instruments during the Christmas party scene.

The music in Tchaikovsky 's ballet is some of the composer's most popular. The music belongs to
the Romantic Period and contains some of his most memorable melodies, several of which are
frequently used in television and film. (They are often heard in TV commercials shown during
the Christmas season .) The Trepak , or Russian dance , is one of the most recognizable pieces in
the ballet, along with the famous Waltz of the Flowers and March , as well as the ubiquitous
Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy . The ballet contains surprisingly advanced harmonies and a
wealth of melodic invention unsurpassed in ballet music. Nevertheless, the composer's
reverence for Rococo and late 18th century music can be detected in passages such as the
Overture, the "EntrÃ©e des parents", and "Tempo di Grossvater" in Act I.

Today and Everyday is Our Salute to Nutcracker Day! - Â¡El Dia del Nutcracker!

Naturally, I have been thinking quite a bit about the gorgeous Studio at the Stevie Eller
Theatre, since we will be dancing there sooner than you think. And, I have been
uncharacteristically interested in the entire "Nutcracker Score," rather than my usual
obsessing about "Snow", "Spanish", or "The Waltz of the Flowers." I have also accumulated
over the years many "Nutracker" musical excerpts and/or complete CD sets by different
orchestras, different conductors, variations on a theme of "Nutcracker" by Moe, Larry &
Curly, and the Techno Twins. Just kidding, but you know what I mean. Admit it. Sometimes it is
hard to delight in the sweet beauty of the Tchaikovsky score when media commercials with musak
renditions of "Trepak" or "Marzipan", chopped and buchered, are already appearing in shiny,
sparkly, riculously unrealistic ads by Halloween. It is easy to become a little jaded,
cynical, and bored when it comes to the commercialization of one of the most successful dance
phenomena of all time.

Instead, I find myself completely in the mood for Nutcracker. In fact, in last night's Barre, I
used ONLY Nutcracker music, something I have never ever done before. It was so much fun! I
intend to follow this Ballet Class thread until either YOU or I become sick of it...whichever
comes first.

So you have to actually tell me if it is simply "TOO MUCH NUTCRACKER!" which reminds me,
favorably, of The Berenstain Bears and that delightful series of illustrated children's
book. I feel myself getting pulled in a fun-filled exploration of the world's favorite
ballet, with a focus on the "Candy Aspects" of the story. To that end, here is a Perfectly Pink
photo from a Flickr photographer, with whom WebMaster Editor Chic interacts, that PERFECTLY
captures the Nutcracker Spirit, upside down AND from Nature.

Nutcracker Madness at Arizona Ballet Theatre Continues!

I love this time of year, but it is a little kooky.

Dance-wise, I am personally suffering from full-blown, Nutcracker Madness. Isn't that
wonderful? I have decided to allow my inner passion for Tchaikovsky to overtake me
completely. I love his melodies more than any other composers; what can I say? Once again this
year, his Nutcracker score has me in its thrall. That's no surprise since it remains The Most
Popular Ballet in the World. That is the Pointe (Yes it is a pun)!

Speaking of Pointe, here's an example of our newest Pointe Dancers Wowing the Audience at our
Spring 2008 performances in the Stevie Eller Theatre of "Classics 2008." The photo is called
"Our Newest Pointe Dancers Are a Huge Hit with the Crowd." Thanks to Jennifer Goralsky for this
Gorgeous capture of our Proud Precious Pointe Princesses...

weeks! Here is stylized creation to get you in the mood. We won't have this set completed for
this year, but perhaps as a backdrop...

Detailed History





The History of The Nutcracker Ballet

The Nutcracker Ballet is a holiday tradition, but how did it begin? Dance Channel TV provides a
colorful, detailed video history of the origins of the Nutcracker as we know it today.







Performance History



St. Petersburg Premiere

The first performance of the ballet was held as a double premiere together with Tchaikovsky's
last opera Iolanta on 18 December [ O.S. 6 December] 1892, at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in
St. Petersburg , Russia. Who exactly choreographed the first production has been debated.
Although Lev Ivanov is often credited, contemporary accounts credit Marius Petipa .

    

According to one version of the story, though Marius Petipa had planned to choreograph The
Nutcracker, he became ill and his assistant, Lev Ivanov, was asked to do the choreography.
Ivanov had already won acclaim for his choreography for parts of Swan Lake. (Petipa did the two
acts that take place in a palace, and Ivanov did the two acts that take place at the lake, with
dancers playing the parts of swans.) In The Nutcracker, Ivanov was limited by the story of the
first act to traditional choreography, but when Clara travels to the Land of Snows, Ivanov was
able to introduce a new type of movement, turning dancers into snowflakes, as he had earlier
turned dancers into swans. Similarly, in the Land of Sweets, Ivanov made each dance
characteristic of the nationality of the dancers (Spanish, Russian, and Chinese) or type of
sweets (for example, big, swirling movements for the flowers, and quick, tiny steps for the
Sugar Plum Fairy).

The ballet was conducted by Riccardo Drigo , with Antoinetta Dell-Era as the Sugar Plum Fairy,
Pavel Gerdt as Prince Coqueluche, Stanislava Belinskaya as Clara, Sergei Legat as the
Nutcracker-Prince, and Timofei Stukolkin as Drosselmeyer. [ 2 ]

In other countries

An abridged version of the ballet was first performed outside Russia in Budapest (Royal Opera
House) in 1927, with choreography by Ede Brada. [ citation needed ] The first complete
performance of the ballet outside Russia took place in England in 1934. [ 3 ] Its first complete
United States performance was in 1944, by the San Francisco Ballet , staged by its artistic
director Willam Christensen . [ 4 ] The New York City Ballet first performed George Balanchine
's staging of The Nutcracker in 1954. [ 5 ]





New choreography



Willam Christensen

It was not until 1944 that the first complete production in the U.S. took place, performed by
the San Francisco Ballet , and choreographed by Willam Christensen . The company was the first
in the U.S. to make the ballet an annual tradition, and for ten years, the only company in the
United States performing the complete ballet. The company performs it annually to this day.
The stage success of the Christensen version marked the first step in making productions of
The Nutcracker annual Christmas season traditions all over the world - a phenomenon that did
not really come to flower until the late 1960s. The San Francisco Ballet has recently taped a
new production choreographed by Helgi Thomasson , which has already been issued on DVD and is
scheduled to be telecast on PBS during the 2008 Christmas season.

    George Balanchine

        See also: List of New York City Ballet repertory

    



In 1954 George Balanchine followed in Christensen's footsteps by choreographing and
premiering his now-famous New York City Ballet version. Balanchine's Nutcracker has since
been staged in New York every year, performed live on television twice - although its first
television edition, on the TV anthology Seven Lively Arts , was severely abridged - and made
into a poorly received full-length feature film in 1993, starring Macaulay Culkin in his only
screen ballet role. In Balanchine's version, the roles of Clara (here called Marie) and the
Nutcracker are danced by children, and so their dances are choreographed to not be as
difficult as the ones performed by the adults.

Mikhail Baryshnikov

The popularity of the Balanchine Nutcracker could be said to have been seriously challenged,
however, by the highly acclaimed American Ballet Theatre version choreographed by and
starring Mikhail Baryshnikov , which premiered in 1976 at the Kennedy Center , was re-staged
for television and first telecast by CBS with limited commercial interruption in 1977, and is
now a TV holiday classic.

Baryshnikov omits the roles of the Sugar Plum Fairy and Prince Orgeat, and gives their dances
to Clara and the Nutcracker/Prince; so that in his version, the two do not merely sit out most of
the entire second act as they do in other productions (notably Balanchine's). In addition,
although the Mother Ginger and her Clowns music is heard, we never see Mother Ginger herself,
only four court clowns who perform the dance.

In Baryshnikov's version, contrary to what is often written, it is not Clara's brother Fritz
who breaks the Nutcracker, but an unnamed drunken guest at the Christmas party who is trying to
make the toy "grow" to life-size. He is last seen in "human" form tipsily leaving with the other
guests, but eventually becomes the Mouse King in Clara's dream.

The stage version of this production originally starred Baryshnikov, Marianna Tcherkassky
as Clara, and Alexander Minz as Drosselmeyer, However, for the TV version the role of Clara
went to Gelsey Kirkland , and it is Kirkland, not Tcherkassky, who has been widely seen in this
production of the ballet. Clara is considered one of Gelsey Kirkland's most memorable roles.

Except for Tcherkassky, the rest of the cast of this production also appeared in it on
television. The television version was not a live performance of the ballet, but a special
presentation shot on videotape in a TV studio (with no studio audience) in Toronto, Canada .

The Baryshnikov Nutcracker has since become both the most popular television version of the
work and a bestselling videocassette and DVD version of the ballet. It usually outsells not
only every other video version of The Nutcracker , including the 1993 film of Balanchine's
version, but every other ballet video as well. It is still telecast annually on some PBS
stations. In 2004, it was re-mastered and reissued on DVD with a markedly improved visual
image showing far greater detail and more vivid colors than before, as well as sound that, if
not present-day state-of-the-art, was far better than its original 1977 audio. It is only one
of two versions of the ballet to have been nominated for Emmys - the other was Mark Morris 's
intentionally exaggerated and satirical take on the ballet, The Hard Nut , telecast on PBS in
1992. ( Seven Lively Arts did win an Emmy for Best New Program of 1957, so one could say that The
Nutcracker was included in that win, although the award itself did not specifically say so.)

Years later, Alessandra Ferri danced the role of Clara in a stage revival of Baryshnikov's
production.



Tony Williams, who studied with me in The Boston Ballet School, and danced with me in The Boston
Ballet Company, has created a totally new and different version of Nutcracker at his Ballet
Company "Ballet Rox." Tony Calls it "Mixed Nuts" It got great reviews in the Boston Phoenix.
Here is the review by By Marcia B. Siegel, December 19, 2008.

"Ballet Rox's Urban Nutcracker, the ultimate multicultural Christmas celebration, has
become so inclusive, it's almost a blur. The cultural identities are mostly intact, but
there's so much going on around them that you can lose track of the reason they're all on the same
stage together. Maybe it doesn't matter. The show, at John Hancock Hall through 21 December,
is a lot of fun, and it takes its highbrow heritage with a bucket of salt."

"Artistic director Anthony Williams and scenarist David Ira Rottenberg have set the
traditional Nutcracker story in the home of a present-day extended family, and the
Tchaikovsky score is spiked with its Duke Ellington counterpart. The slim plot follows the
standard script. After the excitement of the party, Clarice dreams of a mouse invasion, toys
coming to life, snowflakes in toe shoes, and then a string of dancing confections, all
prompted by the magic of an avuncular Drosselmeyer."

Marcia Siegel continues: "Like other Nutcracker productions, this one has a street full of
civilians to set the scene. Swarms of teenagers with their ringleaders strut onto the turf: a
team of double-dutch experts, five Irish stepdancers led by Brendan O'Brien, eight
tapdancers led by Sean Fielder, and two moonwalking poppers (twins Billy and Bob McClain) who
can move each body part separately like mechanical dolls and can make their red satin shirts
ripple by â€” how else? â€” energizing their skin.

These rowdy clans interact in challenge dances and boogie along with whoever's doing a solo.
They make way for a quartet of cool seniors (Ilanga, Christian Scott, Gilbert White, and John
Wyche) who sing doo-wop oldies. Amid the throngs, Clarice (Rebecca Paul), her mom (Melodie
Jeffery Cassell), and bratty brother Omar (Nolan Jones) meet up with Drosselmeyer and his
assistant Mini-Meyer (Michael Shannon and Yo-el Cassell) and invite them home to entertain
the family's guests.

The party is hardly less chaotic, even without the rope jumpers and rhythm-dance groups.
There's lots of hugging and agitated rushing around. Grandfather (Gilbert White) stands in
for an absent dad. Mini-Meyer, a character whose hyperactive syndrome seems to have gotten
much worse since the last time I saw the show, keeps the room at a constant buzz. A tipsy aunt
(Natalie VanLandingham) pins him down on the sofa with a kiss, but that's the only time his
fidgets let up.

Finally I settled down to enjoy the inspired zaniness, like the battle between the picnicking
mice and the girl prizefighters on pointe. I appreciated the physicality of the real contact
and choreographed acrobatics when the Mouse King (Gary Vaughn) duels with the Nutcracker
(Langston Fishburne). And the snowstorm seemed almost restful, with only the dancers
whirling, leaping, and stepping smoothly in organized patterns.

In the second act, Clarice meets the Sugar Plum Fairy (Autumn Hill Friday night, with partner
Philip Ingrassia), whose classical routine incorporates Ellington-esque jazzy shrugs and
discreet bounces that she teaches to three young disciples. The "Sweets" divertissements
proceed as usual, with local flavorings. My favorite was the four fleshy Spanish ladies, who
did a terrific skirt dance to accompany a bland ballerina (Olga Marchenko) in "Ritmo Latino."
Rick Vigo led his hula-hoop virtuosos in the "Candy Cane" variation, and Erin Washington and
Sean Fielder supervised a bunch of tiny tappers in "Mother Ginger." Breakdancers sparred
with Russian folk dancers in "Caviar Caper." Branchette Janelle Gilchrist did campy ballet
to Ellington's "Waltz of the Flowers" in swingtime, and six little girls shepherded by
Marzipan Meredith Baer bounced in fine precision on blue-and-yellow polka-dot beach
balls."

The review concludes...

"I wouldn't say this Nutcracker features the sustained choreographic challenge that the
traditional work can put to its hordes of children. What it does have is energy and enterprise,
and heart. After Sugar Plum's farewell, Clarice, asleep on the sofa, is awakened from her
dream by her Father, who's home in uniform from Iraq â€” the sweetest present of all."

I enjoyed the review, and knowing Tony, his production should not be missed! Lots of people
must agree! Ballet Rox gave 21 Performances last December at the Hancock Building's Theatre
in Back Bay...



Recent Russian Versions by The Bolshoi and The Kirov



There have been notable Russian productions of the ballet in recent years, performed by the
Bolshoi Ballet and the Kirov Ballet respectively. Some of these have also been released on
DVD.

Ivan Vsevolozhksy's original costume sketch for The Nutcracker (1892)

Suites Of The Music derived from this ballet became very popular on the concert stage.

The composer also made a selection of eight of the more popular numbers from the ballet before
the ballet's December 1892 premiere, forming The Nutcracker Suite , Op. 71a, intended for
concert performance. The suite was first performed, under the composer's direction, on 19
March 1892 at an assembly of the St. Petersburg branch of the Musical Society [ 1 ] . The suite
became instantly popular; the complete ballet did not achieve its great popularity until
around the mid-1960s.



However, nearly all of the CD and LP recordings of the complete ballet present Tchaikovsky's
score exactly as he originally conceived it.

Even though the composer, Peter (Pyotor) ilyich Tchaikovsky, himself extracted a suite of
eight pieces from the ballet, that authoritative move has not prevented later hands from
arranging other selections and sequences of numbers. Eventually one of these ended up in
Disney 's Fantasia . In any case, The Nutcracker Suite should not be mistaken for the complete
ballet.

    Although the original ballet is only about 85 minutes long, and therefore much shorter
    than either Swan Lake or The Sleeping Beauty , some modern staged performances have
    omitted or re-ordered some of the music, or inserted selections from elsewhere, thus
    adding to the confusion over the suites. In fact, most of the very famous versions of the
    ballet have had the order of the dances slightly re-arranged, if they have not actually
    altered the music.

    - For example, in The Nutcracker: a Fantasy on Ice , a television adaptation for ice
    skating from 1983 starring Dorothy Hamill and Robin Cousins and telecast on HBO ,
    Tchaikovsky's score underwent not only reordering, but also insertion of music from his
    other ballets and also of music from Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov 's Caucasian Sketches .

    

    - The 1954 George Balanchine New York City Ballet version, broadcast on TV in heavily
    abridged form in 1957 by CBS, restaged by the network in more complete form in 1958, and
    filmed with Macaulay Culkin in the title role for movie theatres in 1993, adds to
    Tchaikovsky's score an entr'acte that the composer wrote for Act II of "The Sleeping
    Beauty". It is used as a transition between the departure of the guests and the battle with
    the mice. During this transition, Clara's mother appears in the living room and throws a
    blanket over the girl, who has crept downstairs and fallen asleep on the sofa; then
    Drosselmeyer appears, repairs the Nutcracker, and binds the jaw with a handkerchief. In
    addition, the "Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy" is moved from near the end of Act II to near the
    beginning of the second act, just after the Sugar Plum Fairy makes her first appearance.
    To help the musical transition, the tarantella that comes before the dance is also cut.

    

    - In 1965, on New Year's Day, ABC-TV telecast a one-hour abridgement of choreographer Lew
    Christensen 's version created for the San Francisco Ballet (the choreographer was one
    of Willam Christensen's brothers). Cynthia Gregory danced the role of the Sugar Plum
    Fairy and dancer Terry Orr was the Snow King. [ 6 ]

    

    - A filmed German-American co-production, first telecast in the United States by CBS in
    1965, hosted and narrated by Eddie Albert , and choreographed by Kurt Jacob , featured a
    largely German, but still international cast made up from several companies, including
    Edward Villella , Patricia McBride and Melissa Hayden from the New York City Ballet . It
    aired on CBS annually between 1965 and 1968, and then was withdrawn from American network
    television. Famed German dancer Harald Kreutzberg appeared (in what was probably his
    last role) in the dual roles of Drosselmeyer and the Snow King (though in one listing,
    Drosselmeyer has been re-christened Uncle Alex Hoffman â€” presumably a
    reference to E.T.A. Hoffmann, who wrote the original tale). [1] This production cut the
    ballet down to a one-act version lasting slightly less than an hour, and drastically
    re-ordered all the dances, even to the point of altering the storyline (instead of
    defeating the Mouse King, who does not even appear in this production, Clara and the
    Nutcracker must now journey to the Castle of the Sugar Plum Fairy, where the Fairy will
    wave her wand and turn the Nutcracker back into a Prince). This production inserted some
    music from Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty , as two bluebirds were brought in as
    characters to dance the Bluebird Pas de Deux from that work.

    

    - Rudolf Nureyev 's 1967 version for the Royal Ballet, in which he dances both the roles of
    Drosselmeyer and the Prince, but not the Nutcracker, changes the order of some of the
    musical numbers, repeating the music of the "mice attack" and the departure of the guests
    at the end, and omitting the Final Waltz and Apotheosis which normally conclude the
    ballet. It was videotaped in 1968.

    

    - In Baryshnikov's American Ballet Theatre version, all of the original Tchaikovsky
    score is used, but the order of the divertissement numbers in Act II (the section of the
    ballet with the least plot) is changed, and the "Arabian Dance" had to be omitted in the
    television version in order to bring the program in at 90 minutes (counting the three
    commercial breaks). Drosselmeyer makes his appearance at the Christmas party earlier,
    just before the Marche, and the music normally used for his entrance is here used as
    scoring for the puppet show. Baryshnikov also turned the Adagio from the "Pas de Deux"
    into a dance for Clara and the Nutcracker/Prince rather than one for the Sugar Plum Fairy
    and Prince Orgeat, making it the emotional climax by shifting it to immediately before
    the "Final Waltz and Apotheosis" which closes the ballet.

    

    - Pacific Northwest Ballet 's Nutcracker , staged in 1983 and filmed for movie theatres in
    1986 (as Nutcracker: The Motion Picture ) features sets and costumes by Maurice Sendak .
    It adds a duet from Tchaikovsky's opera The Queen of Spades that is heard during the
    Christmas party sequence. In addition, the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy is placed very
    early in the second act, rather than its traditional place toward the end, and is danced by
    the dream Clara. This one also omits the Sugar Plum Fairy herself. It should be noted that
    this version tries to be truer to E. T. A. Hoffmann's original story, complete with its
    darker aspects and a second act with more context and flavor, although much of that flavor
    comes from the imaginations of Sendak and choreographer Kent Stowell , rather than from
    the actual Hoffmann story.

    

    - In the Royal Ballet, London 's 1985 version, telecast on A&E , Tchaikovsky's score is
    used and the original order of the dances is not changed at all, but the Mother Ginger dance
    is omitted. This version was re-staged with some of the same dancers taking different
    roles, as well as with new dancers, in 2001. In the 2001 version, Alina Cojocaru danced the
    role of Clara, a role danced in 1985 by Julie Rose. Anthony Dowell , who had danced the Sugar
    Plum Fairy's Cavalier in 1985, danced the role of Drosselmeyer in the 2001 version,
    telecast by PBS .

    

    - Another ice skating version, 1994's Nutcracker on Ice , starring Oksana Baiul as Clara
    and Victor Petrenko as Drosselmeyer, was originally telecast on NBC , and is now shown on
    several cable stations. It was also condensed to slightly less than an hour, radically
    altering and compressing both the music and the storyline.

    

    - Still another one-hour ice skating version, also called Nutcracker on Ice , was staged
    on television in 1995, starring Peggy Fleming as the Sugar Plum Fairy, Nicole Bobek as
    Clara, and Todd Eldredge as the Nutcracker.

    

    - And yet another version of Nutcracker on Ice , this one starring Tai Babilonia as Clara
    and Randy Gardner as the Nutcracker/ Prince, was released straight-to-video in 1998,
    appearing on DVD in 2007.

    





Animated versions



    There have been several animated versions of the original story, but none can really be
    actually considered an animated version of the ballet itself. All of these invent
    characters that appear neither in the original E.T.A. Hoffmann story nor in the ballet.

    - Selections from the Nutcracker Suite were heard in the 1940 Disney animation film
    Fantasia . In this film, the music from The Nutcracker is accompanied by dancing fairies ,
    mushrooms and fish , among others and, as Deems Taylor mentions, the Nutcracker itself is
    nowhere in sight. As mentioned before, this suite should not be mistaken for the entire
    Nutcracker . The suite used is a slightly altered version of the Nutcracker Suite
    selected by the composer [see The Suite in this article]. This version omits the Overture
    and the Marche, and the remaining dances are reordered (Note: The accompanying
    animation is provided in parentheses):

                        c. Reed-Flutes (Blossoms)

                    

                        d. Arabian Dance (Goldfish)

                    

                        e. Russian Dance (Thistles and Orchids)

                    

                

            

                2. Waltz of the Flowers (Frost Fairies & Snow Fairies)

            

        

    

    

    - In 1979, a stop-motion puppet version, entitled Nutcracker Fantasy , was released,
    using some of the Tchaikovsky music. This version featured the voices of Christopher Lee
    as Drosselmeyer, and Melissa Gilbert as Clara.

    

    

    - Care Bears: The Nutcracker was an 1988 animated television special based extremely
    loosely on the original ballet. It was made for video, and was first shown on TV on the
    Disney Channel .

    

    

    - In 1990, another animated version, The Nutcracker Prince , starring the voices of
    Kiefer Sutherland and Megan Follows , was released. This one also used Tchaikovsky's
    music, but was actually a straightforward full-length animated cartoon, not a ballet
    film.

    

    

    - The Jetlag Productions animation studio produced its own version of the story in 1994
    entitled, simply " The Nutcracker " . The animated adaptation used some of Tchaikovsky's
    compositions as well as some original melodies and songs.

    

    

    - In 1999, a comedy version entitled The Nuttiest Nutcracker became the first
    computer-animated film released straight to video. An example of the skewed tone that
    this version took may be inferred from the fact that Phyllis Diller provided the voice of
    an obese Sugar Plum Fairy. Some of Tchaikovsky's music was used.

    

    

    - Barbie in the Nutcracker is a direct-to-video version of the story starring, of course,
    Barbie the doll, released in 2001. It significantly alters the storyline.

    

    

    - Princess Tutu , an anime that uses elements from many ballets as both music and as part of
    the storyline, uses the music from The Nutcracker in many places throughout its run,
    including using an arranged version of the overture as the theme for the main character.
    Both the first and last episodes feature The Nutcracker as their 'theme', and one of the
    main characters is named Drosselmeyer.

    

    

    - A House of Mouse special Snowed in at the House of Mouse included an animated short,
    starring Mickey Mouse as the Nutcracker, Minnie Mouse as Clara, Ludwig von Drake as a
    character based on Herr Drosselmeyer, Goofy as the Sugar Plum Fairy and Donald Duck as the
    "Duck-stroke-Mouse-stroke-King-type-person" (or the Mouse King), and portrayed a
    brief overview of the story, narrated by John Cleese . The story ran with modern
    rock-style musical accompaniment.

    

    

    - In 2004, Argus International in Moscow produced an animated version of "The Nutcracker
    and the Mouse King", though it has a different tale to tell. The US version was released in
    2005 and it features the voices of Leslie Nielsen as the Mouse King, Robert Hays as the
    mouse Squeak, Fred Willard as the mouse Bubble, and Eric Idle (of Monty Python fame) as the
    voice of Herr Drosselmeyer.

    

    

    - A 2007 straight-to-video animated film, Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale , features, of
    course, the cartoon characters Tom and Jerry , and incorporates elements of the ballet,
    including some of Tchaikovsky's music, into the film. However, it uses a very different
    storyline. As in Fantasia , none of the actual characters in the ballet appear, including
    the Nutcracker himself.

    

    

    - The Wonder Pets on Nick Jr. have a Christmas themed episode called "Save the
    Nutcracker", featuring the Nutcracker and Mouse King from the original ballet, as well
    as much of the music.

    





Jazz Versions



In 1960, Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn arranged their own adaptation of the Nutcracker
Suite for the Duke Ellington Orchestra featuring the Overture , Toot Toot Tootsie Toot (Dance
of the Reed-Flutes), Peanut Brittle Brigade (March), Sugar Rum Cherry (Dance of the Sugar
Plum Fairy), the Entr'acte, The Volga Vouty (Russian Trepak), Chinoiserie (Chinese Tea),
Dance of the Floreadores (Waltz of the Flowers), and Arabesque Cookie (Arabian Coffee). The
suite is arranged for the traditional five saxophones (two alto, two tenor, one baritone),
four trumpets, a small three trombone section, drums, piano and bass, with second alto
doubling on clarinet, bamboo flute, both tenors doubling on clarinet, baritone doubling on
bass clarinet, and first trumpet doubling on tambourine. The arrangement has been played by
Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra side-by-side with the New York
Philharmonic performing the respective original movements. In 1999, the arrangement was
expanded to fit Donald Byrd's adaptation of The Nutcracker with modern choreography and
themes revolving around an African-American family in Harlem, and an aged Clara's
experience through the Civil Rights movement. David Berger composed, arranged, performed,
and recorded expansions from Ellington and Strayhorn's suite to mesh with the modern ballet.

In 2001, another jazz version appeared on television, this one entitled The Swinging
Nutcracker .

Another one, using the Ellington-Strayhorn jazz arrangement of the score, and entitled
Nutcracker Sweeties , appeared on cable television in 2006, and is available on DVD. It sets
the ballet in the United States during the 1940s, and all of the dances, except for the last two,
which he actually sees, are visualized by a World War II soldier on leave roaming the streets of
New York in a rented car and listening to the jazz arrangement, which is being broadcast over
the radio. The choreography is by David Bintley , and the work is performed by the Birmingham
Royal Ballet .

A variation of The Nutcracker is performed in the Broadway musical Thoroughly Modern Millie .
During a scene in a speakeasy , "The Nuttycracker Suite" is played. It features jazz versions
of the famous dances within The Nutcracker , especially the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.





Discography



Many recordings have been made since 1909 of the Nutcracker Suite , which made its appearance
on disc in what is now historically considered the first record album . [ 12 ] But it was not until
the LP album was developed that recordings of the complete ballet began to be made. Because the
ballet's approximate hour and a half length, it fit very comfortably onto two LPs. Most CD
recordings take up two discs, often with fillers due to the under ninety-minute length of the
ballet. An unusual exception is the Valery Gergiev recording, which runs for 81 minutes, and
thus fit onto one CD.

1954, the year in which the Balanchine version of the ballet was first staged, was also the year
that the first complete recording - in mono sound - appeared on Mercury Records . It was
performed by the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Antal DorÃ¡ti , who years
later went on to record it complete twice more with other orchestras, on Mercury Records in
1962 and on Philips Records in 1975 respectively. These later recordings were both made in
stereo. Some have hailed the 1975 recording, featuring the Amsterdam Concertgebouw
Orchestra , as the finest ever made of the complete ballet. [ 13 ] It also is faithful to the score
in employing a boys choir in the Waltz of the Snowflakes. Many other recordings use an adult or
mixed choir.

In 1956, the conductor Artur RodziÅ„ski made a complete recording of the ballet on stereo
master tapes for Westminster Records , but because stereo was not possible on the LP format in
1956, the ballet was issued in stereo on magnetic tape , and only a mono LP set was issued.
(Recently, the Rodzinski performance was issued in stereo on CD .)

In 1958, the first stereo LP of the complete ballet, with Ernest Ansermet conducting the
Orchestre de la Suisse Romande , appeared on Decca Records in the UK and London Records in the
U.S.. And with the advent of the stereo era coinciding with the growing popularity of the
complete ballet, many other complete recordings of it have been made over the last 30 years.
Notable conductors who have done so include Maurice Abravanel , AndrÃ© Previn , Valery
Gergiev, Mariss Jansons , Seiji Ozawa , Richard Bonynge , Semyon Bychkov and Gennadi
Rozhdestvensky .

The soundtrack of the 1977 Baryshnikov television production, conducted by Kenneth
Schermerhorn , was issued in stereo on a CBS Masterworks 2 LP-set, but it has not appeared on CD.
(The 78-minute soundtrack would today fit quite easily onto one CD.) The LP soundtrack
recording was, for a time, the only stereo album of the Baryshnikov Nutcracker available,
since the show was originally telecast only in mono, and it was not until recently that it began
to be telecast with stereo sound.

The first complete recording of the ballet in digital stereo was issued in 1985, on a 2-CD RCA
set featuring Leonard Slatkin conducting the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra . This album
originally had no "filler", but it has recently been re-issued on a multi-CD set containing
complete recordings of Tchaikovsky's two other ballets, Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty .

The two major theatrical film versions of the ballet, Nutcracker: The Motion Picture ,
conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras , and George Balanchine's The Nutcracker , conducted by
David Zinman , have each had soundtrack recordings as well.

Notable albums of excerpts from the ballet, rather than just the usual Nutcracker Suite , were
recorded by Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra for Columbia Masterworks
, and Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for RCA Victor. Arthur Fiedler and the
Boston Pops Orchestra , as well as Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra have also
recorded albums of extended excerpts. Neither Ormandy, Reiner, nor Fiedler ever recorded a
complete version of the ballet; however, Kunzel's album of excerpts runs 73 minutes,
containing more than two-thirds of the music.

Conductors who have recorded only the Nutcracker Suite include such luminaries as Claudio
Abbado , Leonard Bernstein , Leopold Stokowski , Mstislav Rostropovich , Herbert von Karajan
, Sir Georg Solti , Sir Neville Marriner and James Levine , among many others.
