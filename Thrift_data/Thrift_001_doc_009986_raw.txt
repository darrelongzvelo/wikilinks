Artist Info:



Westlife are an Irish pop group formed on 3 July 1998 . The group's original lineup comprised
Nicky Byrne , Kian Egan , Mark Feehily , Shane Filan and Brian McFadden (departed from the band
in 2004). The group is the only act in British or Irish history to have their first seven singles
go straight to Number 1, and they have gone on to sell over 44 million records worldwide [ 1 ]
which includes their studio, single, video, and compilation albums. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Despite the
group's worldwide success, they've only had one U.S. hit on the Billboard Hot 100 charts:
"Swear It Again", which made it to #20 in 2000.

Westlife were originally signed by Simon Cowell and are currently managed by Louis Walsh .
They garnered 14 number one singles in the United Kingdom, the third-highest in UK history,
tying with Cliff Richard and trailing behind only Elvis Presley and The Beatles . The group has
also broken a few top records, including "Music artist with most consecutive number 1's in the
UK". It was officially announced by the Official Charts Company that they are the "2nd biggest
selling artist" (trailing behind Robbie Williams ) and "Biggest selling band of the decade"
(beating Coldplay ) in UK with 11 million album sales. [ 4 ]

On 1 June 2008, Westlife marked their 10th anniversary with a concert in Croke Park, Dublin
which saw more than 83,000 fans attending the special occasion. Music Week revealed on their
website that Westlife is the official third top touring act within the years 2005–2008,
while they were 7th top touring act of 2008. [ 5 ] Also in 2008, they were declared as Ireland's
ninth-richest celebrities under 30 years old and 13th in general with 36 million euros as a
group. [ 6 ] In 2009, they dropped as 16th richest Irish with estimated 8 million euros each. [ 7 ]

Kentwood,Michigan. [ 10 ]



The video starts off with Enrique seen shirtless against a dark black background. As the music
starts, Enrique is seen singing while digitally added red and orange "heartbeats" are added
in simulation with his heartbeat. Nicole breaks into the song where she is seen sitting nude
waist up against a solid black background. Similar to Enrique, digitally added blue and
purple "heartbeats" are added in simulation with her heartbeat. In the following scene,
Nicole and Enrique are seen together in a white, mirrored room. Enrique is wearing a red
t-shirt and jeans while Nicole is wearing a red bra and underwear with a black lace dress
over-top. The video cuts to a scene where the hook of the song kicks in; they're seen face to face
looking like they're about to kiss while singing their parts. During the scene they're seen
with a black spotlight on them while alternating blue and green background lighting is added.
The video ends with Enrique's "heartbeat" darkening with each beat until it eventually fades
out into a solid black screen.

Song Info:



"Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)" is a song by My Chemical Romance . It was released as the first
single from their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys .



Music Video Info:



The music video premiered on MTV on October 14, 2010. The video was co-directed by Roboshobo
and Gerard Way and features comic book author Grant Morrison . [ 8 ] The music video was first
previewed in the short trailer titled " Art is the Weapon " which was released on September 17,
2010. [ 9 ] Album opener "Look Alive, Sunshine" was included in the music video. [ 10 ] MTV posted
photo previews on October 8, and a 30 second preview video on October 11. [ 11 ]

The video features a strangely garbed outlaw gang called the Killjoys ( Gerard Way as Party
Poison, Mikey Way as Kobra Kid, Ray Toro as Jet Star and Frank Iero as Fun Ghoul), who are being
pursued in the badlands around Battery City by the sinister executive Korse (Morrison) of
Better Living Industries (BL/ind) and his vampire-masked henchmen (the Draculoids); in
between battles with Better Living, the gang are indulging in pornographic magazines, fast
driving, and hacking vending machines. The Killjoys have a young girl as one of their members
(portrayed by Grace Jeanette ), who BL/ind is out to capture. At the end of the video, after a
Mexican standoff , the Killjoys lie defeated on the ground, and the girl has been captured by
Korse and the Draculoids. Korse tells the Killjoys to "keep running." The music video for
later single " SING " is a companion piece and continues the story of the Killjoys and BL/ind.

In an interview with the band for KROQ , Gerard Way revealed that members of the band Mindless
Self Indulgence appear in the video, with guitarist Steve, Righ? as the DJ, "Dr. Death
Defying", and vocalist Jimmy Urine as the "main, tall Draculoid (a masked character in a white
suit)". [ 12 ] Urine was originally intended to play the roller skater "Show Pony", but was
changed to a Draculoid as he cannot skate. [ 2 ] After the video's premiere, MTV released a
"Pop-Culture Cheat Sheet" listing many of the movie and TV references in the video, including
films such as Blade Runner , Easy Rider and Terminator 2: Judgement Day . [ 13 ] There is also a
reference to their previous album ' The Black Parade ' at the 1:28 marker in the video where a
half buried skeleton wearing a black marching jacket at the bottom of the screen can be seen.
Similarly, in one of the "Transmissions" by Dr. Death on the band's website features a Killjoy
(presumably Party Poison) searching through an abandoned room, passing by Mikey Way's Black
Parade uniform and picking up one of the skull-designed masks featured in Black Parade
merchandise, before finding the Mouskat mask seen in the video for Na Na Na . Media Info:

Ke$ha - Your Love Is My Drug

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SznndU_spVU/TRBFoRFJNiI/AAAAAAAAAw4/yyPeOSM8Scw/s320/Ke%2524ha%2B-%2BYour%2BLove%2BIs%2BMy%2BDrug.jpg
Song Info:



"Your Love Is My Drug" is a song by American recording artist and songwriter Kesha , from her
debut album, Animal . It was released as the album's third single on May 21, 2010. The song was
written by Kesha, Pebe Sebert, with Ammo , who co-produced the song with Dr. Luke and Benny
Blanco . "Your Love Is My Drug"'s initial writing took place during a plane ride. Kesha stated
the song had a carefree message and wasn't meant to be taken too seriously.

Critical reception of the song has been mixed to positive. Critics complimented the hook but
had mixed reactions with the chorus. Some praised Kesha for knowing her way around a strong pop
chorus, while others called it predictable and dull. Prior to the release of Animal , the song
charted in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Since being released as a single
it has gone on to reach the top five in Australia and the United States, as well as reaching the
top ten in Canada. It has gone on to sell over two million copies in the US alone. Kesha performed
the song alongside " Tik Tok " on the thirty-fifth season of Saturday Night Live The Beatles '
Yellow where she was covered in glow in the dark tribal-like make-up. In the music video, Kesha
is portrayed in the desert while being chased around by her love interest. The main idea behind
the video is being so in love with someone that you lose your head, comparable to love being a
drug. The video features a digital animation aspect which was inspired by



Music Video Info:



The music video for the song, directed by Honey, [ 20 ] was shot on April 6 and April 7, 2010 in the
Lancaster, California desert. [ 21 ] It premiered on Vevo at 12:01 a.m. on May 13, 2010. [ 22 ]
Kesha described the concept behind the video in an interview, "I wanted it to be like a
psychedelic trip of the mind, comparable with being so disgustingly in love with someone that
you lose your head." [ 1 ] She chose to also incorporate an animal aspect to the video explaining
that she was "a huge animal lover". [ 23 ] Kesha elaborated on the experience, "I also ride an
elephant — no big deal! — and, um, I dance around a cave with black-light body paint and a
python. I was in a cave, in the desert, and it was really fun." [ 1 ] When asked about the
inspiration for the video, she said "This video was inspired by the Beatles' Yellow Submarine
movie, the animation aspect. There's a little bit of [that] in there too". [ 1 ]

The video begins with Kesha waking up next to her love interest; she then proceeds to run away
while being chased by the man. Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are
shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the
sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated
water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid.
The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with
Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to
another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a
cave with a python around her neck. [ 24 ] The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a
campfire while still in the desert. [ 25 ]

James Montgomery from MTV said that "Your Love Is My Drug" was a "supremely catchy pop tune" and
that the video was "the perfectly blissed-out accompaniment." Montgomery chided the video
for "not making much sense" but noted "that hardly matters" as "Kesha has stumbled on a perfect
formula for pop success: Don't think too big, or too much. Sometimes an elephant ride is just an
elephant ride". His conclusion of the video and of Kesha herself was, "It's a lot harder than
you'd think to make something seem this effortless. Like I said, you can accuse Kesha of many
things — but don't ever say she's not smart. " [ 24 ] Media Info:

Kim Leoni - Medicine

Artist Info:



Kim Leoni is a charismatic, half Indonesian half Dutch performer living in Amsterdam, The
Netherlands. Thanks to her parents, Kim spent her childhood living on three continents –
Asia, Europe and the USA. While living in Miami, Kim joined a dance troupe and spent her teenage
years dancing and performing in clubs throught the state of Florida and beyond. Kim
attributes her love for music to the percussive sounds of Indonesia , and her love of dancing
and performing to the first dance steps she learned on the streets of Miami. At the age of 17 Kim
returned to the Netherlands and found herself a target of interest of several modelling
agencies, which led her to a short-lived career as a model. However, finding her initial
modelling career unappealing and dull, she returned to her first love - music, performing
with a local pop band and gathering her first studio experiences. In August 2006, a chance
meeting with producers Michel Pollen and Brane Kovak (at a birthday party of a mututal friend,
where Kim gave an impromptu singing performance!) led to the first collaboration – the song
called “Again”, an impassionate tale of a stormy relationship “based on a true
story”. “At first, we were drawn to Kim by her charisma and beauty, but when we heard the
voice we knew we had to start making music together.”– say the producers, who are already
working with Kim on the first Kim Leoni album.

Kylie Minogue - All The Lovers (DMCA by blogger.com no to be published again)



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SznndU_spVU/TRA8MA4FMxI/AAAAAAAAAwI/vvOpjKgM5g8/s320/Kylie%2BMinogue%2B-%2BAll%2BThe%2BLovers.jpg
Song Info:



"All the Lovers" is a song by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue . It is the first single
from her eleventh studio album, Aphrodite . "All the Lovers" was written by English
electropop duo Kish Mauve and was one of the last songs to be recorded for the album. Minogue
chose the song as the first single since she felt it was reflective of the euphoric mood of
Aphrodite . "All the Lovers" is a midtempo electropop song with prominent synthesizers, that
has been compared to Minogue's 2004 single " I Believe in You ". Its lyrics are an invitation to
the dancefloor, while comparing previous relationships to one's current lover. "All the
Lovers" was positively received by contemporary critics, who praised its dance anthem
nature and deemed it as a classic Minogue single.

The song became a commercial success particularly in Europe, reaching the top ten in
countries such as Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Italy, and peaking inside the top five in
France, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video was inspired by the
installations of Spencer Tunick , and portrays Minogue on top of a flash mob of people wearing
white underwear, surrounded by different white floating objects. Minogue explained that
the video was an expression of her view on sexuality and sensuality. It received positive
reviews, with critics complimenting its aesthetic and imagery. "All the Lovers" has been
performed by Minogue in a number of live appearances, including the fifth's season finale of
Germany's Next Topmodel . Music Video Info:



The music video for "All the Lovers" was filmed on May 8 and May 9, 2010 in downtown Los Angeles,
California . It was directed by Joseph Kahn , who was reportedly chosen by Minogue since he
could give the video a fresh, new feel. [ 26 ] The concept is a re-imagination of works by
American artist Spencer Tunick , known for his installations that feature large numbers of
nude people. Kahn and Minogue created two treatments for the video, but chose the edgier
option. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Minogue wears jewelry from designer Shaun Leane. [ 29 ] The video begins with
a flash mob of people dropping items with QR Code on them. Although the code isn't directly
scannable from the video, a blogger has reconstructed the code to reveal that it says "LOVE." [
citation needed ] They then start kissing while taking their clothes off in an empty street.
They gather on the middle in their white underwear, where Minogue appears surrounded by
doves, wearing a white cobweb-style t-shirt over a black bra and knickers, with matching
white thigh high boots. [ 26 ] [ 30 ] The flash mob becomes bigger as the video continues. During
the song's bridge, a white horse gallops between couples kissing. The buildings are
surrounded by floating marshmallows as well as a giant inflatable elephant. [ 31 ] The video
was noted by some critics for featuring a number of same-sex couples , which Minogue explained
paid homage to her gay audience who helped propel her initial success. [ 32 ] Minogue said of the
music video after its release, She originally wanted to wear sombre clothes for the shoots,
but Kahn insisted on a smaller white outfit.

"People go nuts over it, so that’s amazing. [Kahn] came up with a brilliant, simple idea and
executed it so sensitively, I thought. It’s still cutting edge, it still gets you a little
hot under the collar, but I think there’s a real sensitivity. It’s what I’m about and
what I love. [...] What I'm so thrilled about is the energy that comes through and that oneness.
[...] It is a perfect and genuine expression of how I feel about sexuality and sensuality. I
totally believe love should be for love's sake." [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Media Info:
