Alfred Lee Loomis

(November 4, 1887 â€“ August 11, 1975)

and private science

Alfred Lee Loomis (November 4, 1887 â€“ August 11, 1975) was an American attorney ,
investment banker , physicist , philanthropist , and patron of scientific research. He
established the Loomis Laboratory in Tuxedo Park, New York , and his role in the development of
radar is considered instrumental in the Allied victory in World War II . He invented the
Aberdeen Chronograph for measuring muzzle velocities, proposed the LORAN navigational
system, contributed significantly (perhaps critically, according to Luis Alvarez [1] ) to
the development of a ground-controlled approach technology for aircraft, and participated
in preliminary meetings of the Manhattan Project . Loomis also made contributions to
biological instrumentationâ€”working with Edmund Newton Harvey , he co-invented the
microscope centrifuge, [2] and pioneered techniques for electroencephalography . [3] In
1937 he discovered the sleep K-complex brainwave. [4] [5]

Early years

Born in Manhattan , Loomis was the son of Julia Stimson and Henry Patterson Loomis. There were
prominent members of society on both sides of his family; primarily these were physicians.
Alfred’s parents separated when he was very young, and his father died when Alfred was in
college. His first cousin was Henry Stimson , who held cabinet-level positions in the
administrations of William Howard Taft , Herbert Hoover , Franklin Roosevelt , and Harry S.
Truman . From the boy’s early years, Stimson exerted considerable influence on Loomis.

Loomis completed undergraduate studies in mathematics and science at Yale University and
was graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1912. Immediately following his
graduation, Loomis married and began practicing corporate law in the firm of Winthrop and
Stimson, where he was very successful.

His wife was Elizabeth Ellen Farnsworth of Dedham, Massachusetts , from a prominent Boston
society family, whom he wed on June 22, 1912. They had three sons, Alfred Lee Jr., William
Farnsworth, and Henry .

In 1917 Alfred Loomis and Landon K. Thorne , the wealthy husband of Loomis’s sister Julia,
purchased 17,000Â acres (69Â km 2 ) of Hilton Head Island , which they established as a
private preserve for riding, boating, fishing, and hunting. The centerpiece of the property
was the old Honey Horn Plantation . Loomis’s hobbies included automobiles and yachting,
including the racing of America’s Cup yachts against the Vanderbilts and Astors .

Military service and a new career in finance

After the United States entered World War I , in 1917 Loomis volunteered for military service.
He was commissioned as a captain, and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He worked in
ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, where he invented the Aberdeen
Chronograph , the first portable instrument capable of measuring muzzle velocity and the
striking force of bullets. At Aberdeen he met and worked with a Johns Hopkins physicist,
Robert W. Wood , under whose influence Loomis’s long-standing interest in inventing and
gadgetry evolved into the serious pursuit of experimental and practical physics.

In the 1920s, Loomis collaborated with his brother-in-law, Landon K. Thorne, rather than
returning to the practice of law. They acquired Bonbright and Company and brought it from the
verge of bankruptcy to becoming a preeminent U. S. investment banking-house specializing in
public utilities. They became very wealthy by financing electric companies as these began to
establish the electrical infrastructure of rural America, and Loomis sat on the boards of
several banks and electric utilities. Loomis and Thorne pioneered the concept of the holding
company , consolidating many of the electric companies that operated on the East Coast of the
United States . Loomis further increased his fortune via insider trading practices that now
are illegal.

In anticipation of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , he had converted most of his investments into
cash after the market had risen so dramatically that he and his partner decided it was
unsustainable. Once the stock market crash had bankrupted the majority of speculators,
while Wall Street floundered, he became even wealthier as a result of purchasing stocks
cheaply after they had plummeted in value and few people had the cash to reinvest.

Loomis Laboratory at Tuxedo Park

Taking advantage of his considerable wealth, Loomis increasingly indulged his interest in
science. He established a personal laboratory near his mansion within the exclusive enclave
of Tuxedo Park, New York . He and his small staff conducted pioneering studies in spectrometry
, high-intensity sound waves, electro-encephalography , and the precise measurement of
time, chronometry .

Eventually Loomis was elected to the National Academy of Sciences for his work in physics.

His laboratory was the best of its kind, containing equipment that few universities could
afford. His reputation spread quickly, particularly in Europe, where money for science was
scarce. Loomis often sent first-class tickets to famous European scientists so that they
could travel to the United States to meet with their peers and collaborate on projects. They
would be picked up at the airport or train station and brought to Tuxedo Park in his limousine.
At first, some in the scientific community called him an “eccentric dabbler,” but soon
his laboratory became the meeting place for some of the most accomplished scientists of the
time, such as Albert Einstein , Werner Heisenberg , Niels Bohr , James Franck , and Enrico Fermi
. Scientists who worked personally with him were convinced of his capability and industry.
His wealth, connections, and charm all made him highly persuasive.

He was awarded the Franklin Institute ‘s John Price Wetherill Medal in 1934 along with E.
Newton Harvey .

In 1939, Loomis began a collaboration with Ernest Lawrence , and was instrumental in
financing Lawrence’s project to construct a 184-inch (4.7Â m) cyclotron . By this time
Loomis had become a prominent figure in experimental physics and had moved his Tuxedo Park
operations to Cambridge, Massachusetts , where he established a joint operation with the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Additionally, Loomis’ 1937 house in Tuxedo Park by architect William Lescaze is regarded
as an early experiment in double-skin facade construction. This house included “an
elaborate double envelope” with a 2-foot-deep air space conditioned by a separate system
from the house itself. The object was to maintain high humidity levels inside. [6]

Loomis in World War Two

A March 1940 meeting at the University of California at Berkeley concerned the planned
184-inch cyclotron : This involved Ernest O. Lawrence , Arthur H. Compton , Vannevar Bush ,
James B. Conant , Karl T. Compton and Loomis.

In the late 1930s Loomis’s scientific team turned their attention to radio detection
studies, building a crude microwave radar which they deployed in the back of a van. They drove
it to a golf course and aimed it at the neighboring highway in order to track automobiles, then
took it to the local airport, where they tracked small aircraft.

Loomis had visited the United Kingdom and knew many of the British scientists who were working
on radar. Britain, at war with Germany, was being bombed nightly by the German Luftwaffe ,
while America was trying to stay out of the war. In 1940 the British Tizard Mission visited the
United States , desperately seeking help to develop their concepts further and construct the
technology they had invented. British scientists had developed the cavity magnetron , which
allowed their radar to be made small enough for installation in aircraft.

On hearing that the British magnetron had a thousand times the output of the best American
transmitter, Loomis invited its developers to Tuxedo Park. Because he had performed more
work in this area than anyone else in the country, Loomis was appointed by Vannevar Bush to the
National Defense Research Committee as chairman of the Microwave Committee and
vice-chairman of Division D (Detection, Controls, Instruments). Within a month he had
selected a building on the MIT campus in which to equip a laboratory, dubbing it the MIT
Radiation Laboratory, usually referred to as the Radiation Laboratory and later known
simply as the Rad Lab . He pressed for the development of radar in spite of the Army’s initial
skepticism, and arranged funding for the Rad Lab until federal money was allocated.

The MIT Rad Lab was managed by its director, Lee DuBridge . Meanwhile, Loomis assumed his
customary function of eliminating the obstacles to research and providing the
encouragement that was needed at a time when success still remained elusive. The resulting
10Â cm radar was a key technology that enabled the sinking of U-boats , spotted incoming
German bombers for the British, and provided cover for the D-Day landing. Loomis took
advantage of all his business acumen and industry contacts to ensure that no time was wasted in
its development. DuBridge later commented, “Radar won the war; the atom bomb ended it.”

Originally known as “LRN” for Loomis Radio Navigation, LORAN was invented by Loomis. It
was the most widely used long-range navigation system until the advent of GPS (which was
developed from it and only became available to the public in 2000) and LORAN is being enhanced
and retained as a land-based alternative to the satellite-based system. The system was
developed at the laboratory and is based on a pulsed hyperbolic system using a master and two
slave stations. A world network of stations exists.

Loomis also made a significant contribution to the development of ground-controlled
approach technology, a precursor of today’s instrument-landing systems that used radar
to enable ground controllers to “talk down” aircraft pilots and help them to land safely
when poor visibility made visual landings difficult or impossible. Even untrained persons
forced into the unexpected position of having to pilot an aircraft in an emergency, have been
guided to land safely using this technology.

Legacy and later years

President Roosevelt lauded the value of Loomis’s work, describing him as being the
civilian who was second perhaps only to Churchill, in facilitating the Allied victory in
World War II.

Loomis was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1940, and received several honorary
degrees: from Wesleyan University he received a D.Sc. in 1932, from Yale University an M.Sc.
in 1933, and from the University of California an LL.D. in 1941.

Loomis was married to Ellen Farnsworth for over thirty years; she was beautiful, delicate,
and often suffered from debilitating depression, eventually developing dementia. They had
three children, Alfred, Jr., a pioneering investor, two-time winner of the Bermuda Race and
head of the winning America’s Cup syndicate in 1977; Henry, head of the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting and Farnsworth, a physician and professor at Brandeis. He had an affair
with a colleague’s wife, Manette Hobart, and in 1945 he divorced Ellen and immediately
married Manette, scandalizing New York society. At this point he completely changed his
lifestyle, eschewing his multiple residences and numerous servants, and settling into a
single household in which he and his wife shared a relationship that was characterized by its
domesticity. They remained married until Alfred Loomis died more than thirty years later.

Loomis, always a very private person who avoided publicity, retreated from public life
entirely after closing the Rad Lab and finishing his related obligations in 1947. He retired
to East Hampton with Manette, and never granted another interview.

Synopsis

The Untold Story of the American Entrepreneur Who Helped Build the Atomic Bomb and Defeat the
Nazis.

Legendary financier, philanthropist, and society figure Alfred Lee Loomis gathered the
most visionary scientific minds of the twentieth century â€” Albert Einstein, Werner
Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi, and others â€” at his state-of-the-art
laboratory in Tuxedo Park, New York, in the late 1930s. He established a top-secret defense
laboratory at MIT and personally bankrolled pioneering research into new, high-powered
radar detection systems that helped defeat the German Air Force and U-boats. With Ernest
Lawrence, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, he pushed Franklin Delano Roosevelt to fund
research in nuclear fission, which led to the development of the atomic bomb.

Jennet Conant, the granddaughter of James Bryant Conant , one of the leading scientific
advisers of World War II, enjoyed unprecedented access to Loomis’ papers, as well as to
people intimately involved in his life and work. She pierces through Loomis’ obsessive
secrecy and illuminates his role in assuring the Allied victory.

New Yorker

In the prewar years, Alfred Lee Loomis was one of the most powerful men on Wall Street.

But he was also a crucial, if heretofore unsung, figure in the evolution of experimental
physics in America. In this brisk, entertaining biography, Loomis emerges as “the last of
the great amateurs,” a gentleman scientist in the mold of Benjamin Franklin, with a
quintessentially American interest in practical, rather than merely theoretical, work.
Both patron and player, he turned his massive Tuxedo Park home into a kind of Yaddo for
scientists, while also helping to develop a host of inventions, including the atom-smashing
cyclotron. Once the Second World War began, he became a central figure, along with his friends
Vannevar Bush and Ernest Lawrence, in the orchestration of American science’s
contribution to the war effort. Conant shows how Loomis, as the head of the M.I.T. Radiation
Laboratory, dexterously governed “a scientific republic” of physicists who ended up
making major contributions to anti-submarine warfare, radar, and the accuracy of night
bombing. Her group portrait offers a healthy reminder of how much good science depends on
community and collaboration, not solitary genius.

Jennet Conant is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The Irregulars: Roald Dahl and

The Man Who Knew Too Much Film from 1934:

Churchill, Hitchcock and the 1911 Sidney Street Disturbance s

The Man Who Knew Too Much is a 1934 suspense film directed by Alfred Hitchcock , featuring Peter
Lorre , and released by Gaumont British . It was one of the most successful and critically
acclaimed films of Hitchcock’s British period.

Hitchcock remade the film with James Stewart and Doris Day in 1956 for Paramount Pictures ;
it’s the only film he ever remade. The two films are, however, very different in tone, in
setting, and in many plot details

Synopsis

Bob and Jill Lawrence ( Leslie Banks and Edna Best ), are a British couple on vacation in St.
Moritz , Switzerland , with their daughter Betty ( Nova Pilbeam ). Jill is participating in a
clay pigeon shooting contest. They befriend a foreigner, Louis Bernard ( Pierre Fresnay ),
who is staying in their hotel. One evening, as Jill dances with Louis, she witnesses his
assassination as a French spy. Before dying, the spy passes on to them some vital information
to be delivered to the British consul .

In order to ensure their silence, the assassins, led by a charming and nefarious Abbott ( Peter
Lorre ), kidnap their daughter. Unable therefore to seek help from the police, the couple
return to England and, after following a series of leads, discover that the group intends to
assassinate a the Ambassador of an unidentified European country, during a concert at the
Royal Albert Hall . Jill attends the concert and distracts the gunman with a scream.

The assassins are tracked to their hide-out in a suburban church. Bob enters and is held
prisoner, but manages to escape. The police surround the building and a gunfight ensues, the
assassins holding out until their ammunition runs low and most of them have been killed.
Betty, who has been held there, and one of the criminals, are seen on the roof, and it is Jill’s
sharpshooting skills that dispatch the man, who, it emerges, was the man who beat Jill in a
shooting contest in Switzerland.

One of the assassins commits suicide rather than be captured, and Betty is returned to her
parents.

Production

Peter Lorre was unable to speak English at the time of filming (a Jew , he had only recently fled
from Nazi Germany ) and learned his lines phonetically . [1]

The shoot-out at the end of the film was based on the Sidney Street Siege , a real-life incident
which took place in London’s East End (where Hitchcock grew up) on 3 January 1911. [2] [3] [4]
The shoot-out was not included in Hitchcock’s 1956 remake . [5]

Hitchcock hired Australian composer Arthur Benjamin to write a piece of music especially for
the climactic scene at Royal Albert Hall . The music, known as the Storm Clouds cantata, is used
in both the 1934 version and the 1956 remake.

Alfred Hitchcock’s cameo appears 33 minutes into the film. He can be seen crossing the
street from right to left in a black trench coat before they enter the Chapel.

The siege was the inspiration for the final shootout in Alfred Hitchcock ‘s original 1934
version of The Man Who Knew Too Much , although not his own 1956 remake .

The Siege of Sidney Street, popularly known as the “Battle of Stepney”, was a notorious
gunfight in London’s East End on the 2nd of January 1911. Preceded by the Houndsditch
Murders, it ended with the deaths of two members of a supposedly politically-motivated gang
of burglars supposedly led by Peter Piatkow , a.k.a. “ Peter the Painter “, and sparked a
major political row over the involvement of the then Home Secretary , Winston Churchill .

The siege was the inspiration for the final shootout in Alfred Hitchcock ‘s original 1934
version of The Man Who Knew Too Much , although not his own 1956 remake .

The Houndsditch murders

On 16 December 1910, a gang of Latvian thieves attempted to break into the rear of a
jeweller’s shop at 119 Houndsditch , EC3 , working from 9, 10 and 11 Exchange Buildings in the
cul-de-sac behind. An adjacent shopkeeper heard their hammering, informed the City of
London Police (in whose area the shop was), and nine unarmed officers â€” three
sergeants and six constables (two in plain clothes ) â€” converged on Exchange
Buildings.

Sergeants Bentley and Bryant knocked at the door of No. 11 Exchange Buildings, unaware that
the first constable on the scene had already done so, thus alerting the thieves. The gang’s
leader, George Gardstein , opened the door, but when he did not answer their questions they
assumed he did not understand English and told him to fetch someone who did. Gardstein left the
door half-closed and disappeared.

The house consisted of a single ground-floor room, into which the front door directly opened,
with a staircase leading to the upper floors on the left, and a door to the open yard at the back on
the right. It was later deduced that Gardstein must have moved left towards the staircase,
since if he had gone right and out of the yard door he would have been seen by one of the
plain-clothed officers standing outside, who had a clear view of that side of the room.

Growing impatient, the two sergeants entered the house to find the room apparently empty,
before they became aware of a man standing in the darkness at the top of the stairs. After a short
conversation, another man entered through the yard door, rapidly firing a pistol , while the
man on the stairs also started shooting.

Both officers were hit, with Bentley collapsing across the doorstep, while Bryant managed to
stagger outside. In the street, Constable Woodhams ran to help Bentley, but was himself
wounded by one of the gang firing from the cover of the house, as was Sergeant Tucker, who died
almost instantly.

The gang then attempted to break out of the cul-de-sac, Gardstein being grabbed by Constable
Choate almost at the entrance. In the struggle Choate was wounded several times by Gardstein,
before being shot five more times by other members of the gang, who also managed to hit their
compatriot in the back. They then dragged Gardstein ÂŸ of a mile to 59 Grove Street, where he
died the next day. Constable Choate and Sergeant Bentley died in separate hospitals the same
day. An intense search followed, and a number of the gang or their associates were soon
arrested.

The Siege of Sidney Street

On 2 January 1911, an informant told police that two or three of the gang, possibly including
Peter the Painter himself, were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, Stepney (in the Metropolitan
Police District ). Worried that the suspects were about to flee, and expecting heavy
resistance to any attempt at capture, on 3 January, two hundred officers cordoned off the area
and the siege began. At dawn the battle commenced.

The defenders, though heavily outnumbered, possessed superior weapons and great stores of
ammunition . The Tower of London was called for backup, and word got to the Home Secretary ,
Winston Churchill , who arrived on the spot to observe the incident at first hand, and to offer
advice. Churchill authorised calling in a detachment of Scots Guards to assist the police.
Six hours into the battle, and just as the field artillery piece that Churchill had authorised
arrived, a fire began to consume the building. When the fire brigade arrived, Churchill
refused them access to the building. The police stood ready, guns aimed at the front door,
waiting for the men inside to attempt their escape. The door never opened. Instead, the
remains of two members of the gang, Fritz Svaars and William Sokolow (both were also known by
numerous aliases), were later discovered inside the building. No sign of Peter the Painter
was found. [1]

Aftermath

All the fatal shots in what became known as the “Houndsditch Murders” came from the same
Dreyse pistol belonging to Jacob Peters , but as he had left it with the mortally wounded
Gardstein to be found by the police, it was assumed to be his and that he was the killer. This was
despite the fact that Gardstein had completely different calibre ammunition for a Mauser C96
pistol both on him when he died and in his lodgings, but none at all for the Dreyse.
Gardstein’s “guilt” was further compounded by the mistaken belief that it was
Gardstein who had opened fire at 11 Exchange Buildings from the yard door, on the grounds that
it was he who had opened the front door to the police shortly before they were shot.

Of seven supposed members of the gang captured by the police, five men â€” including
Peters â€” and two women were put on trial, but they all either had their charges dropped,
were acquitted , or had their convictions quashed . Peters later returned home, and after the
October Revolution served as deputy head of the Cheka . He perished during the Great Purge in
1938.

The role Churchill played in the Sidney Street Siege was highly controversial at the time, and
many, including Arthur Balfour , the former prime minister , accused him of having acted
improperly. A famous photograph from the time shows Churchill peering around a corner to view
events. Balfour asked, “He [Churchill] and a photographer were both risking valuable
lives. I understand what the photographer was doing but what was the Right Honourable
gentleman doing?”

The gang’s superior firepower led the police to drop the Webley Revolver in favour of the
Webley semi-automatic in London.

On film

Much of the siege was captured by newsreel cameras, including the moment a bullet passed
through Mr Churchill’s top hat , coming within inches of killing him. This footage was later
shown at the Palace Theatre, London , under the billing, “Mr Churchill in the danger zone”

The siege was the inspiration for the final shootout in Alfred Hitchcock ‘s original 1934
version of The Man Who Knew Too Much , although not his own 1956 remake . The events were depicted
directly in the 1960 film The Siege of Sidney Street . [2]

In popular culture

The siege was parodied by the Goon Show in the episode The Six Ingots of Leadenhall Street ., [3]
[4] A bullet was supposedly fired which passed through Churchill’s hat, though this has
been dismissed by historians.

The events were portrayed fictionally in the Sherlock Holmes pastiche Sherlock Holmes and
the Railway Maniac by Barrie Roberts .

â€œTreasure of the Sierra Madreâ€�: Howardâ€™s Theory of Gold prices

Howard : Say, answer me this one, will you? Why is gold worth some twenty bucks an ounce?



Flophouse Bum : I don’t know. Because it’s scarce.



Howard : A thousand men, say, go searchin’ for gold. After six months, one of them’s lucky:
one out of a thousand. His find represents not only his own labor, but that of nine hundred and
ninety-nine others to boot. That’s six thousand months, five hundred years, scramblin’
over a mountain, goin’ hungry and thirsty. An ounce of gold, mister, is worth what it is
because of the human labor that went into the findin’ and the gettin’ of it.



Flophouse Bum : I never thought of it just like that.



Howard : Well, there’s no other explanation, mister. Gold itself ain’t good for nothing
except making jewelry with and gold teeth.

“The Last of The Just”

Lamedvavniks and Tzadikim Nistarim

According to Jewish tradition, 36 “just men” are born in every generation to take the
burden of the world’s suffering upon themselves.

The Tzadikim Nistarim (hidden righteous ones) or Lamed Vav Tzadikim (36 righteous ones),
often abbreviated to Lamed Vav(niks) [a] , refers to 36 Righteous people, a notion rooted
within the more mystical dimensions of Judaism . The singular form is Tzadik Nistar.

Origins

The source is the Talmud itself, explained as follows:

As a mystical concept, the number 36 is even more intriguing. It is said that at all times there
are 36 special people in the world, and that were it not for them, all of them, if even one of them
was missing, the world would come to an end. The two Hebrew letters for 36 are the lamed , which is
30, and the vav , which is 6. Therefore, these 36 are referred to as the Lamed-Vav Tzadikim . This
widely-held belief, this most unusual Jewish concept is based on a Talmudic statement to the
effect that in every generation 36 righteous “greet the Shechinah ,” the Divine Presence
(Tractate Sanhedrin 97b; Tractate Sukkah 45b). [1]

Their purpose

Mystical Hasidic Judaism as well as other segments of Judaism believe that there is the Jewish
tradition of 36 righteous people whose role in life is to justify the purpose of humankind in
the eyes of God. Tradition holds that their identities are unknown to each other and that, if
one of them comes to a realization of their true purpose then they may die and their role is
immediately assumed by another person:

The Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim are also called the Nistarim (“concealed ones”). In our folk
tales, they emerge from their self-imposed concealment and, by the mystic powers, which they
possess, they succeed in averting the threatened disasters of a people persecuted by the
enemies that surround them. They return to their anonymity as soon as their task is
accomplished, ‘concealing’ themselves once again in a Jewish community wherein they
are relatively unknown. The lamed-vavniks , scattered as they are throughout the Diaspora ,
have no acquaintance with one another. On very rare occasions, one of them is
‘discovered’ by accident, in which case the secret of their identity must not be
disclosed. The lamed-vavniks do not themselves know that they are ones of the 36. In fact,
tradition has it that should a person claim to be one of the 36, that is proof positive that they
are certainly not one. Since the 36 are each exemplars of anavah , (“humility”), having
such a virtue would preclude against oneâ€™s self-proclamation of being among the
special righteous. The 36 are simply too humble to believe that they are one of the 36. [1]

Lamedvavniks

Lamedvavnik is the Yiddish term for one of the 36 humble righteous ones or Tzadikim mentioned
in kabbalah or Jewish mysticism. According to this teaching, at any given time there are at
least 36 holy Jews in the world who are Tzadikim . These holy people are hidden; i.e., nobody
knows who they are. According to some versions of the story, they themselves may not know who
they are. For the sake of these 36 hidden saints, God preserves the world even if the rest of
humanity has degenerated to the level of total barbarism. This is similar to the story of Sodom
and Gomorrah in the Hebrew Bible , where God told Abraham that he would spare the city of Sodom if
there was a quorum of at least 10 righteous men. Since nobody knows who the Lamedvavniks are,
not even themselves, every Jew should act as if he or she might be one of them; i.e., lead a holy
and humble life and pray for the sake of fellow human beings. It is also said that one of these 36
could potentially be the Jewish Messiah if the world is ready for them to reveal themselves.
Otherwise, they live and die as an ordinary person. Whether the person knows they are the
potential Messiah is debated.

The term lamedvavnik is derived from the Hebrew letters Lamed (L) and Vav (V), whose numerical
value adds up to 36. The “nik” at the end is a Russian or Yiddish suffix indicating “a
person who…” (As in “ Beatnik “; in English, this would be something like calling them
“The Thirty-Sixers”.) The number 36 is twice 18.

In gematria (a form of Jewish numerology ), the number 18 stands for “life”, because the
Hebrew letters that spell chai , meaning “living”, add up to 18. Because 36 = 2Ã—18, it
represents “two lives”.

In some Hassidic stories, disciples consider their Rebbes and other religious figures to be
among the Lamedvavniks . It is also possible for a Lamedvavnik to reveal themselves as such,
although that rarely happensâ€”a Lamedvavnik’ s status as an exemplar of humility
would preclude it. More often, it is the disciples who speculate.

These beliefs are articulated in the works of Max Brod , and some (like Jorge Luis Borges )
believe the concept to have originated in the Book of Genesis 18:26

And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the
place for their sakes. [2]

    Notes

    - a In Hebrew numerals , 30 is lamed Â and 6 is va v â€Žâ€Ž. Together they yield
    36.

In this classic of 1959 AndrÃ© Schwarz-Bart reworks the Jewish legend of the Lamed Vavs, the
handful (36 in most versions of the story) of Just or Righteous Men who live among the Jews in
every generation and who provide the merit on which the world depends. The tradition dates
back to the 5th century Babylonian Talmud. It was elaborated by kabbalistic Jews in the 16th
and 17th century and by Hassidic Jews in the 18th century: the Lamed Vavs are humble men and
unnoticed as special by their fellow Jews. At times of great peril, so this version has it, “a
Lamed Vavnik makes a dramatic appearance, using his hidden powers to defeat the enemies of
Israel or mankind” ( Encyclopedia Judaica ).

Schwarz-Bart was born in France and lost most of the members of his family in the Holocaust.

Schwarz-Bart imagines the story of the Levys, one family in which the role of the Just Man was
hereditary. They have suffered death down the ages, beginning with the massacre of the Jews of
York in 1185. In later generations this wandering Jewish family suffers at the hands of the
Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions; they are expelled from one area after another; the
Cossacks add their contribution; and when we come to the late 19th century, the family leaves
its home in Zemyock in Russian Poland and settles in Germany. At this stage there are three
generations: at the head of it is Mordecai, the venerable patriarch, who accepts that all
suffering is part of God’s will and who tells his family that there is no point in putting up
any resistance. His son Benjamin thinks there is an escape in trying to merge into German
society; but the Patriarch tells the story of the Just Men to his frail and scholarly little
grandson, Ernie. Ernie lives in his own intensely active and romantic imagination, and, with
the arrival of the Nazis in 1933, he is convinced that he is to be the next Just Man.

The remaining two thirds of the book deal with Ernie’s life from that time onwards. There are
terrible scenes of brutality – gangs of Nazis attacking Jews as they go to the synagogue,
atrocious bullying of the Jewish children by a teacher and by their fellow-students.
Ernie’s life is full of suffering and strengthens his conviction that the calling of being
Just Man has indeed fallen upon him. The scenes of cruelty are interspersed with the vivid
poetical and mystical nature of Ernie’s imagination. With one terrible exception when he
is in utter despair – a touch of human nature which rescues the portrait of him from being just
too accepting – he identifies with suffering everywhere, not just among the Jews; he is open
to the beauties of the earth amid all the horrors that rage upon its surface. It is this lyrical
element of the book which sets it apart from so many other accounts of what happened to the Jews
under Nazi persecution.

Before the gates of the prison that was Nazi Germany finally slammed shut, the Levy family
managed to emigrate to France, only to be trapped there when the war broke out. Ernie
volunteers for the French army, though in a non-combatant role as a stretcher-bearer. The
horrors of war are described, not with the excruciating detail with which the author had dealt
with the brutality in Germany, but with Voltairian brevity and irony.

After the defeat of the French Army, Ernie manages to get into Vichy France. The instinct for
survival overcomes for a while his mission to become a martyr: he converts, he attends Mass, he
fornicates, he nearly begins to lose his Jewish appearance; but in his ever fertile fantasy he
sees himself as a dog and sometimes literally behaves like one. Anyway, his disguise does not
work: he is recognized as a Jew, and with that moment he recovers for himself his Jewish
identity.

He makes his way back to the Jewish quarter of Paris where he finds four devout old men from
Zemyock who have not yet been deported. Before his own deportation, old Mordecai had told them
that he believed his grandson to be one of the Just Men. Ernie is now treated by them with the
utmost reverence, and he becomes conscious again of his destiny.

But what will drive him to seek entry into the hell of Drancy and the extinction that awaits in
Auschwitz is not the consciousness that he is one of the Just Men, but something altogether
less mystical, more human. At one point in the heart-wrenching last pages, Ernie`s
compassion makes him tell the terrified children in the cattle-truck that they will soon be in
the Kingdom where “an eternal joy will crown your heads; cheerfulness and gaiety will come
and greet you, and all the pains and all the moans will run away.” He is reproved by an old woman
for not telling them the truth. He replies, “There is no room for truth here”. So will they
find the truth in the next world? Will they find an answer to the question that, in his dreams, he
heard a fiddler sing:

“Oh, can we rise as far as heaven

To ask God why things are as they are?”

The Last of the Just Â 

In 1959 The Last of the Just won the Prix Goncourt, the top literary award of France (the French
Booker). A sweeping epic of a thousand years of Jewish life in Europe, the novel traces the
fortunes and tragedies of one family with a special heritage. A member of each generation of
the family is one of the 36 just men that Jewish tradition claims feel the suffering and pain of
all the living, and without whom the world could not go on. Since the Jewish word for 36 is lamed
vov, these men are often called Lamed Vovniks.

This strange and singular honor was attributed to the Levy family in 1085 following an attempt
by the Bishop William of Nordhouse to massacre the Jewish citizens of York. To save his people,
the Rabbi Yom Tov Levy leads them to an abandoned tower where they withhold a siege of six days by
the local Christians. Rather than succumb to the indignities of their captors, the Jews
decide to take their own lives. As was done in Massada a thousand years earlier, the Rabbi takes
on the role of blessing and killing each of the members of his community and then taking his own
life. Some of the children, including the rabbi’s son Solomon, survive. When Solomon
becomes a man he has a vision from God where he is told that, because of his father’s noble act,
beginning with him, each generation of his family will contain one of the Lamed-Vovniks .

The first 140 pages of this book presents a history of the Levy family, their lineage of
Lamed-Vovniks , and their fame in the Jewish community. The last three hundred pages tells the
story of Ernie Levy, who is born in the Twentieth Century, during the events leading up to and in
the Holocaust.

Sweeping in scope and yet focused on the life of a single man, this book presents the joys of
Jewish community life and the accomodations they make to survive being a European minority
marked for extermination by the Christian majority. It presents European history from a
Jewish perspective and provides a detailed background to the insanity that is the Holocaust.

The point of view is that of a family of holy men whose compassion and wisdom gives the story
great depth and understanding. Sadly, the Levy Lamed-Vovniks are all male. While the women of
the story are well portrayed and strong personalities, they are never the main characters so
the book has a decidedly male perspective.Â 

There are in the world 36 `just men’ that take on the suffering of the world, that are the
reasons God allows the world to continue. There are among these men, some number of `unknown
just’ who see the world differently from most of us.

That when one of these `unknown just’ dies his soul is so cold that God must hold him in his
fingers for a thousand years so that he can open to paradise.

Ernie Levy in The Last of the Just is one of those men. A thousand years of history, two thousand
years of suffering are all concentrated in the story of one boy, the movement of a family from
Poland, to Germany, to France, to extermination. The story of a people, the story of a family,
the story of a man, the story of the twentieth century.

The Last of the Just

Since the Palestinians are today’s “Jews” , “The Last of the Just” should impel all
Jews to support the Palestinians.

Â  3rd Gulf African Bank Annual East & Central Africa Islamic Finance Conference, Nairobi,
28 March 2011.

Â Njuguna Ndungâ€™u: Islamic finance â€“ a paradigm shift in Africa

Remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndungâ€™u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the 3rd Gulf
African Bank Annual East & Central Africa Islamic Finance Conference, Nairobi, 28 March
2011.

Mr. Suleiman Shahbal, Chairman, Gulf African Bank Ltd;

Mr. Najmul Hassan, Chief Executive Officer, Gulf African Bank Ltd;

Board Members of Gulf African Bank Ltd here present;

Distinguished Guests;

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am delighted and honoured to have been invited to preside over the opening ceremony of this
important conference. At the onset, let me extend a warm welcome to all participants
attending the 3rd Gulf African Bank Annual East and Central Africa Islamic Finance
Conference, with the theme: â€œIslamic Finance: A Paradigm Shift in Africaâ€�

Allow me to compliment Gulf African Bank for organising this Islamic Finance Conference.
Indeed, this landmark conference brings together financial experts, central bankers,
financial regulators, lawyers, financial institutions and Islamic banking consumers from
Kenya and beyond. To all international participants, let me extend a particularly hearty
welcome, â€œKaribuni Kenyaâ€� .

This conference gives participants the opportunity to discuss emerging industry
developments as well as reflect on the gains and challenges since the last Islamic Finance
Conference held in May last year.

Ladies and Gentlemen: Sharia compliant banking is viewed by many as the fastest growing
segment of the banking sector in the world. In Africa, Islamic banking is a fast growing
financial sector attracting all customers even of different religious orientation.

The uptake of Islamic banking is projected to grow exponentially in sub-Saharan Africa.
Kenya is among other African countries, that are taking up the lead in Sharia compliant
banking services.

Today, Sharia compliant banking services in Kenya have made huge strides since its
introduction in 2007. The banking sector boasts of two exclusively Sharia compliant banks.
As at the financial year ended December 31, 2010 the two banks collectively commanded a market
share of 0.9% of the banking sector with gross assets of Ksh.16.54bn, net loans and advances of
Ksh.9.23bn and deposits of Ksh.13.76bn. The two banks had 58,101 deposit accounts and 2,609
loan accounts as at the end of December 2010 â€“ in less than 4 years of operation.

In addition, several conventional banks now offer Sharia compliant products as part of their
product range through specifically created Islamic banking divisions or windows. Other
conventional banks have also expressed interest in providing Sharia compliant products to
an increasing customer base.

Ladies and Gentlemen: Among the challenges facing Kenyaâ€™s ambition to be a hub of
Sharia compliant investment products to compliment the Islamic banking in the country are
lack of; Shariah compliant investment vehicles, an enabling legal and regulatory framework
and awareness by majority of the populace that hinder the uptake of these investments.

For the country to fully embrace Islamic Finance, there is need to extend beyond the offering
of Sharia compliant products by introducing such investment vehicles like unit trusts,
corporate bonds (sukuks) and insurance (takaful) products and Sharia compliant treasury
bills and bonds (government Sukuk).

It is encouraging to note the ongoing efforts by the Government and other players especially
the Capital Markets Authority and Insurance Regulatory Authority to come up with a range of
shariah compliant financial products. Already there are positive signals of these efforts
with the introduction of Shariah compliant investments and Insurance Products.

It is in this spirit that the Kenyan government through the Finance Act 2010, amended Section
45 of the Central Bank of Kenya Act, to allow the Central Bank as the Governmentâ€™s
fiscal agent to recognize the payment of a â€œreturnâ€� rather than
â€œinterestâ€� on government securities. This amendment opens up the spectrum of
Sharia compliant investments in the country.

Ladies and Gentlemen: The future of Islamic finance in Kenya and in the region remains bright.
On its part, the Government of Kenya will continue to pursue policies that create an enabling
environment that will eventually culminate in Kenya establishing itself as a regional
financial hub as envisaged in Vision 2030. In addition, the Central Bank will continue to
partner with the sector to promote financial inclusion by supporting innovation in the
Sharia compliant banking sector.

With these few remarks, let me wish all participants to this conference, fruitful
deliberations over the next two days and declare the 3rd Gulf African Bank Annual East and
Central African Islamic Conference officially opened.

Thank You.

Product Description:



A revised second edition of the text, this work explores the way in which a new approach to the
cinema can be combined with a new approach to aesthetics. The book is divided into three main
sections: the first deals with the work of S.M. Eisenstein, both as a director and theorist of
his art. The second concerns the auteur theory and investigates the recurrence of themes and
images throughout a director’s career. The third section shows how the study of cinema can
be considered as a province of the general study of signs.

Gaston Palewski (20 March 1901 – 3 September 1984)

Gaston Palewski (20 March 1901 – 3 September 1984), French politician, was a close
associate of Charles de Gaulle during and after World War II .

He is also remembered as the lover of the English novelist Nancy Mitford , and appears in a
fictionalized form in two of her novels.

Biography

Palewski was born in Paris , the son of an industrialist. His family was of Polish origin and had
lived in France since the 19th century. He was educated at the Sorbonne , at the Ecole des
Sciences Politiques and at Oxford University – he spoke excellent English and was a
convinced Anglophile . Using family connections, he obtained a post with Marshal Hubert
Lyautey , the French Resident-General in Morocco . In 1928 he became principal private
secretary to Paul Reynaud , a leading politician who was then Minister for Finances and who
became Prime Minister of France in March 1940. Through Reynaud, in 1934, he first met Charles
de Gaulle, and became a supporter of his political and military views.

On the outbreak of war in 1939 Palewski was commissioned as a lieutenant in the French Air Force
, and saw action following the German invasion of France in May 1940. He was in French North
Africa at the time of the armistice of June 1940. Refusing to accept France’s defeat, he
reached London at the end of August and joined de Gaulle’s Free French Forces . De Gaulle
appointed him Director of Political Affairs of the Free French movement, and he played a
leading role in negotiations between de Gaulle and the British government, which at first
regarded de Gaulle with scepticism. In March 1941 he was given the rank of lieutenant-colonel
and command of the Free French Army in East Africa, leading it against the Italian forces
during the recapture of French Somaliland (now Djibouti ).

In September 1942, he was recalled to London to become de Gaulle’s “Directeur du
Cabinet,” a post in which he followed de Gaulle from London to Algiers in 1943 and then in
August 1944 to liberated Paris.

He became known as de Gaulle’s “homme de confiance” (right-hand man), and his
diplomatic skills and knowledge of the English made him invaluable to de Gaulle, who neither
understood nor trusted them.

Palewski remained director of the de Gaulle’s cabinet (that is, his private office) until
de Gaulle’s resignation as head of the Provisional Government in January 1946.

He then became a leading proponent of Gaullism and one of the founders of the first Gaullist
party, the Rassemblement du Peuple FranÃ§ais (Rally of the French People, or RPF) in 1947.
In 1951 he was elected to the National Assembly as an RPF deputy for the Department of the Seine
(Paris). From 1953 to 1955 he was vice-president of the National Assembly. Following the
failure of the RPF, however, he withdrew from politics. In 1957, at de Gaulle’s request, he
was appointed Ambassador to Italy, a post he held until 1962. In 1962 Palewski was appointed by
Prime Minister George Pompidou as Minister of State in charge of Scientific Research, Atomic
Energy and Space Questions, the first French minister with specific responsibility for such
matters. On 1 May 1962 Palewski witnessed the French underground nuclear test codenamed
“Beryl” in Algeria. The test shaft failed to contain the blast and he was exposed to
radiation as result of a leak of radioactive lava and dust into the atmosphere. He believed
that the leukemia which he contracted later in life was caused by this accident. [1] From 1965
to 1974 he was President of the Constitutional Council of France . Palewski died of leukaemia
in 1984, aged 83.

Decorations and honorary positions

After 1974 he held a number of honorary posts. An amateur painter of some talent, he was a member
of the AcadÃ©mie des Beaux-Arts .

    Because of his high office and his record in the war Palewski was awarded several French
    decorations. After his term as an ambassador to the Italian government, not to the Holy
    See , he was awarded an Italian Grand Cross.

    - The Grand Croix of the LÃ©gion d’Honneur ,

    

    - The title and cross of a Compagnon de la LibÃ©ration ,

    

    - The Croix de Guerre (twice),

    

    - The MÃ©daille Coloniale , with a bar

    

    - The Croix du combattant volontaire 1939â€“1945 .

    

    - The Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic

    



Character

In his personal life, Palewski was a notorious and reckless womaniser, and this earned him a
reputation for frivolity that damaged his prospects for a serious political career. Only his
standing with de Gaulle, to whom he was devoted and totally loyal, enabled him to hold high
office. During the war in London he met the English writer and society figure Nancy Mitford ,
and began with her a long, passionate but intermittent affair. They were separated during the
latter part of the war, but in 1946 she moved permanently to Paris, and their relationship,
though never public, lasted until her death in 1973. This did not prevent him becoming
involved with many other women. In 1969, without formally ending his affair with Mitford –
he was with her when she died – he married Helen-Violette de Talleyrand-PÃ©rigord
(1915â€“2003), duchesse de Sagan, the daughter of the seventh duc de Talleyrand and his
wife Anna Gould . The two had been having a long affair prior to the duchesse’s divorce from
her first husband and had had a son out of wedlock.

In the English-speaking world Palewski is known chiefly through his appearance as Fabrice,
duc de Sauveterre, in two of Nancy Mitford’s novels, The Pursuit of Love (1945) and Love in a
Cold Climate (1949). The first of these contains a fairly accurate portrayal of their
relationship, although it is moved from postwar to prewar Paris. Despite Mitford’s love
for Palewski, she depicted him in a very clear-eyed way in these novels, with no attempt to
disguise his many infidelities. He took no offence at this, and when Mitford proposed to
dedicate The Pursuit of Love to “The Colonel,” he insisted on his real name being used.
