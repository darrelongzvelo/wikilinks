Frank Clair , the Canadian Football League (CFL) coach and architect of the powerhouse Ottawa
Rough Riders of the 1960s and 70s died Sunday at the age of 87 in Sarasota, Florida , United
States .

Nicknamed "The Professor" for his skills at recognising talent, teaching the game, and
ability to get the most from players, Clair first came to Canada to coach the Toronto Argonauts
in 1950 and ended his first CFL year with a Grey Cup championship; repeating with the Argos in
1952. He left the Argonauts following a salary dispute and ended up in Ottawa in 1956 where he
took on the daunting task of reviving the Rough Riders team which were poorly run and
disorganised. He led the team to an incredible 14 consecutive seasons of playoff appearances
and three Grey Cups.

He retired from coaching following the 1969 Grey Cup to take over the general manager
position. At that time, Clair led the CFL in seasons coached (19), regular-season victories
(147), playoff seasons (17), consecutive playoff seasons (14), playoff victories (22),
Grey Cup appearances (six) and Grey Cup victories (five). His winning ways continued as GM
when Ottawa won the 1973 and 1976 Grey Cups. Nevertheless, he was let go in 1978 and Ottawa has
not won a Grey Cup since.

According to the Ottawa Sun , former sports editor Jane O'Hara described Clair as a
no-nonsense, to-the-point, type of gentleman who was short on smiles, but always seen
coaching his team wearing a snap-brim fedora and standing poker-faced and erect on the
sidelines.

He was inducted into the CFL Hall of Fame in 1981 as a builder and the Ottawa stadium ( Frank Clair
Stadium at Lansdowne Park ) was renamed in his honour in 1993.
