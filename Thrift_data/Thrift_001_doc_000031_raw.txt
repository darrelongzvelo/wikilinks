Playbill.com- Top Stories for 2010!

The Year in Theatre: From Sondheim to Spider-Man , Playbill.com Picks the Top Stories of 2010
By Kenneth Jones  23 Dec 2010

The editors and writers of Playbill.com put their heads together this month and looked back at
the events of 2010 to choose significant news stories that made headlines and touched the
industry uniquely.

The Year of Sondheim: He Is a Parade!  The master American musical theatre
composer-lyricist Stephen Sondheim turned 80 years old on March 22, and the milestone was
celebrated around the world with revivals of his musicals ( Passion and Into the Woods in
London, an all-male Forum at Williamstown Theatre Festival, the continuing A Little Night
Music on Broadway), the premiere of a new revue ( Sondheim on Sondheim , created James Lapine,
on Broadway), concerts (for the BBC in London, by New York Pops at Carnegie Hall, by the New York
Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall, by Roundabout Theatre Company, by Encores! at New York
City Center, among others), public on-stage interviews (in New York City and Toronto) and the
re-naming of a Broadway theatre ( Henry Miller's Theatre was named the Stephen Sondheim,
unveiled in September ). In October, "Finishing the Hat," the first volume of his collected
lyrics (1954-81) , was published, offering readers not just verse, but lively reflections on
his work and mini-essays about the major (dead) theatre lyricists of the last century. The
Tony Award-winning, Pulitzer Prize-honored songwriter of Sweeney Todd, A Little Night
Music, Follies, A Funny Thing Happened, Merrily We Roll Along and Sunday in the Park With
George, among others, spoke to Playbill.com in November , saying he's looking forward to the
calm of 2011, because "nobody celebrates your 81st."

Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey photo by Aubrey Reuben

A Serious Success: Next to Normal Wins the Pulitzer Prize : The already Tony Award-winning
rock musical Next to Normal by composer Tom Kitt and lyricist-librettist Brian Yorkey won the
2010 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama . The Pulitzer board decided to award the honor to
Normal rather than one of the three finalists chosen by a jury ( The Elaborate Entrance of Chad
Deity by Kristoffer Diaz ; Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo by Rajiv Joseph ; and In the Next Room
or the vibrator play by Sarah Ruhl ). The Pulitzer folk recognized the work for its subject
matter (in it, a suburban mom struggling with grief and mental illness creates earthquakes in
her family, and she seeks relief in electroconvulsive therapy), saying that it "expands the
scope of subject matter for musicals." After the April announcement, jury members went
public about being overridden by the board . Also touching on serious subject matter
(interracial love in the American South of the late 1950s, albeit with a happy-ending
production number) was the pop musical Memphis , by Joe DiPietro and David Bryan , which was
named Best Musical at the 2010 Tony Awards.

Ambitious Topics, Short Broadway Lives  The history of theatre is packed with examples of
unlikely subject matter hitting it big at the box office: Evita, anyone? Sweeney Todd ?
Richard III ? In 2010, three Broadway shows plucked people and events from history, but
audiences did not support their resurrection (even if some critics did). The Scottsboro Boys
, the final musical that the songwriting team of Kander & Ebb worked on before Ebb's death, told
the story of the "Scottsboro case," in which nine African-American males under the age of 20
were wrongly convicted of rape in 1931 Alabama. And, its theatrical frame was a minstrel show,
the controversial and outdated entertainment known for racial stereotypes and blackface
(reworked to criticize the injustice). Some critics embraced it as The Best Musical of the
Year, but it closed on Broadway six weeks after it opened (though there is talk of a return in
2011 .) Enron , Lucy Prebble 's London hit that pokes American greed in the eye by adding song,
dance, projections and mask work to tell the story of the fall of the famed energy corporation,
was a quick Broadway flop. Likewise, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson , Michael Friedman and Alex
Timbers ' antic downtown musical — equal parts sketch comedy, underground rock concert and
a revisionist history lesson — about the notorious U.S. president, was a critics' darling,
but was not supported on Broadway. It closes Jan. 2, 2011, two-and-a-half months after
opening.

A scene from  Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark photo by Jacob Cohl

A Web of Intrigue: Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark  The $65 million Broadway musical
Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark , directed by  Julie Taymor , with songs by Bono and The Edge , was
originally to begin previews at the Hilton Theatre in January 2010 prior to a February
opening, but a cash-flow problem put summer 2009 rehearsals on hold. New producer Michael
Cohl stepped in, work continued, some actors pulled out, the massive Hilton — which was
renovated to accommodate Taymor's cirque vision for the comic-book show — was renamed the
Foxwoods Theatre, actors were injured in rehearsal, previews continued to be delayed. And
then it began on Nov. 28. A "60 Minutes" feature on Taymor's ambitious show offered national
exposure and goosed the box office. More actors were injured, this time in performance (
including a stuntman plunge that prompted investigations by state officials and unions, and
made international headlines ). Changes to the script and score are expected before the
official opening of Feb. 7, 2011. You can't look away, can you? Neither can the crowd: The
Foxwoods box office for the week ending Dec. 19 hit $1,036,133, representing 98.9 percent
capacity and an average ticket price of $90.

Elaine Stritch and Bernadette Peters in A Little Night Music photo by Joan Marcus

Passing the Crowns and "Send in the Clowns"  Broadway's A Little Night Music starring
Catherine Zeta-Jones (who won a Tony Award for her work) and Angela Lansbury (beloved for
Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd ) was announced to close in early summer at the end of its
leading ladies' contracts. And then the unthinkable happened. Sondheim and the producers
urged Bernadette Peters and Elaine Stritch — two other leading ladies with strong ties to
legendary Sondheim shows — to take over the roles. They said yes, adding six months to the run
of the Trevor Nunn -directed production (and allowing Stritch as Madame Armfeldt to say a
famous line that the actress also uttered in Company : "I'd like to propose a toast!").

Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess in Love Never Dies photo by Catherine Ashmore

Phantom of the Opera Gets a Sequel   Andrew Lloyd Webber 's Love Never Dies , the pop-opera
sequel to the international smash The Phantom of the Opera, opened in London to a raft of
negative reviews on March 9. In the new tale, the Phantom and his favorite soprano, Christine,
have resurfaced in Coney Island, NY. A gunshot at the climax of the show was probably not what
fans were hoping for. A Broadway bow in fall 2010 was bumped to spring 2011, and has since been
taken off the schedule. The London production shut down for several days in November to allow
for rewrites and revisions. Critics are invited back. The wildly popular Phantom,
meanwhile, continues as Broadway's longest-running musical (and remains a fixture in
London and Las Vegas; the 18-year-old U.S. national tour closed on Oct. 31 in Los Angeles).

Lea Michele in "Glee" photo by FOX-TV

"Glee" Mania!  Why is the popular FOX TV series "Glee" one of our Top Theatre Stories of the
Year? Because it's wildly popular with our readership . Because it borrows musical theatre
conventions — characters singing in presentational sequences as high-school glee club
performers and in representational moments as emotionally conflicted characters. Because
it swipes songs from the pop catalog as well as the musical theatre songbook (a gay boy sings
"Rose's Turn"? Sign us up!). Because it's likely to populate future Broadway shows with its
stars ( Lea Michele as Funny Girl ?). Because it will influence a new generation of kids to care
about telling stories with songs. But, mostly, because it's Sondheim approved. When we
suggested to the master that the songs in "Glee" often seem too unconnected to plot, he told us:
"That's part of the fun of it, when they use the music right and freshly and it is in some way
connected to plot — even if it's just emotionally, even if the lyric doesn't seem to be
connected to plot, but the feeling of the song is. I like that. Obviously, it's very up and down,
the episodes I've seen — even within the episodes they're up and down. In a way, it's a very
daring show, and they are taking chances, and a lot of it is whimsical in the true sense of the
word."

Spiderman Turn Off the Dark -Injury Update Christopher Tierney





CBS NEWS CLIP HERE:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbquv3CDMDM







1:30 Update: Video of SPIDER-MAN Injury; Actor Identified; Equity to Halt Performances;
Investigation Underway

Tuesday, December 21, 2010; Posted: 09:12 AM - by BroadwayWorld TV

Twitter was flooded last night shortly after 10:40 PM with messages from audience members at
SPIDER-MAN, with word that an actor fell during the middle of Act 2 when a cable snapped. The
show was first put on hold, and then cancelled as ambulances arrived on the scene. This
morning, the actor has been identified as aerialist Christopher Tierney, who is reported to
be in serious, but stable condition.

At 11:29 AM, Equity has released a statement that "Actors' Equity Association is working with
management and the Department of Labor to ensure that performances will not resume until
back-up safety measures are in place."

BroadwayWorld has learned from several sources that SPIDER-MAN stuntman Christopher
Tierney has suffered several broken ribs and bleeding after his nearly 30-foot free fall on
the SPIDEY set last night.  Fortunately, Tierney landed such that he avoided any crippling
neck or spinal injury.  He is still being held at the hospital in serious, but stable
condition.

We've now confirmed with a production source that representatives from the Department of
Labor and from Equity are now onsite at the Foxwoods Theatre meeting with members of the show's
production team, stage hands and crew.

They will also be examining all of the equipment used during the show as they attempt to
determine if last night's problems were caused by human error, technical problems or a
combination thereof. It's expected that once their decision is reached, Equity and the
production will make their determination as to what will be needed to deem the production
safe, and then they can estimate how long that might take before they determine when
performances will be resumed.

All of the equipment and stunts were examined before the show began performances. Stay tuned
to BroadwayWorld.com, which was the first to report the goings on last night and will bring you
more information as soon as it's available.

Earlier, Actors Equity released a short statement about last night's incident, stating that
"We were informed shortly after the accident during the performance of Spiderman. We are
working in cooperation with the state and city Department of Labor on this situation. We dont
have a further statement at this time."

BroadwayWorld.com has also confirmed that the New York State Department of Labor will visit
the Foxwoods Theater this morning for its own investigation into what occurred last night
that will involve interviews with the production team, as well as a check of all equipment to
determine if it was a human or technical error.

Many performers have contacted BroadwayWorld.com both last night and this morning, urging
actors to contact the union individually to suggest that they 'step in' and get more involved
with protecting the safety of the actors in this production.

Fellow actress, Natalie Mendoza, who herself received a concussion in the show wrote on her
Twitter after 4am in response: "Please pray with me for my friend Chris, my superhero who
quietly inspires me everyday with his spirit. A light in my heart went dim tonight."

BroadwayWorld was the first to report on the incident as we spoke to an audience member who was
there, and told us that the incident occurred near the end of the show when the bridge comes down
with MJ suspended in the air and Spider-Man goes after her. Basically, she went down and it
seemed he went jumping after her. Then you saw the rope come down and then snap back up. Then all
of a sudden, the stage manager's voice came on and said that there was going to be a pause. The
theatre then stayed dark for a minute or two and then they called the show and brought the house
lights back up.

Our source told us that for most of the audience, there was a moment of "did I really just see
that?" foliowed by horror and concern. Coming from where the actor fell, a voice was heard
screaming, as well, which was believed to be lead actress Jennifer Damiano's voice. As
audience members left the theatre, at least one ambulance and fire truck were seen.

Another audience member contacted us to tell us that "The person taken away was the person
playing Spider-Man at the time. He tried to get up and stagehands told him not to move. I was in
the audience and I'm an NY EMT. Although I am not involved with the care of the patient they
didn't use a back-board and collar as they brought him out. The ambulance stayed on site longer
then expected, which would lead me to believe the injury isn't critical."

This is the show's fourth injury and there's no word on what affect this will have on future
performances.  Two shows are scheduled for Spider-Man on Wednesday, there is no word at this
time if performances will be cancelled.

Last night, a representative for the show tells us that "An actor sustained an injury at
tonight's performance of Spider-Man Turn Off The Dark. He fell several feet from a platform
approximately seven minutes before the end of the performance, and the show was stopped. All
signs were good as he was taken to the hospital for observation. We will have more news
shortly."

We're told via a stagehand that this was NOT a flying sequence and that Spider-Man was NOT
supposed to drop at all. He was supposed to run to top of the ramp as if to jump with the lights then
set to go to black. The cable that snapped is what stops him from going over the edge, and that is
what failed. He then fell approximately 30 feet.

Julie Taymor Issues Statement on SPIDER-MAN Safety

Tuesday, December 21, 2010; Posted: 08:12 PM - by BWW News Desk

Director Julie Taymor has just released the following statement: "An accident like this is
obviously heartbreaking for our entire team and, of course, to me personally. I am so thankful
that Chris is going to be alright and is in great spirits. Nothing is more important than the
safety of our Spider-Man family and we'll continue to do everything in our power to protect the
cast and crew."

An official statement was earlier issued from the production which says that "OSHA
(Occupational Safety and Health Administration), Actors Equity and the New York State
Department of Labor have met with the Spider-Man company today to discuss additional safety
protocols. It was agreed that these measures would be enacted immediately.

Tomorrow's matinee has been postponed and will be rescheduled.

Tomorrow evening's, and all subsequent performances will proceed as scheduled."

Twitter was flooded last night shortly after 10:40 PM with messages from audience members at
SPIDER-MAN, with word that an actor fell during the middle of Act 2 when a cable snapped. The
show was first put on hold, and then cancelled as ambulances arrived on the scene. This
morning, the actor has been identified as aerialist Christopher Tierney, who is reported to
be in serious, but stable condition. The actor has suffered several broken ribs and internal
bleeding after his nearly 30-foot free fall on the SPIDEY set last night. Fortunately,
Tierney landed such that he avoided any crippling neck or spinal injury. He is still being held
at the hospital in serious, but stable condition.

4PM Update: Christopher Tierney's Condition Still Serious

Wednesday, December 22, 2010; Posted: 02:12 PM - by BWW News Desk

BroadwayWorld has confirmed with hospital sources that Christopher Tierney, the Spiderman
stuntman who fell nearly 30 feet from a raised platform during the December 20th performance,
still remains in serious condition at New York's Bellevue Hospital. He is being watched
regularly and is reportedly in good spirits. 

There is no word on how long he must remain at Bellevue. He is able to talk and move slightly and,
as CBS reported last night, he recorded a video message which was then played for the rest of the
cast. Unconfirmed reports have said that Tierney underwent successful surgery earlier this
afternoon for "3 broken vertebrate / his sacrum."

Late last evening, Director Julie Taymor released the following statement: "An accident
like this is obviously heartbreaking for our entire team and, of course, to me personally. I am
so thankful that Chris is going to be alright and is in great spirits. Nothing is more important
than the safety of our Spider-Man family and we'll continue to do everything in our power to
protect the cast and crew."

Images That Changed the World



Images That Changed The World ?









Some people might be offended or upset by these images but this isn't my intentions I just want
it to be thought provoking and enlightening, and for people to talk about the past and to never
forget, because we need to learn from past events other wise we will keep repeating history. 





If the image has a link it will take you to a  video/documentary  about the history of the
image and the title of the image will take you to  Wikipedia .



Execution of a Viet Cong Guerrilla [1968]

This picture was shot by Eddie Adams who won the Pulitzer prize with it. The picture shows
Nguyen Ngoc Loan, South Vietnam's national police chief executing a prisoner who was said to
be a Viet Cong captain. Once again the public opinion was turned against the war.

The lynching of young blacks [1930]

This is a famous picture, taken in 1930, showing the young black men accused of raping a
Caucasian woman and killing her boyfriend, hanged by a mob of 10,000 white men. The mob took
them by force from the county jail house. Another black man was left behind and ended up being
saved from lynching. Even if lynching photos were designed to boost white supremacy, the
tortured bodies and grotesquely happy crowds ended up revolting many.

Soweto Uprising [1976] It was a picture that got the world's attention: A frozen moment in time
that showed 13-year-old Hector Peterson dying after being struck down by a policeman's
bullet.

Hazel Bryant [1957]

It was the fourth school year since segregation had been outlawed by the Supreme Court. Things
were not going well, and some southerners accused the national press of distorting matters.
This picture, however, gave irrefutable testimony, as Elizabeth Eckford strides through a
gantlet of white students, including Hazel Bryant (mouth open the widest), on her way to
Little Rock's Central High.

Triangle Shirtwaist Company Fire [1911] The Triangle Shirtwaist Company always kept its
doors locked to ensure that the young immigrant women stayed stooped over their machines and
didn't steal anything. When a fire broke out on Saturday, March 25, 1911, on the eighth floor of
the New York City factory, the locks sealed the workers' fate. In just 30 minutes, 146 were
killed. Witnesses thought the owners were tossing their best fabric out the windows to save
it, then realized workers were jumping, sometimes after sharing a kiss (the scene can be
viewed now as an eerie precursor to the World Trade Center events of September, 11, 2001, only a
mile and a half south). The Triangle disaster spurred a national crusade for workplace
safety.

Phan ThÃ¡»‹ Kim PhÃƒÂºc [1972]

Phan ThÃ¡»‹ Kim PhÃƒÂºc known as Kim Phuc (born 1963) was the subject of a famous
photo from the Vietnam war. The picture shows her at about age nine running naked after being
severely burned on her back by a napalm attack.

Kent State [1970]

The news that Richard Nixon was sending troops to Cambodia caused a chain of protests in the
U.S. colleges. At Kent State the protest seemed more violent, some students even throwing
rocks. In consequence, The Ohio National Guard was called to calm things down, but the events
got out of hand and they started shooting. Some of the victims were simply walking to school.
The photo shows 14-year-old   Mary Ann Vecchio   kneeling over the body of Jeffrey Miller who
had been shot by the Ohio National Guard moments earlier.

Tiananmen Square [1989]

This is the picture of a student/man going to work who has just had enough. The days leading up to
this event thousands of protesters and innocent by standers were killed by their own
government because the Chinese people wanted more rights. He tries to stop the tanks in
Tiananmen Square by standing in front of them and blocking them from passing, the tank driver
didn't crush the man with the bags as a group of unknown people came and dragged him away, we
still don't know if the man is alive or dead as the Chinese government executed many of the
protesters involved. China is still controlled by a communist regime.

There are two well know photos taken of the protester by two different photojournalist, so I
thought I would show both images and give both photographer credit for there work as many
people think that both images where taken by the same person.

ThÃƒ ch QuÃ¡Âº£ng Ã„�Ã¡»©c [1963]

ThÃƒ ch QuÃ¡Âº£ng Ãƒ�Ã¡»©c was a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who burned
himself to death at a busy Saigon intersection on June 11, 1963. His act of self-immolation,
which was repeated by others, was witnessed by David Halberstam, a New York Times reporter,
who wrote:



    

" I was to see that sight again, but once was enough. Flames were coming from a human being; his
body was slowly withering and shriveling up, his head blackening and charring. In the air was
the smell of burning human flesh; human beings burn surprisingly quickly. Behind me I could
hear the sobbing of the Vietnamese who were now gathering. I was too shocked to cry, too
confused to take notes or ask questions, too bewildered to even think.... As he burned he never
moved a muscle, never uttered a sound, his outward composure in sharp contrast to the wailing
people around him."

Portrait of Winston Churchill [1941]

This photograph was taken by Yousuf Karsh, a Canadian photographer, when Winston Churchill
came to Ottawa. The portrait of Churchill brought Karsh international fame. It is claimed to
be the most reproduced photographic portrait in history. It also appeared on the cover of Life
magazine.

Albert Einstein [1951] Albert Einstein is probably one of the most popular figures of all
times. He is considered a genius because he created the Theory of Relativity, and so,
challenged Newton's laws, that were the basis of everything known in physics until the
beginning of the 20th century. But, as a person, he was considered a beatnik, and this picture,
taken on March 14, 1951 proves that.

Nagasaki [1945] This is the picture of the "mushroom cloud" showing the enormous quantity of
energy. The first atomic bomb was released on August 6 in Hiroshima (Japan) and killed about
80,000 people. On August 9 another bomb was released above Nagasaki. The effects of the second
bomb were even more devastating - 150,000 people were killed or injured. But the powerful
wind, the extremely high temperature and radiation caused enormous long term damage.

Hiroshima, Three Weeks After the Bomb [1945]

Americans -- and everyone -- had heard of the bomb that "leveled" Hiroshima, but what did that
mean? When the aerial photography was published, that question was answered.

Dead on the Beach [1943]

Haunting photograph of a beach in Papua New Guinea on September 20, 1943, the magazine felt
compelled to ask in an adjacent full-page editorial, "Why print this picture, anyway, of
three American boys dead upon an alien shore?" Among the reasons: "words are never enough . . .

Buchenwald [1945] George Patton's troops when they liberated the Buchenwald concentration
camp. Forty-three thousand people had been murdered there. Patton was so outraged he ordered
his men to march German civilians through the camp so they could see with their own eyes what
their nation had wrought.

Anne Frank [1941] Six million Jews died in the Holocaust. For many throughout the world, one
teenage girl gave them a story and a face. She was Anne Frank, the adolescent who, according to
her diary, retained her hope and humanity as she hid with her family in an Amsterdam attic. In
1944 the Nazis, acting on a tip, arrested the Franks; Anne and her sister died of typhus at
Bergen-Belsen only a month before the camp was liberated. The world came to know her through
her words and through this ordinary portrait of a girl of 14. She stares with big eyes, wearing
an enigmatic expression, gazing at a future that the viewer knows will never come.

V-J Day, Times Square, [1945]

or "The Kiss", at the end of World War II, in US cities everybody went to the streets to salute the
end of combat. Friendship and unity were everywhere. This picture shows a sailor kissing a
young nurse in Times Square. The fact is he was kissing every girl he encountered and for that
kiss, this particular nurse slapped him.

Casualties of war [1991]

Image of a young US sergeant at the moment he learns that the body bag next to him contains the
body of his friend, killed by "friendly fire".



The widely published photo became an iconic image of the 1991 Gulf war - a war in which media
access was limited by Pentagon restrictions.

The Falling Man [2001]

The powerful and controversial photograph provoked feelings of anger, particularly in the
United States, in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The photo ran only once
in many American newspapers because they received critical and angry letters from readers
who felt the photo was exploitative, voyeuristic, and disrespectful of the dead. This led to
the media's self-censorship of the photograph, preferring instead to print photos of acts of
heroism and sacrifice.



Drew commented about the varying reactions, saying, "This is how it affected people's lives
at that time, and I think that is why it's an important picture. I didn't capture this person's
death. I captured part of his life. This is what he decided to do, and I think I preserved
that."9/11: The Falling Man ends suggesting that this picture was not a matter of the identity
behind the man, but how he symbolized the events of 9/11.

U.S. Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima [1945]

Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima is a historic photograph taken on February 23, 1945, by Joe
Rosenthal. It depicts five United States Marines and a U.S. Navy corpsman raising the flag of
the United States atop Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II.



The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later,
it became the only photograph to win the Pulitzer Prize for Photography in the same year as its
publication, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and
recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all times.

Lunch atop a Skyscraper [1932]

Lunch atop a Skyscraper (New York Construction Workers Lunching on a Crossbeam) is a famous
photograph taken by Charles C. Ebbets during construction of the GE Building at Rockefeller
Center in 1932.



The photograph depicts 11 men eating lunch, seated on a girder with their feet dangling
hundreds of feet above the New York City streets. Ebbets took the photo on September 29, 1932,
and it appeared in the New York Herald Tribune in its Sunday photo supplement on October 2.
Taken on the 69th floor of the GE Building during the last several months of construction, the
photo Resting on a Girder shows the same workers napping on the beam.

Here's a rare image by the same photographer showing the workers sleeping on the crossbeam.

Migrant Mother [1936]

For many, this picture of Florence Owens Thompson (age 32) represents the Great Depression.
She was the mother of 7 and she struggled to survive with her kids catching birds and picking
fruits. Dorothea Lange took the picture after Florence sold her tent to buy food for her
children. She made the first page of major newspapers all over the country and changed
people's conception about migrants.

Omayra SÃƒ¡nchez [1985]

Red Cross rescue workers had apparently repeatedly appealed to the government for a pump to
lower the water level and for other help to free the girl. Finally rescuers gave up and spent
their remaining time with her, comforting her and praying with her. She died of exposure after
about 60 hours.

A vulture watches a starving child [1993]

The prize-winning image: A vulture watches a starving child in southern Sudan, March 1, 1993.

Carter's winning photo shows a heart-breaking scene of a starving child collapsed on the
ground, struggling to get to a food center during a famine in the Sudan in 1993. In the
background, a vulture stalks the emaciated child.



Carter was part of a group of four fearless photojournalists known as the "Bang Bang Club" who
traveled throughout South Africa capturing the atrocities committed during apartheid.



Haunted by the horrific images from Sudan, Carter committed suicide in 1994 soon after
receiving the award.

Biafra [1969]

When the Igbos of eastern Nigeria declared themselves independent in 1967, Nigeria
blockaded their fledgling country-Biafra. In three years of war, more than one million
people died, mainly of hunger. In famine, children who lack protein often get the disease
kwashiorkor, which causes their muscles to waste away and their bellies to protrude. War
photographer Don McCullin drew attention to the tragedy. "I was devastated by the sight of 900
children living in one camp in utter squalor at the point of death," he said. "I lost all
interest in photographing soldiers in action." The world community intervened to help
Biafra, and learned key lessons about dealing with massive hunger exacerbated by war-a
problem that still defies simple solutions.

Misery in Darfur [2004]

It's an image which depicts a depressed, shoulders-down figure of a child in a cluster of what
remains of her family.



The very weather-beaten arm of her mother goes over her left shoulder and there are the very
small weather-beaten hands of the child, who is about five or six, clinging on to this one piece
of security that she has, which is the weather-beaten hand of her mother.



The mother is not in the image, she's in the background. But then slightly further in the
background you see the other hands of her brothers and sisters as they wait in this village.

Tragedy in Oklahoma [1995]

The fireman has taken the time to remove his gloves before receiving this infant from the
policeman.



Anyone who knows anything about firefighters know that their gloves are very rough and
abrasive and to remove these is like saying I want to make sure that I am as gentle and as
compassionate as I can be with this infant that I don't know is dead or alive.



The fireman is just cradling this infant with the utmost compassion and caring.



He is looking down at her with this longing, almost to say with his eyes: "It's going to be OK, if
there's anything I can do I want to try to help you."



He doesn't know that she has already passed away.

How Life Begins [1965]

In 1957 he began taking pictures with an endoscope, an instrument that can see inside a body
cavity, but when Lennart Nilsson presented the rewards of his work to LIFE's editors several
years later, they demanded that witnesses confirm that they were seeing what they thought
they were seeing. Finally convinced, they published a cover story in 1965 that went on for 16
pages, and it created a sensation. Then, and over the intervening years, Nilsson's
painstakingly made pictures informed how humanity feels about . . . well, humanity. They also
were appropriated for purposes that Nilsson never intended. Nearly as soon as the 1965
portfolio appeared in LIFE, images from it were enlarged by right-to-life activists and
pasted to placards.

First Flight [1903]

December 17, 1903 was the day humanity spread its wings and rose above the ground - for 12
seconds at first and by the end of the day for almost a minute - but it was a major breakthrough.
Orville and Wilbur Wright, two bicycle mechanics from Ohio, are the pioneers of aviations,
and although this first flight occurred so late in history, the ulterior development was
exponential.

Earthrise [1968]

The late adventure photographer Galen Rowell called it "the most influential environmental
photograph ever taken." Captured on Christmas Eve, 1968, near the end of one of the most
tumultuous years the U.S. had ever known, the Earthrise photograph inspired contemplation
of our fragile existence and our place in the cosmos. For years, Frank Borman and Bill Anders of
the Apollo 8 mission each thought that he was the one who took the picture. An investigation of
two rolls of film seemed to prove Borman had taken an earlier, black-and-white frame, and the
iconic color photograph, which later graced a U.S. postage stamp and several book covers, was
by Anders.
