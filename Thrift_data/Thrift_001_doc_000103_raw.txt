Cosmogony in Sound: Iannis Xenakis’ “The Legend of Er”



Image: http://i43.tinypic.com/nf3zgy.gif



Released on DVD by Mode Records (2005)

The Pompidou Center in Paris: a monument to modernism erected at the historical moment of that
movement’s decline. Â It was here, at the inauguration of the Pompidou in 1978, that the
composer and architect Iannis Xenakis presented his “gesture of light and sound” known
as Le Diatope .Â

Made of red vinyl stretched over a metal frame, the Diatope’s curvilinear form recalls the
famous Philips Pavilion designed by Xenakis and Le Corbusier for the Brussels World Fair in
1958, which housed theÂ  PoÃšme Ã©lectronique Â of EdgardÂ VarÃšse .
Â Indeed, the immersive multimedia plan of the Philips Pavilion was the model for a number
of later works Xenakis called Polytopes. Â  He created four of these prior to the Diatope:
the Polytope de Montreal Â in 1967, an open-air spectacle in Persepolis in 1971, and two
Polytopes in the Parisian Abby of Cluny in 1972 and 1973.

Inside the Diatope Xenakis arranged a light show involving 1600 flashbulbs and four lasers
guided by four hundred adjustable mirrors. Â Both abstract and representational figures
were meticulously choreographed and traced by light. Xenakis’ sketches for the light show
mention shapes such as “lotuses,”galaxies,” and “wheels.”

In the program booklet for the original 1977 presentation, Xenakis included five quotations
that together capture the metaphysical ambiance of the work. Â I reproduce them here in the
order in which they originally appeared:

Each group would spend seven days in open country, and on the eighth, they had to break camp and
head out for four days to finally reach a place where one discovers, stretching all across the
sky and over the earth, a beam of light straight as a pillar, akin to a rainbow, but much more
radiant and pure. â€“ Plato, The Republic

From there emerged a crying out, indistinct, one I likened to a voice of fire, Â  just as there
emerged from the lightâ€Ša holy Word blanketing all of Nature, and the purest of fire was
thrust out of the humid natural world toward the sublime area above. â€“ Hermes
Trismegistus , Pymander

For indeed, what is man within nature? Â  A void in the face of infinity, a whole before the
void, a center between nothingness and wholenessâ€Šunable to perceive the void from
whence he came, nor the infinity in which he is submerged. â€“ Blaise Pascal, Pens Ã© es

Â  Christ went on: “I traversed the worlds, I ascended into the suns, and soared with the
Milky Ways through the wastes of heaven; but there is no God. I descended to the last reaches of
the shadows of Being, and I looked into the chasm and cried: ‘Father, where art thou?’ But I
heard only the eternal storm ruled by none, and the shimmering rainbow of essence stood
without sun to create it, trickling above the abyss. â€“ Jean-Paul Richter , Siebenk
Ã€s

In the first stages of the explosion, the general distribution of the starâ€™s energy
closely matches the distribution known for theoretical black holes at a temperature of
12,000 degrees Kelvin. Â  In the case of SN 1970g the radius was measured at 3x10 14 
centimeters, in other words, as large as the orbit of Uranus. Â  Once the
supernovaâ€™s radius is known, it is possible to determine its absolute luminosity.
Â  For SN 1970g, this was calculated at 10 42  ergs per second, or one trillion times that of
the sunâ€Š Â  During the 30 days following the explosion, the radius of the surface from
which the light was emitted increases at a near-constant speed of 5,000 kilometers per
second. Â  At the end of this period, the starâ€™s photosphere, in other words, its
visible surface, reaches a radius of 2x10 18 centimeters, a much larger radius than that of our
solar system. â€“ Robert P. Kirshner, Supernova

These quotations offer no program or story, but rather, at best, set a mood for the spectacle: a
sort of saturnine melancholy tinged with childlike wonder. Â The first quote, taken from
the end of Plato’s Republic , demands explanation, as it the source of the title Xenakis
chose for the musical component of the Diatope. Â It concerns a soldier named Er who returns
from the dead and describes what he saw on the other side. Â The vision culminates with
Er’s sighting of the “Spindle of Necessity,” a great shaft encircled with eight rings
representing the eight celestial spheres known to ancient astronomy. Â On each ring is
perched a siren singing a tone corresponding to the circumference of its orbit and together
forming a cosmic harmony. Â Seated on thrones amidst the sirens are the three Fates, or
“daughters of necessity,” who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens:
Lachesis, singing of the past, Clotho of the present, and Atropos of the future.

Finally, there is the music: comprising seven tracks distributed over 11 loudspeakers
placed throughout the Diatope, Xenakis’ tape compositionÂ  La legÃ©nde d’Eer ( The
Legend of Er ) is a sprawling, 46-minute journey in sound. Â (For the DVD release,
Xenakis’ original seven-channel mix has been reduced to a 5.1 version.)

Given Xenakis’ reputation as a composer of fearful complexity, the form of the music is
remarkably transparent: beginning with pure, high twinkling tones that Xenakis described
as “sonic shooting stars,” layer upon layer of sound is added, from harsh, wailing
industrial noises, to recognizable instrumental timbres such as thumb piano and mouth harp,
to a throbbing electronic vortex that emerges midway through the composition. Â These
sound layers enter at lower and lower registers, suggesting a descent from the rarefied upper
realms into the chthonic domain below. Â Hearing this music at high volume over a
surround-sound system in a large room, one is confronted with the sublime aesthetic terror of
sensory overload. Â As one listener described the experience, it is the auditory
equivalent of staring directly into the sun.

Finally the density of sound subsides, and at the end the listener is left once again with the
shooting stars. Â These too gently fade away into a now-resonant silence.Â The
emergence and passing of these distinct sonic textures gives the music a powerful if
extremely dilated sense of motion. Â Indeed, the time scale of The Legend of Er , and the
primal violence of its sounds, are suggestive less of human music than of natural phenomena:
as if we, like Er himself, are here witness to some vast cosmological process otherwise
inaccessible to human ears and eyes.
