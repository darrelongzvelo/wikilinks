Daring idea for safe sex

via youtube.com

Instead of focusing on the dangers of unprotected sex, the Stockholm County AIDS Prevention
Programme distributed 100,000 condoms with an unique number and a URL for people to upload the
stories about how did they use it.

    Another Promo & Activation Gold Lion, this time forÂ Charities, Public Health &
    Safety, Public Awareness Messages. It also won a Promo & Activation Silver Lion
    forÂ Best Integrated Campaign Led by Promotion and Activation.

The first interactive horror movie

via youtube.com

With this digital version of â€˜ Choose your Own Adventure â€™ 13th Street Horror TV
channel engaged its audience at the cinemas.

People who opted for participating at the beginning of the movie would receive a call from the
movie star in danger and he or she would help her to scape, creating a different film each time.

    â€˜Last Callâ€™ just won a Promo & Activation Gold Lion for Best Use of Other
    Digital Media in a Promotional Campaign. Iâ€™ll keep posting more of the latest
    Cannes winners .

Virtually all Cannes Grand Prix use activation



It couldnâ€™t be a better time. Activation is coming of age. I said many times that the
most exciting work in the past few years used some sort of direct consumer engagement like
KitKat Mail, The Best Job in the World or Earth Hour. But this year results are speaking loud and
clear.

Practically all of the Grand Prix winners are activation in nature. And not only the usual
suspects as Promo or Media Lions, but also the least expected categories like Design or even
Press. Letâ€™s take a look:

The 2010 Cannes Promo & Activation Lions Grand Prix

via theinspirationroom.com

All the Promo & Activation Lions winners are now online and Gatorade took the Grand Prix with an
inspired integrated campaign/event.

Since 7 out of 10 adults donâ€™t exercise regularly and, therefore, donâ€™t
consume Gatorade as often as before, they had to reignite their passion for sports. To do so,
they sponsored an event that reunited the â€”now over 30 years oldâ€” players of
two rival American football teams which last legendary match ended up in a tie 17 years ago.

Above is the trailer but better watch the case study at Cannes website.

Also take a look at the Gold winners , Silver winners and Bronze winners .

    Many of them â€”like Auditorium , The Cube , Red Flag Movement , Worldâ€™s
    Biggest Signpost , Teletransporter , $73,000 Bar Tab and Whopper Face â€”
    weâ€™ve covered before.Â Iâ€™ll be writing about the rest of the winners
    soon.

via campaignbrief.com

The North Face â€™ Red Flag Movement â€™ campaign picks the only Silver Lion for
Asia in the Promo & Activation category.

Kudos to a truly multidisciplinary team that made this work possible: Kevin Lee (ECD OMA) who
came up with the core idea, Natalie Lam (ECD OO) who did the digital/online implementation,
and our very own Sean Sim (ECD OA) who put it all together in a comprehensive activation
campaign that brought it to life.

    In case you havenâ€™t seen it, check again the pics and the video . And donâ€™t
    forget to congratulate Sean and his team.

The $73,000 bar bill

via youtube.com

Fresh from the Cannes Promo & Activation Lions shortlist that has just been announced.

Ogilvy Brazil attempted to reduce drunk driving by handing over a $73,000 bar tab when people
asked for their bill.Â The grand total included all the expenses of a potential
hospitalisation. Enough to make you sober instantly.Â 

Will it win?

    UPDATE: It did. PIcked up a Bronze Lion for Promo & Activation.

via clioawards.com

A few weeks ago, Clio Awards announced the 2010 results. Again , hereâ€™s a selection of
the winners which involve some sort of activation or consumer engagement.

Clio has always had plenty of categories for non-traditional communications, therefore no
surprise that there are many more winners than in One Show . Interesting how activation work
can win in more than one category, including Design.

I trimmed the list to feature the Gold winners only but Iâ€™ll be covering the rest in
future posts. Enjoy.

The Treehouse Restaurant [CLASSIC]

via youtube.com

To revamp the relevance of Yellow Pages in a Google world they didnâ€™t just go out there
introducing a new brand look & feel. Instead, they engaged the audience through a convincing
and multi-layered product demo.

After selecting an unknown accordion player out of hundreds of social media applicants, they
commissioned her to build a treehouse restaurant only using the aid of Yellow Pages. The
project was promoted and followed by TV, outdoor and social media again and unpaid media
coverage.

As all classics , it has plenty of success elements: a simple and iconic idea (building a
treehouse), integrated media, beautiful execution (they went the extra mile capturing the
making-of), social media value and outstanding business and awards results.

    In case you missed it, you might also like the Yellow Pages Hidden Pizza case study.

CNNâ€™s red tape



via theinspirationroom.com

A very simple idea executed with depth. That’s what it took to launch the network’s new
tagline ‘Go Beyond Borders’.

Taking advantage of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , CNN put a red tape
throughout Berlin showing the former position of the border. The artist called El Bocho
(slang for ‘someone very clever’) also created graffiti art, installations and posters
with QR codes for people to find out more or share their own stories.

Apart from the 40 km of Go Beyond Border tape and the art on ground, the campaign used a Flickr
photostream , a YouTube channel and Google Maps to create a social web of history and stories.
