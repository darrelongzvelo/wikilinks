When was Rockefeller Plaza named?

I am trying to narrow down the publication date of several books published by Caxton House,
Inc., Rockefeller Plaza, NY NY, and there is no copyright or print date listed, so book
condition and the publisher address are the best I have to go on.



Thanks,

Answer from KingofRandomCrap

1931



Rockefeller Center was named after John D. Rockefeller Jr. ("Junior"), who leased the space
from Columbia University in 1928 and developed it between 1929 and 1940. Rockefeller
initially planned to build an opera house for the Metropolitan Opera Company on the site, but
changed his mind after the stock market crash of 1929, and withdrawal of the Metropolitan from
the project. Construction of buildings in the Art Deco style began in 1931. Principal
architect for the complex was Raymond Hood, working with a team that included a young Wallace
Harrison. It was the PR pioneer Ivy Lee, the prominent adviser to the family, who first
suggested the name "Rockefeller Center" for the complex, in 1931. Junior initially didn't
want the Rockefeller family name associated with the commercial project, but was persuaded
on the grounds that the name would attract far more tenants. Sources:

It was named for Rockefeller in 1931

Rockefeller Center was named after John D. Rockefeller Jr. ("Junior"), who leased the space
from Columbia University in 1928 and developed it between 1929 and 1940. Rockefeller
initially planned to build an opera house for the Metropolitan Opera Company on the site, but

family name associated with the commercial project, but was persuaded on the grounds that the

What could have become a major controversy in the mid-1930s concerned the last of the four
European buildings that remained unnamed. Attempts were made by Ivy Lee and others to rent out
the space to German commercial concerns and name it the Deutsches Haus. Junior ruled this out
after being advised of Hitler's Nazi march towards World War II, and thus the empty office site
became the International Building North.[2]



This subsequently became the primary location of the US operations of British Intelligence
(MI6) during the War, with Room 3603 becoming the principal operations center for US
intelligence, organised by William Joseph Donovan, as well as the office of the future head of
what was later to become the Central Intelligence Agency, Allen Dulles.[3] Sources:

Rockefeller Center was named after John D. Rockefeller Jr. ("Junior"), 1928





Rockefeller Center



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Plaza at Rockefeller Center.

Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 commercial buildings covering 22 acres between 48th and
51st Streets in New York . It is located in the center of Midtown Manhattan , spanning between
Fifth Avenue and Seventh Avenue . It is the largest privately held complex of its kind in the
world, and an international symbol of commerce and capitalism. Rockefeller Center is a
combination of two building complexes: the older Art Deco office buildings from the 1930s,
and a set of four International-style towers built along the Avenue of the Americas during the
1960s and 1970s. (The Time-Life Building and the News Corporation / Fox News Channel
headquarters are part of the "newer" Rockefeller Center buildings.)

The entire Rockefeller Center complex was purchased by Mitsubishi Estate , a real estate
company of the Mitsubishi Group , in 1989. In 2000, Jerry Speyer (a close friend of David
Rockefeller ), of Tishman Speyer Properties, L.P. , together with the Lester Crown family of
Chicago, bought out for $1.85 billion the previous owners: Goldman Sachs (which owned half
the complex), the Giovanni Agnelli family, Stavros Niarchos and David Rockefeller.

Rockefeller Center’s landmark plaque.

Rockefeller Center was named after John D. Rockefeller Jr. ("Junior"), who leased the space
from Columbia University in 1928 and developed it between 1929 and 1940. Rockefeller
initially planned to build an opera house for the Metropolitan Opera Company on the site, but
changed his mind after the stock market crash of 1929 , and withdrawal of the Metropolitan from
the project. Construction of buildings in the Art Deco style began in 1931. Principal
architect for the complex was Raymond Hood , working with a team that included a young Wallace
Harrison .

It was the PR pioneer Ivy Lee , the prominent adviser to the family, who first suggested the name
"Rockefeller Center" for the complex, in 1931. Junior initially didn’t want the
Rockefeller family name associated with the commercial project, but was persuaded on the
grounds that the name would attract far more tenants. [1]

What could have become a major controversy in the mid-1930s concerned the last of the four
European buildings that remained unnamed. Attempts were made by Ivy Lee and others to rent out
the space to German commercial concerns and name it the Deutsches Haus. Junior ruled this out
after being advised of Hitler ’s Nazi march towards World War II , and thus the empty office
site became the International Building North . [2]

This subsequently became the primary location of the US operations of British Intelligence (
MI6 ) during the War, with Room 3603 becoming the principal operations center for US
intelligence, organised by William Joseph Donovan , as well as the office of the future head of
what was later to become the Central Intelligence Agency , Allen Dulles . [3]



[ edit ] Radio City Music Hall



The nation’s largest indoor theater, Radio City Music Hall , is located in the complex. One
of the complex’s first and most important tenants was the Radio Corporation of America ,
hence the original names "Radio City" and "Radio City Music Hall."



[ edit ] The GE Building (RCA Building)



Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/RockCenterRooftopGardens.JPG/250px-RockCenterRooftopGardens.JPG

Image: http://en.wikipedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png Gardens on
the roofs of Rockefeller Plaza buildings.

The centerpiece of Rockefeller Center is the 71-floor, 872-foot (266-m) GE Building at 30
Rockefeller Plaza ("30 Rock") - formerly known as the RCA Building - centered behind the
sunken plaza. The RCA building is the setting for the now famous photograph taken by Charles C.
Ebbets in 1932 of workers lunching on a steel beam without harnesses. The 800 feet drop lies
below. It was renamed in the 1980s after General Electric (GE) re-acquired RCA , which it
helped found in 1919. The skyscraper is the headquarters of NBC and houses most of the
network’s New York studios, including the legendary Studio 8H, home of Saturday Night Live
. NBC currently owns the space it occupies in the building as a condominum arrangement. Unlike
most other Art Deco towers built during the 1930s , the GE Building was constructed as a slab
with a flat roof, where the Center’s observation deck , Top of the Rock, is located. The
famous Rainbow Room club restaurant is located on the 65th floor.

[ edit ] Art



Rockefeller Center represents a turning point in the history of architectural sculpture:
it’s among the last major building projects in the United States to incorporate a program of
integrated public art. Sculptor Lee Lawrie contributed the largest number of individual
pieces, fourteen, including the statue of Atlas facing Fifth Avenue, and the conspicuous
friezes above the main entrance to the RCA Building.

Paul Manship ’s highly recognizable gilded statue of Prometheus recumbent, bringing fire
to mankind, features prominently in a sunken plaza which is used as an ice-skating rink during
winter. The model for Prometheus was Leon Nole. Although some sources cite it as the
fourth-most familiar statue in the United States, behind the Lincoln Memorial , Mount
Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty , Manship was not particularly fond or proud of it.

A large number of other artists contributed work here, including Carl Milles , Hildreth
Meiere , Isamu Noguchi , Margaret Bourke-White , Dean Cornwell , and Leo Friedlander . The
aesthetic quality of this work varies considerably and some of its allegorical content is
enigmatic. Famously the Mexican socialist artist Diego Rivera was commissioned to create a
fresco for the lobby of the RCA Building, but his Man at the Crossroads became controversial
because it contained a portrait of Lenin and John D. Rockefeller Jr ’s wife Abby Greene
Aldrich gambling like a socialite that she was. It was removed from the building at the
instigation of Nelson Rockefeller . Rivera re-created the work later in Mexico City in
modified form. His fresco was replaced by a mural by the artist Jose Maria Sert depicting
giants hurling tree trunks at each other.

eye view of Rockefeller Plaza, the heart of Rockefeller Center.

At street level, the plaza has about 200 flagpoles. At varying intervals, the flags of United
Nations member countries , the flags of United States states and territories , or various
decorative and seasonal flags are flown; during U.S. holidays, every flagpole carries the
Stars and Stripes .

Just to clarify, my question is not about the name "Rockefeller Center," but about when the
name "Rockefeller Plaza" came into use.

Thanks.
