The Story of NBA logo

Posted on April 27, 2011 by ginutza.com Reply

It was 1969. The National Basketball Association was locked in a bitter battle against its
upstart rival, the Am erican Basketball Association . At stake: fans, players,
mediaâ€”and millions of dollars.

The NBA turned to Alan Siegel, founder of Siegel+Gale .

Seeking inspiration, Siegel poured through the photo archives of Sport magazine. A
particular photo of the All-Star Jerry West grabbed his attention: It was dynamic, it was
vertical, it captured the essence of the game.

The NBA is reluctant to acknowledge that itâ€™s Jerry West in the logo, and Siegel, a
lifelong basketball fan, believes he knows why.

â€œThey want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. Itâ€™s become
such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing
program that they donâ€™t necessarily want to identify it with one player.â€�

NBA Commissioner David Stern, through a spokesman, declines to comment, saying he
doesnâ€™t know whether West is on the logo.

â€œThereâ€™s no record of it here,â€� spokesman Tim Frank says.

Today, this classic image generates $3 billion a year in licensing, and the NBA name
symbolizes the pinnacle of excellence in professional basketball. Posted in Articles |

How to Paint a Story Book Character in Adobe Photoshop

Posted on February 22, 2011 by ginutza.com Reply



In this tutorial I will be using Adobe Photoshop and a Wacom TabletÂ  to create the finished
2d painting. You can use Corel Painter if you want. I will also be using techniques and methods
that I feel most comfortable with when coloring. I suggest that after following this
tutorial, you find out what works best for you .

http://artisanart.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Kaitlin_and_the-Butterfly2.jpg

Step 1: The conceptÂ  is about a little cartoon girl character who is surprisedÂ  by a
green butterfly.Â  While walking on the park I saw a very cute little girl who is looking to a
butterfly and smile to it.Â  She was looking so cute and innocentÂ  with that colorful
butterfly and a handful flowers on her little hands.Â  She was really reallyÂ  so
cuteÂ  so I decide to make a painting work about her and her little friend.Â  When I went
home I start this illustration. I will make this illustration for some story books or some
cards.Â  They can use this cute girl in a story book Iâ€™m sure. I will start from a rough
sketchÂ  and take the sketch for further color illustration.Â  This character painting
tutorial is basically for tablet users. if you donâ€™t have oneÂ Â  either it will
take you 10 times longer. You must have a Tablet for to get a good result like I did.Â  I always
start off with a sketch for my concept work.Â  The background and the sketch both have their
own layers.

Step 2: As a start I used around about a 1000×1378Â  pixel canvas.Â  And furthermore, I
work on a very wide format so that I can work on details. Create a wide high DPI resolution image,
like you see on this one.

Step 3: Now Iâ€™ll fill my document with something different than white . White color is
too bright and not good for starting. Â #867e71 is Â good for now.
