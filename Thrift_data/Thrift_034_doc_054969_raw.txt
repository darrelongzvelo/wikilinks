Сталин; Georgian : იოსებ სტალინი, born as Iosef
Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili , December 18 , 1878 – March 5 , 1953 ) was General Secretary of
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 's Central Committee from 1922 until his death in 1953.
During that time he established the regime now known as Stalinism . As one of several Central
Committee Secretariats, Stalin's formal position was originally limited in scope, but he
gradually consolidated power and became the de facto party leader and dictator [2] of the
Soviet Union .

Stalin launched a command economy in the Soviet Union, and forced rapid industrialization of
the largely rural country and collectivization of its agriculture by confiscating the lands
of farmers. He derogatorily referred to farmers as " kulaks "; millions were killed, exiled to
Siberia , or died of starvation after their land, homes, meager possessions, and ability to
earn an existence from the land were taken to fulfill Stalin's vision of massive " factory
farms ". While the Soviet Union transformed from an agrarian economy to a major industrial
powerhouse in a short span of time, millions of people died from hardships and famine that
occurred as a result of the severe economic upheaval and party policies. At the end of 1930s,
Stalin launched the Great Purge , a major campaign of political repression . During his
continued repressions, millions of people who were a threat to the Soviet politics or
suspected of being such a threat were executed or exiled to Gulag labor camps in remote areas of
Siberia or Central Asia , where many more died of disease, malnutrition and exposure. A number
of ethnic groups in Russia were forcibly resettled for political reasons.

During Stalin's rule, the Soviet Union played a major role in the defeat of Nazi Germany in the
Second World War (1939–1945). Some historians believe Stalin contributed to starting
World War II because of his secret agreement with Nazi Germany to carve up the nation of Poland ,
as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939. This led to the Soviet Union's invasion of
Poland from the east later that same year, following Nazi Germany's invasion of western
Poland.

Under Stalin's leadership after the war, the Soviet Union went on to achieve recognition as
one of just two superpowers in the world. That status lasted for nearly four decades after his
death until the dissolution of the Soviet Union . __________________

Born Iosef Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili ( Georgian : იოსებ
ბესარიონის ძე ჯუღაშვილი, Iosef Besarionis
Dze Jughashvili ; Russian : Ио́сиф Виссарио́нович
Джугашви́ли ? · i , Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili ) ( December 18 [ O.S.
December 6] 1878 [1] – March 5 , 1953 ), better known by his assumed name, Josef Stalin
(Иосиф Сталин, Iosif Stalin ; stalin meaning "made of steel" [3] ) became General
Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party in 1922. Following the death of Vladimir Lenin in
1924, Stalin prevailed in a power struggle over Leon Trotsky , who was expelled from the
Communist Party and deported from the Soviet Union.

In the 1930s Stalin initiated a Purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , which has
become known as the Great Purge , an unprecedented campaign of political repression,
persecution and executions that reached its peak in 1937. Stalin's rule had long-lasting
effects on the features that characterized the Soviet state from the era of his rule to its
collapse in 1991. Stalin claimed his policies were based on Marxism-Leninism . Now his
political and economic system is referred to as Stalinism . Some Maoists , anti-revisionists
and some others say he was actually the last legitimate Socialist leader in the Soviet Union's
history.

Stalin replaced the New Economic Policy (NEP) of the 1920s with Five-Year Plans in 1928 and
initiated collective farming at roughly the same time. He transformed the Soviet Union from a
predominantly peasant society to a major world industrial power by the end of the 1930s. [5]
[6] [7]

Confiscations of grain and other food by the Soviet authorities under his orders contributed
to a famine between 1932 and 1934, especially in the key agricultural regions of the Soviet
Union, Ukraine ( see Holodomor ), Kazakhstan and North Caucasus , that resulted in millions of
deaths. Many peasants resisted collectivization and grain confiscations, but were
repressed, especially well-off peasants deemed " kulaks ". [8]

Bearing the brunt of the Nazis' attacks (around 75% of the Wehrmacht 's forces), the Soviet
Union under Stalin made the largest and most decisive contribution to the defeat of Nazi
Germany during World War II (known in the USSR as the Great Patriotic War , 1941–1945). After
the war, Stalin established the USSR as one of the two major superpowers in the world, a
position it maintained for nearly four decades following his death in 1953.

Stalin's rule, reinforced by a cult of personality , fought real and alleged opponents mainly
through the security apparatus, such as the NKVD . Millions of people were killed through
famines , executions, deportations , and in the Gulag . In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev , Stalin's
eventual successor, first denounced Stalin's rule and the cult of personality, thus
initiating the process of " de-Stalinization " which later contributed to the Sino-Soviet
Split .

Stalin's birth house in Gori , Georgia





Joseph Stalin was born Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili in Gori , Georgia to Vissarion and
Ekaterina Dzhugashvili . Stalin's mother was born a serf . His father was a cobbler and owned
his own workshop. He was their third child; their two previous sons died in infancy. The second
and third toes of his left foot were webbed. [9] [10]

Initially, the Dzhugashvilis' lives were prosperous and happy, but Stalin's father became
an alcoholic [11] , which gradually led to his business failing and his becoming violently
abusive to his wife and child. As their financial situation grew worse, Stalin's family moved
homes frequently; at least nine times in Stalin's first ten years of life. [12]

The town where Stalin grew up was a violent and lawless place. It had only a small police force
and a culture of violence that included gang-warfare, organized street brawls and wrestling
tournaments (some of these were traditions inherited from Georgia's war-torn past). [12]
Stalin took part in streetfighting as a child; he was not afraid to challenge opponents who
were much stronger than he, and he was severely beaten on numerous occasions. [12]

At the age of 7, Stalin fell ill with smallpox and his face was badly scarred by the disease. He
later had photographs retouched to make his pockmarks less apparent. Stalin's native tongue
was Georgian. He started learning Russian only when he was eight or nine years old, and he never
lost his strong Georgian accent.

At the age of 10, Stalin began his education at the Gori Church School. His peers were mostly the
sons of affluent priests, officials, and merchants. He and most of his classmates at Gori were
Georgians and spoke mostly Georgian . However, at school they were forced to speak Russian
(this was the policy of Tsar Alexander III ). Their Russian teachers mocked the accents of
their Georgian students, and regarded their language and culture as inferior.
Nevertheless, Stalin earned the respect and admiration of his teachers by being the best
student in the class, earning top marks across the board. He developed a passion for learning
that stayed with him for the rest of his life. He became a very good choir singer and was often
hired to sing at weddings. He also began to write poetry, something he would develop in later
years. [12]

Stalin's father, who had always wanted the boy to be trained as a cobbler rather than be
educated, was infuriated when he was accepted into the school. In his anger he smashed the
windows of the local tavern, and later attacked the town police chief. Out of compassion for
Stalin's mother, the police chief did not arrest him, but ordered Vissarion to leave town. He
moved to Tiflis where he found work in a shoe factory and left his family behind in Gori. [12]

About the time Stalin began school, he was struck by a horse-drawn carriage. The accident
permanently damaged his left arm; this injury would later exempt him from military service in
World War I. At the age of 12, Stalin was struck again by a horse-drawn carriage and injured
badly. He was taken to hospital in Tiflis where he spent months in care. After he recovered, his
father seized the opportunity to kidnap the boy and enroll him as an apprentice cobbler at the
shoe factory where he worked. When his mother, through the aid of contacts in the clergy and
school staff, recovered the boy, his father cut off all financial support to his wife and son,
leaving them to fend for themselves. Stalin returned to his school in Gori where he continued
to excel. [12]

Young Stalin, circa 1894 (age 16).





He graduated first in his class and in 1894, at the age of 16, he enrolled at the Georgian
Orthodox Seminary of Tiflis , to which he had been awarded a scholarship. The teachers at
Tiflis Seminary were also determined to impose Russian language and culture on the Georgian
students. [12] Like many of his comrades, young Stalin reacted by being drawn to Georgian
patriotism. During this time he gained fame as a poet; his poems were published in several
local newspapers. However, his interest for poetry began to fade as he was drawn to rebellion
and revolution.

During his time at the seminary, Stalin and numerous other students read forbidden
literature that included Victor Hugo novels and revolutionary (including Marxist)
literature. He was caught and punished numerous times for this. One teacher in particular -
Father Abashidze, whom Stalin nicknamed "the Black Spot" - harassed the rebel students
through student informers, nightly patrols and surprise dormitory raids. This personal
experience of "surveillance, spying, invasion of inner life, violation of feelings", in
Stalin's own words, influenced the design of his future terror state. [12] He became an
atheist in his first year. [12] He insisted his peers call him "Koba", after the Robin
Hood-like protagonist of the novel The Patricide by Alexander Kazbegi; he would continue to
use this pseudonym as a revolutionary. In August 1898, he joined the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party (from which the Bolsheviks would later form).

Shortly before the final exams, the Seminary abruptly raised school fees. Unable to pay,
Stalin quit the seminary in 1899 and missed his exams, for which he was officially expelled.
[12] Twenty of his fellow-classmates were expelled for revolutionary activities in 1899,
and forty more were expelled in 1901. [13] Shortly after leaving school, Stalin discovered

Image: ./images/reputation/reputation_pos.gif Early years as a Marxist revolutionary,
1899–1917



After abandoning his priestly education, Stalin took a job as a weatherman at the Tiflis
Meteorological Observatory. Although the pay was relatively low (20 roubles a month), his
workload was light, giving him plenty of time for revolutionary activities. He would
organise strikes, lead demonstrations and give speeches. He soon caught the attention of the
Tsar's secret police, the Okhrana . During this time he met and charmed Simon Ter-Petrossian ,
a violent psychopath [14] who became his long-time henchman and enforcer.

Stalin in 1902.





On the night of April 3 1901 the Okhrana arrested a number of SD Party leaders in Tiflis , but
Stalin spotted their agents waiting in ambush at the Observatory and avoided capture. He went
underground, becoming a full-time revolutionary, living off donations from friends,
sympathizers and his Party. He began writing revolutionary articles for the Baku -based
radical newspaper Brdzola ("Struggle"). [12]

In October, Stalin fled to Batumi and got work at an oil refinery owned by the Rothschild family
. Organizing the workers there, Stalin was almost certainly involved in a 1902 fire at the
refinery designed to trick the management into giving the workers a bonus for putting out the
fire. However, the manager suspected arson and refused to pay. This led to a series of strikes,
all organized by Stalin, which in turn led to arrests and clashes with the Cossacks in the
streets. In one attempt to break their comrades out of prison, thirteen strikers were killed
when Cossacks intervened. Stalin distributed incendiary pamphlets portraying the dead as
martyrs. On April 18 1902, the authorities finally arrested Stalin at one of his secret
meetings. At his trial, Stalin was acquitted of leading the riots due to lack of evidence, but
was kept in custody whilst the authorities investigated his activities in Tiflis. In 1903,
the authorities decided to exile Stalin to Siberia for three years. [12]

Stalin ended up in the Siberian town of Novaya Uda on December 9 1903. During this time, he heard
that two rival factions within the Social-Democrats had formed: the Bolsheviks under Lenin
and the Mensheviks under Julius Martov . Stalin, already an admirer, decided to become a
Leninist. Stalin managed to obtain false papers and, on January 17 1904, escaped Siberia by
train, arriving back in Tiflis ten days later. [12]

With no income, Stalin lived off his circle of friends. One of them introduced him to Lev
Kamenev (then known as Lev Rosenfeld), his future co-ruler of the USSR after Lenin's death. At
this time, Stalin favored a Georgian Social-Democratic party, which caused a rift with the
majority who favored international Marxism. Threatened with expulsion, he was forced to
write Credo , a paper renouncing his views (because this paper distanced himself from Lenin,
when Stalin became ruler of the USSR, he tried to destroy all copies of this Credo , and many of
those who had read it were shot). [12]

In February 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out between Japan and Russia. The war, which
would eventually end in Russia's defeat, severely strained the Russian economy and caused a
great deal of restlessness in Georgia. Stalin travelled across Georgia conducting
political activity for his party. He also worked to undermine the Mensheviks through a
campaign of slander and intrigue; his efforts brought him to Lenin's attention for the first
time.

On January 22 1905, Stalin was in Baku when Cossacks attacked a mass demonstration of workers,
killing two hundred. This sparked off the Russian Revolution of 1905 . Riots, peasant
uprisings and ethnic massacres swept the Russian Empire. In February, ethnic Azeris and
Armenians were slaughtering each other in the streets of Baku. Commanding a squad of armed
Bolsheviks, Stalin ran protection rackets to raise Party funds and stole printing
equipment. Afterwards, he headed west, where continued to campaign against the Mensheviks,
who enjoyed overwhelming support in Georgia. In the mining town of Chiatura , both Stalin and
the Mensheviks competed for the support of the miners; they chose Stalin, being more swayed by
his plain and concise manner of speaking than the flamboyant oratory of the Menshevik
speaker. [12] From Chiatura, Stalin organized and armed Bolshevik militias across Georgia.
With them, he ran protection rackets among the wealthy and waged guerilla warfare on
Cossacks, policemen and the Okhrana. [12] Later that year in Tiflis, he met Ekaterina
Svanidze , who would become his first wife.

In December 1905, Stalin and two other were elected to represent the Caucusus at the next
Bolshevik conference, which took place in Tammerfors , Finland . There, on January 7 1906,
Stalin met Lenin in person for the first time. Although Stalin was impressed by Lenin's
personality and intellect, he was not afraid to contradict him. [12] He objected to Lenin's
proposal that they take part in elections to the recently-formed Duma ; Lenin conceded to
Stalin. At the conference he also met Emelian Yaroslavsky , his future propaganda chief, and
Solomon Lozovsky , his future Deputy Foreign Commissar.

After the conference, Stalin returned to Georgia, where Cossack armies were brutally
working to reconquer the rebellious region for the Tsar. In Tiflis , Stalin and the Mensheviks
plotted the assassination of General Fyodo Griiazanov, which was carried out on March 1 1906.
Stalin continued to raise money for the Bolsheviks through extortion, bank robberies and
hold-ups.

In April 1906, Stalin attended the Fourth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour
Party . At the conference, he met Klimenti Voroshilov, his future Defence Commissar and First
Marshal; Felix Dzerzhinsky , future founder of the Cheka ; and Grigory Zinoviev , with whom he
would share power after Lenin's death. The Congress - in which the Bolsheviks were
outnumbered - voted to ban bank robberies. This upset Lenin, who needed the bank robberies to
raise money. [12]

Stalin married Ekaterina Svanidze on the night of July 28 1906. On March 31 1907, she gave birth
to Stalin's first child, Yakov .

Stalin and Lenin both attended the Fifth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour
Party in London in 1907. [15] This Congress consolidated the supremacy of Lenin's Bolshevik
faction and debated strategy for communist revolution in Russia. Here, Stalin first met Leon
Trotsky in person; Stalin immediately came to hate him, calling him "pretty but useless".
[12] After the conference, Stalin began switching his focus away from Georgia, which was rife
with feuding and dominated by the Mensheviks, to Russia; he began writing in Russian.

Upon his return to Tiflis , Stalin readied himself for a major bank robbery. Through contacts
in the banking business, he had learned a major shipment of money was due to be delivered in June
to the Imperial Bank at the centre of town. Because his party banned bank robberies, Stalin
temporarily resigned. On June 26 1907, Stalin's gang ambushed the armed convoy when it
entered Yerevan Square with gunfire and homemade bombs. Around forty people were killed, but
all of Stalin's gang managed to escape alive with 250,000 roubles (around US$3.4 million in
today's terms). [12] Stalin and his family left Tiflis two days later. His henchman Kamo
delivered the money to Lenin in Finland , who then fled with it to Geneva . The Mensheviks, who
had banned bank robberies (and didn't get to share in the loot), were outraged and
investigated the suspects. Stalin escaped expulsion, though the affair would cause him
trouble for years to come.

Stalin's family moved to Baku . Whilst Stalin continued his revolutionary activities, his
wife fell ill from Baku's pollution, heat, stress and malnourishment. She eventually
contracted typhus (though many historians believe it to have been tuberculosis ) and died on
December 5 1907. Stalin was overcome with grief and retreated into mourning for several
months. The loss also hardened him; he told a friend: "with her died my last warm feelings for
humanity". [12] He abandoned his son, Yakov, who was raised by his deceased wife's family.

When Stalin resumed his activities, he organized more strikes and agitation, this time
focusing on the Muslim Azeri and Persian workers in Baku . He helped found a Muslim Bolshevik
group called Himmat, and also supported Persian Constitutional Revolution with manpower
and weapons, and even visited Persia to organize partisans. Stalin ordered the murders of
many Black Hundreds (right-wing supporters of the Tsar), and conducted protection rackets
and ransom kidnappings against the oil tycoons of Baku . He also operated counterfeiting
operations, robberies and protection rackets. He befriend the criminal gangs, and used them
to obstruct Mensheviks. Stalin's gangsterism upset the Bolshevik intelligentsia, but he
was too influential and indsipensable to oppose. [12]

The Okhrana tracked down and arrested Stalin on April 7 1908. After seven months in prison, he
was sentenced to two years exile in Siberia. He arrived in the village of Solvychegodsk in
early March 1909. After seven months in exile, he disguised himself as a woman and escaped on a
train to St Petersburg. He returned to Baku in late July. [12]

The Bolsheviks were on the verge of collapse due to Okhrana oppression within the Empire and
infighting among the intelligentsia abroad. In desperation, he advocated a reconciliation
with the Mensheviks (which Lenin opposed). He demanded the creation of a Russian Bureau to run
the Social-Democratic Party from within the Empire, to which he was appointed.

Stalin soon realised the Bolsheviks had been heavily infiltrated by Tsarist spies. He
initiated a witch-hunt for traitors. However, he failed to root out any real traitors (as
revealed by Okhrana records [12] ), and his efforts caused much disarray in the Party.

On April 5 1910 Stalin was yet again arrested by the Okhrana . He was banned from the Caucasus for
five years and sentenced to complete his previous exile in Solvychegodsk . He was deported
back there in September. He briefly escaped in early 1911, but another exile who was supposed
to pass much-needed money to him instead ran off with it (Stalin would have him shot for this in
1937), and he was forced to return to Solvychegodsk . During his exile, he fell in love with a
local girl, Maria Kuzakova, with whom he fathered a child. He was released on July 9 1911.
Stalin moved to Vologda in late July, where he had been ordered to reside for two months.

The information card on Joseph Stalin, from the files of the Tsarist secret police in Saint
Petersburg, 1912.





In January 1912, at the Prague Party Conference , Lenin led his Bolshevik faction out of the
Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, founding the separate Bolshevik Party . Stalin was
coopted as a member of the new Bolshevik Central Committee. When Stalin was informed of this,
he left Vologda in late February.

Stalin moved to Saint Petersburg in April 1912, where he took control of the Bolshevik weekly
newspaper Zvezda . Stalin had been assigned to convert Zvezda into a daily and rename it Pravda
. The first issue was published on May 5.

Shortly afterwards, the Okhrana caught up with him again, and in July 1912 he was exiled again
to Siberia for three years, this time in the small village of Narym . He escaped just
thirty-eight days after arriving; this was his shortest exile. [12] He returned to Saint
Petersburg in September.

Stalin made efforts to reconcile the Bolsheviks with the Mensheviks in hopes of salvaging the
struggling Marxist movement. He published editorials in Pravda advocating
reconciliation, and secretly met with Menshevik leaders on several occasions. This angered
Lenin , who twice summoned Stalin to Kraków to argue policy. On the second visit at the end of
1912, Stalin was removed from his post as editor of Pravda , but was made a leader of the Russian
Bureau of the Bolshevik Party. Lenin also asked Stalin to write an essay laying out the
Bolshevik position on national minorities.

After Kraków , Stalin spent several weeks in Vienna with the Troyanovskys, a wealthy
Bolshevik couple he met with Lenin in Kraków. Whilst there he met for the first time Nikolai
Bukharin , who would become a leading politician in the future Soviet government. They
continued to discuss the issue of nationalities. Stalin completed his essay on the topic,
entitled "Marxism and the National Question", which was published in March 1913 under the
pseudonym "K. Stalin" (this was the first time he used the name "Stalin" in a publishing; he
began using this alias in 1912).

Stalin returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1913. During this time, many Bolsheviks,
including almost the entire Central Committee, had been arrested by the Okhrana, having been
betrayed by Roman Malinovsky , a high-ranking Bolshevik who for years had been an Okhrana spy
and agent provocateur. That month, an article had been published that outed Malinovsky as a
spy, but the Bolsheviks dismissed it as Menshevik libel (ironically, Lenin and Stalin were
his strongest defenders). On March 8 Malinovsky persuaded Stalin to attend a Bolshevik
fundraising ball, which was raided by the Okhrana.

Stalin in exile, 1915.





Stalin was condemned to four years in the remote Siberian province of Turukhansk . He was
eventually joined by Kamenev and several other Bolshevik exiles. He spent six months in the
small hamlet of Kostino on the Yenisei River . After learning that Stalin was planning an
escape (he had received money and supplies from his comrades), the authorities moved him
north to Kureika, a hamlet on the edge of the Arctic Circle. There, he lived the life of a
hunter-gatherer, having learned fishing and hunting from the local Siberian tribesmen.
While there he began a 2-year affair with Lidia Pereprygina, then aged 13, with whom he
fathered two children. The first died in infancy; the second, named Alexander, was born in
April 1917.

In late 1916, Stalin was conscripted into the army. He was taken Krasnoyarsk in February 1917,
but the medical examiner there found him unfit for service due to his damaged left arm (a
childhood injury). He spent his last four months of exile in the village of Achinsk.



Aliases



Among his friends he was sometimes known by his childhood nickname "Soso". During his
education in Tiflis, he picked up the nickname "Koba" from the Robin Hood-like protagonist of
The Patricide , a novel by Alexander Kazbegi; this became his favorite streetname throughout
his revolutionary life. __________________

Image: ./images/reputation/reputation_pos.gif Russian Revolution of 1917



In the wake of the February Revolution of 1917 (the first phase of the Russian Revolution of
1917 ), Stalin was released from exile. On March 25 he returned to Petrograd (Saint
Petersburg) and, together with Lev Kamenev and Matvei Muranov , ousted Vyacheslav Molotov
and Alexander Shlyapnikov as editors of Pravda , the official Bolshevik newspaper, while
Lenin and much of the Bolshevik leadership were still in exile. Stalin and the new editorial
board took a position in favor of supporting Alexander Kerensky 's provisional government
(Molotov and Shlyapnikov had wanted to overthrow it) and went to the extent of declining to
publish Lenin's articles arguing for the provisional government to be overthrown. However,
after Lenin prevailed at the April Party conference, Stalin and the rest of the Pravda staff
came on board with Lenin's view and called for overthrowing the provisional government. At
this April 1917 Party conference, Stalin was elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee with
the third highest total votes in the party.

In mid-July, armed mobs led by Bolshevik militants took to the streets of Petrograd , killing
army officers and bourgeois civilians. They demanded the overthrow of the government, but
neither the Bolshevik leadership nor the Petrograd Soviet were willing to take power, having
been totally surprised by this unplanned revolt. After the disappointed mobs dispersed,
Kerensky's government struck back at the Bolsheviks. Loyalist troops raided Pravda and
surrounded the Bolshevik headquarters. Stalin helped Lenin evade capture and, to avoid a
bloodbath, ordered the besieged Bolsheviks to surrender. [12]

Convinced Lenin would be killed if caught, Stalin smuggled Lenin to Finland. In Lenin's
absence, Stalin assumed leadership of the Bolsheviks. At the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik
party, held secretly in Petrograd , Stalin was chosen to be the chief editor of the Party press
and a member of the Constituent Assembly, and was re-elected to the Central Committee. [12]

In September 1917, Kerensky suspected his newly-appointed Commander-in-Chief, General
Lavr Kornilov , of planning a coup and dismissed him. Believing Kerensky was being controlled
by the Bolsheviks, Kornilov decided to march his army on Petrograd . In desperation, Kerensky
turned to the Petrograd Soviet for help and released the Bolsheviks, who together raised a
small army to defend the capital. In the end, Kerensky convinced Kornilov's army to stand down
and disband without violence. However, the Bolsheviks were now free, rearmed and swelling
with new recruits and under Stalin's firm control, whilst Kerensky had few troops loyal to him
in the capital. Lenin decided the time for a coup had arrived. Kamenev and Zinoniev proposed a
coalition with the Mensheviks, but Stalin and Trotsky backed Lenin's wish for an exclusively
Bolshevik government. Lenin returned to Petrograd in October. On October 29, the Central
Committee voted 10-2 in favor of an insurrection; Kamenev and Zinoniev voted in opposition.
[12]

On the morning of November 6, Kerensky's troops raided Stalin's press headquarters and
smashed his printing presses. Whilst he worked to restore his presses, he missed a Central
Committee meeting where assignments for the coup were being issued. Stalin instead spent the
afternoon briefing Bolshevik delegates and passing communications to and from Lenin , who
was in hiding. [12]

Early the next day, Stalin went to the Smolny Institute from where he, Lenin and the rest of the
Central Committee coordinated the coup. Kerensky left the capital to rally the Imperial
troops at the German front. By November 8, the Winter Palace had been stormed and Kerensky's
Cabinet had been arrested.

After seizing Petrograd, civil war broke out in Russia, pitting Lenin 's Red Army against the
White Army , a loose alliance of anti-Bolshevik forces. Lenin formed a five-member Politburo
which included Stalin and Trotsky . During this time, only Stalin and Trotsky were allowed to
see Lenin without an appointment.

In April 1918, Lenin dispatched Stalin to the city of Tsaritsyn . Situated on the Lower Volga ,
it was a key supply route to the oil and grain of the North Caucasus, and it was in danger of
falling to the White Army . Stalin ordered the executions of any suspected
counter-revolutionaries. Here, he first met and befriended Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon
Budyonny , both of whom would become two of Stalin's key supporters in the military. As the
military situation grew worse, Stalin effectively took control of the Red Army . When Trotsky
had formed the Red Army, he recruited many former Tsarist officers for their expertise, but
Stalin distrusted them and had many of them killed, much to Trotsky's anger. [5]

On his return to Moscow in 1919, Stalin married Nadezhda Alliluyeva , his second wife.

In 1922, with the aid of Lenin and Kamenev, Stalin was appointed General Secretary of the
Central Committee. This post gave him the power to appoint his supporters to key positions
within the government and the Party. It also brought the secret police under his control.

Later, in 1924, Stalin himself created a myth around a so-called "Party Centre" which
"directed" all practical work pertaining to the uprising, consisting of himself, Sverdlov ,
Dzerzhinsky , Uritsky , and Bubnov . No evidence was ever shown for the activity of this
"centre", which would, in any case, have been subordinate to the Military Revolutionary
Council, headed by Trotsky.

Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin , and Mikhail Kalinin meeting in 1919. All three of them were "
Old Bolsheviks "; members of the Bolshevik party before the Russian Revolution of 1917 .





During the Russian Civil War and Polish-Soviet War Stalin was a political commissar in the Red
Army at various fronts . Stalin's first government position was as People's Commissar of
Nationalities Affairs (1917–1923). In that position he traveled to Finland in late 1917,
and promised the socialists there that the RSFSR would aid their revolution . However, this
aid was never given and the revolution in Finland was defeated.

He was also People's Commissar of the Workers and Peasants Inspection (1919–1922), a
member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the republic (1920–1923) and a member of
the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets (from 1917).

Stalin played a decisive role in engineering the 1921 Red Army invasion of Georgia following
which he adopted particularly hardline, centralist policies towards Soviet Georgia , which
included severe repression of all opposition within the local Communist party (e.g., the
Georgian Affair of 1922), not to mention any manifestations of anti-Sovietism (the August
Uprising of 1924). [16] It was in the Georgian affairs that Stalin first began to play his own
hand. [17]



Campaign against the left and right opposition



On April 3 , 1922 , Stalin was made general secretary of the Central Committee of the
All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) , a post that he subsequently built up into the most
powerful in the country. It has been claimed that he initially attempted to decline accepting
the post, but was refused. This position was seen to be a minor one within the party (Stalin was
sometimes referred to as "Comrade Card-Index" by fellow party members) but, when combined
with personal leadership over the Orgburo and with an ally (Kaganovich) heading the
organizational Registration and Distribution Department of the Central Committee ,
actually had potential as a power base as it allowed Stalin to fill the party with his allies.

After Lenin's death in January 1924, Stalin, Kamenev , and Zinoviev together governed the
party, placing themselves ideologically between Trotsky (on the left wing of the party) and
Bukharin (on the right). During this period, Stalin abandoned the traditional Bolshevik
emphasis on international revolution in favor of a policy of building " Socialism in One
Country ", in contrast to Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution .

In the struggle for leadership after Lenin's death one thing was evident; whoever ended up
ruling the party had to demonstrate fealty to the memory of Lenin. Stalin did so by organizing
the late leader's funeral, after which he made a speech professing an undying loyalty to Lenin
that was almost religious in nature.

Stalin's actual relationship with Lenin, which was far more complex than Stalin's speeches
alluded, has been illuminated by a number of sources that were made available after the fall of
the Soviet Union, including some from Lenin's sister. [18] [19]

Stalin first worked to undermine Trotsky, who was sick at the time, possibly by misleading him
about the date of the funeral. Consequently, Trotsky, who was Lenin’s associate
throughout the early days of the Soviet regime, lost considerable political support. Stalin
made great deal of the fact that Trotsky had joined the Bolsheviks just before the revolution,
and publicized Trotsky's pre-revolutionary disagreements with Lenin. Another event that
helped Stalin's rise was the fact that Trotsky came out against publication of Lenin's
Testament in which he pointed out the strengths and weaknesses of Stalin and Trotsky and the
other main players, and suggested that he be succeeded by a small group of people.

Joseph Stalin , cartoon by Nikolai Bukharin





An important feature of Stalin’s rise to power is the way that he manipulated his opponents
and played them off against each other. Stalin formed a " troika " of himself, Zinoviev, and
Kamenev against Trotsky. When Trotsky had been eliminated, Stalin then joined Bukharin and
Rykov against Zinoviev and Kamenev, emphasising their vote against the insurrection in
1917. Zinoviev and Kamenev then turned to Lenin's widow, Krupskaya ; they formed the " United
Opposition " in July 1926.

In 1927 during the 15th Party Congress Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the party and
Kamenev lost his seat on the Central Committee. Stalin soon turned against the " Right
Opposition ", represented by his erstwhile allies, Bukharin and Rykov .

Stalin gained popular appeal from his presentation as a 'man of the people' from the poorer
classes. The Russian people were tired from the world war and the civil war, and Stalin's
policy of concentrating in building "Socialism in One Country" was seen as an optimistic
antidote to war.

Stalin took great advantage of the ban on factionalism which meant that no group could openly
go against the policies of the leader of the party because that meant creation of an
opposition. By 1928 (the first year of the Five-Year Plans ) Stalin was supreme among the
leadership, and the following year Trotsky was exiled because of his opposition. Having also
outmaneuvered Bukharin's Right Opposition and now advocating collectivization and
industrialization, Stalin can be said to have exercised control over the party and the
country.

However, as the popularity of other leaders such as Sergei Kirov and the so-called Ryutin
Affair were to demonstrate, Stalin did not achieve absolute power until the Great Purge of
1936–1938. __________________

Main article: Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies

Stalin vastly increased the scope and power of the state's secret police and intelligence
agencies. Under his guiding hand, Soviet intelligence forces began to set up intelligence
networks in most of the major nations of the world, including Germany (the famous Rote
Kappelle spy ring), Great Britain, France, Japan, and the United States. Stalin saw no
difference between espionage, communist political propaganda actions, and
state-sanctioned violence, and he began to integrate all of these activities within the NKVD
. Stalin made considerable use of the Communist International movement in order to
infiltrate agents and to ensure that foreign Communist parties remained pro-Soviet and
pro-Stalin.

One of the best examples of Stalin's ability to integrate secret police and foreign espionage
came in 1940, when he gave approval to the secret police to have Leon Trotsky assassinated in
Mexico. [20]



Stalin and changes in Soviet society, 1927–1939





Industrialization

A portrait of Stalin.





The Russian Civil War and wartime communism had a devastating effect on the country's
economy. Industrial output in 1922 was 13% of that in 1914. A recovery followed under the New
Economic Policy , which allowed a degree of market flexibility within the context of
socialism.

Under Stalin's direction, this was replaced by a system of centrally ordained "Five-Year
Plans" in the late 1920s. These called for a highly ambitious program of state-guided crash
industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture.

With seed capital unavailable because of international reaction to Communist policies,
little international trade , and virtually no modern infrastructure, Stalin's government
financed industrialization both by restraining consumption on the part of ordinary Soviet
citizens to ensure that capital went for re-investment into industry, and by ruthless
extraction of wealth from the kulaks.

In 1933 workers' real earnings sank to about one-tenth of the 1926 level. Common and political
prisoners in labor camps were forced to do unpaid labor, and communists and Komsomol members
were frequently "mobilized" for various construction projects. The Soviet Union used
foreign experts, e.g. British engineer Stephen Adams, to instruct their workers and improve
their manufacturing processes.

In spite of early breakdowns and failures, the first two Five-Year Plans achieved rapid
industrialization from a very low economic base. While it is generally agreed that the Soviet
Union achieved significant levels of economic growth under Stalin, the precise rate of
growth is disputed. It is not disputed, however, that these gains were accomplished at the
cost of millions of lives.

Official Soviet estimates stated the annual rate of growth at 13.9%; Russian and Western
estimates gave lower figures of 5.8% and even 2.9%. Indeed, one estimate is that Soviet growth
became temporarily much higher after Stalin's death. [6] [7]

According to Robert Lewis the Five-Year Plan substantially helped to modernize the
previously backward Soviet economy. New products were developed, and the scale and
efficiency of existing production greatly increased. Some innovations were based on
indigenous technical developments, others on imported foreign technology. [21]



Collectivization



Main article: Collectivization in the USSR

Stalin's regime moved to force collectivization of agriculture. This was intended to
increase agricultural output from large-scale mechanized farms, to bring the peasantry
under more direct political control, and to make tax collection more efficient.
Collectivization meant drastic social changes, on a scale not seen since the abolition of
serfdom in 1861, and alienation from control of the land and its produce. Collectivization
also meant a drastic drop in living standards for many peasants, and it faced violent reaction
among the peasantry.

In the first years of collectivization it was estimated that industrial production would
rise by 200% and agricultural production by 50% [22] , but these estimates were not met. Stalin
blamed this unanticipated failure on kulaks (rich peasants), who resisted
collectivization. (However, kulaks proper made up only 4% of the peasant population; the
"kulaks" that Stalin targeted included the slightly better-off peasants who took the brunt
of violence from the OGPU and the Komsomol. These peasants were about 60% of the population).
Those officially defined as "kulaks," "kulak helpers," and later "ex-kulaks" were to be
shot, placed into Gulag labor camps , or deported to remote areas of the country, depending on
the charge.

The two-stage progress of collectivization—interrupted for a year by Stalin's famous
editorial, " Dizzy with success " ( Pravda , March 2 , 1930 ), and " Reply to Collective Farm
Comrades " ( Pravda , April 3 , 1930 )—is a prime example of his capacity for tactical
political withdrawal followed by intensification of initial strategies.

Many historians assert that the disruption caused by collectivization was largely
responsible for major famines .

The 1932–1933 famine in Ukraine and the Kuban regions has been termed the Holodomor
(Ukrainian: Голодомор).

Entering Gulag (a leaf from Eufrosinia Kersnovskaya 's notebook)





According to Alan Bullock , "the total Soviet grain crop was no worse than that of 1931 … it was
not a crop failure but the excessive demands of the state, ruthlessly enforced, that cost the
lives of as many as five million Ukrainian peasants." Stalin refused to release large grain
reserves that could have alleviated the famine, while continuing to export grain; he was
convinced that the Ukrainian peasants had hidden grain away, and strictly enforced
draconian new collective-farm theft laws in response. [23] [24]

Other historians hold that it was largely the insufficient harvests of 1931 and 1932 caused by
a variety of natural disasters that resulted in famine, with the successful harvest of 1933
ending the famine. [25]

Famine affected other parts of the USSR. The death toll from famine in the Soviet Union at this
time is estimated at between five and ten million people. The worst crop failure of late
tsarist Russia, in 1892, had caused 375,000 to 400,000 deaths.) [26]

Soviet and other historians have argued that the rapid collectivization of agriculture was
necessary in order to achieve an equally rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union and
ultimately win World War II. This is disputed by other historians; Alec Nove claims that the
Soviet Union industrialized in spite of, rather than because of, its collectivized
agriculture.



Science



Main articles: Science and technology in the Soviet Union , Suppressed research in the Soviet
Union , Lysenkoism Science in the Soviet Union was under strict ideological control by Stalin
and his government, along with art and literature. There was significant progress in
"ideologically safe" domains, owing to the free Soviet education system and state-financed
research. However, in several cases the consequences of ideological pressure were
dramatic—the most notable examples being the " bourgeois pseudosciences " genetics and
cybernetics .

In the late 40's, some areas of physics, especially quantum mechanics but also special and
general relativity, were also criticized on grounds of " idealism ". Soviet physicists, such
as K. V. Nikolskij and D. Blokhintzev, developed a version of the statistical interpretation
of quantum mechanics , which was seen as more adhering to the principles of dialectical
materialism . [27] [28] However, although initially planned, [29] this process did not go as
far as defining an "ideologically correct" version of physics and purging those scientists
who refused to conform to it, because this was recognized as potentially too harmful to the
Soviet nuclear program .

Linguistics was the only area of Soviet academic thought to which Stalin personally and
directly contributed. At the beginning of Stalin's rule, the dominant figure in Soviet
linguistics was Nikolai Yakovlevich Marr , who argued that language is a class construction
and that language structure is determined by the economic structure of society. Stalin, who
had previously written about language policy as People's Commissar for Nationalities, read
a letter by Arnold Chikobava criticizing the theory. He "summoned Chikobava to a dinner that
lasted from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. taking notes diligently." [30] In this way he grasped enough of the
underlying issues to coherently oppose this simplistic Marxist formalism, ending Marr's
ideological dominance over Soviet linguistics. Stalin's principal work discussing
linguistics is a small essay, "Marxism and Linguistic Questions." [31]

Although no great theoretical contributions or insights came from it, neither were there any
apparent errors in Stalin's understanding of linguistics; his influence arguably relieved
Soviet linguistics from the sort of ideologically driven theory that dominated genetics.

Scientific research was hindered by the fact that many scientists were sent to labor camps
(including Lev Landau , later a Nobel Prize winner, who spent a year in prison in 1938–1939)
or executed (e.g. Lev Shubnikov , shot in 1937). They were persecuted for their dissident
views, not for their research. Nevertheless, much progress was made under Stalin in some
areas of science and technology. It laid the ground for the famous achievements of Soviet
science in the 1950s, such as the development of the BESM -1 computer in 1953 and the launching
of Sputnik in 1957.

Indeed, many politicians in the United States expressed a fear, after the " Sputnik crisis ,"
that their country had been eclipsed by the Soviet Union in science and in public education.



Social services



Main article: Soviet democracy

Under the Soviet government people benefited from some social liberalization. Girls were
given an adequate, equal education and women had equal rights in employment, [5] improving
lives for women and families. Stalinist development also contributed to advances in health
care, which significantly increased the lifespan and quality of life of the typical Soviet
citizen. [5] Stalin's policies granted the Soviet people universal access to healthcare and
education, effectively creating the first generation free from the fear of typhus , cholera ,
and malaria . [32] The occurrences of these diseases dropped to record low numbers,
increasing life spans by decades. [32]

Soviet women under Stalin were the first generation of women able to give birth in the safety of
a hospital, with access to prenatal care. [32] Education was also an example of an increase in
standard of living after economic development. The generation born during Stalin's rule was
the first near-universally literate generation. Millions benefitted from mass literacy
campaigns in the 1930s, and from workers training schemes. [33] Engineers were sent abroad to
learn industrial technology, and hundreds of foreign engineers were brought to Russia on
contract. [32] Transport links were improved and many new railways built. Workers who
exceeded their quotas, Stakhanovites , received many incentives for their work; [33] they
could afford to buy the goods that were mass-produced by the rapidly expanding Soviet
economy.

The increase in demand due to industrialization and the decrease in the workforce due to World
War II and repressions generated a major expansion in job opportunities for the survivors,
especially for women. [33]



Culture



Main article: Socialist Realism

Stalin propaganda poster, reading: "Beloved Stalin—a fortune of the nation!"





Although born in Georgia, Stalin became a Russian nationalist and significantly promoted
Russian history, language, and Russian national heroes, particularly during the 1930s and
1940s. He held the Russians up as the elder brothers of the non-Russian minorities. [34]

During Stalin's reign the official and long-lived style of Socialist Realism was
established for painting, sculpture, music, drama and literature. Previously fashionable
"revolutionary" expressionism , abstract art , and avant-garde experimentation were
discouraged or denounced as " formalism ". Careers were made and broken, some more than once.
Famous figures were repressed, and many persecuted, tortured and executed, both
"revolutionaries" (among them Isaac Babel , Vsevolod Meyerhold ) and "non-conformists"
(for example, Osip Mandelstam ).

A minority, both representing the "Soviet man" (e.g. Arkady Gaidar ) and remnants of the older
pre-revolutionary Russia (e.g. Konstantin Stanislavski ), thrived. A number of émigrés
returned to the Soviet Union, among them Alexei Tolstoi in 1925, Alexander Kuprin in 1936, and
Alexander Vertinsky in 1943.

Poet Anna Akhmatova was subjected to several cycles of suppression and rehabilitation, but
was never herself arrested. Her first husband, poet Nikolai Gumilev , was shot in 1921, and her
son, historian Lev Gumilev , spent two decades in a gulag .

The degree of Stalin's personal involvement in general, and in specific instances, has been
the subject of discussion. His name was as constantly invoked during his reign in discussions
of culture as in just about everything else; in several famous cases his opinion was final.

Stalin's occasional beneficence showed itself in strange ways. For example, Mikhail
Bulgakov was driven to poverty and despair; yet, after a personal appeal to Stalin, he was
allowed to continue working. His play, The Days of the Turbines , with its sympathetic
treatment of an anti-Bolshevik family caught up in the Civil War, was finally staged,
apparently also on Stalin's intervention, and began a decades-long uninterrupted run at the
Moscow Arts Theater.

Some insights into Stalin's political and esthetic thinking might perhaps be gleaned by
reading his favorite novel, Pharaoh , by the Polish writer Bolesław Prus , a historical novel
on mechanisms of political power. Similarities have been pointed out between this novel and
Sergei Eisenstein 's film, Ivan the Terrible , produced under Stalin's tutelage.

In architecture , a Stalinist Empire Style (basically, updated neoclassicism on a very large
scale, exemplified by the Seven Sisters of Moscow) replaced the constructivism of the 1920s.

Stalin's rule had a largely disruptive effect on the many indigenous cultures within the
Soviet Union. The politics of the Korenization and forced development of "Cultures National
by Form, Socialist by their substance" was arguably beneficial to later generations of
indigenous cultures in allowing them to integrate more easily into Russian society.

The attempted unification of cultures in Stalin's later period was very harmful. Political
repressions and purges were even more devastating to indigenous cultures than on urban ones
as the cultural elites were smaller. The traditional lives of many peoples in the Siberian,
Central Asian and Caucasian provinces was upset and large populations were displaced and
scattered in order to prevent nationalist uprisings.

The Hotel Moskva (Moscow) in Moscow was said to have been built with mismatched side wings
because Stalin had mistakenly signed off both of the proposals submitted, and the architects
had been too afraid to clarify the matter. (The hotel had actually been built by two
independent teams of architects with differing ideas.)

A caricature of "Stalin a great friend of religion", when churches were allowed to be opened
during World War II.





Stalin's role in the fortunes of the Russian Orthodox Church is complex. Continuous
persecution in the 1930s resulted in its near-extinction: by 1939, active parishes numbered
in the low hundreds (down from 54,000 in 1917), many churches had been leveled, and tens of
thousands of priests, monks and nuns were persecuted and killed. Over 100,000 were shot
during the purges of 1937–1938. [35] [36] During World War II , the Church was allowed a
revival as a patriotic organization, after the NKVD had recruited the new metropolitan , the
first after the revolution, as a secret agent. Thousands of parishes were reactivated until a
further round of suppression in Khrushchev's time.

The Russian Orthodox Church Synod's recognition of the Soviet government and of Stalin
personally led to a schism with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia . An Act of
Canonical Communion was signed on May 17 , 2007 , followed immediately by a full restoration of
communion with the Moscow Patriarchate; there remain some issues not fully healed to the
present day.

Just days before Stalin's death, certain religious sects were outlawed and persecuted .

Many religions popular in the ethnic regions of the Soviet Union including the Roman Catholic
Church, Uniats , Baptists, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, etc. underwent ordeals similar to the
Orthodox churches in other parts: thousands of monks were persecuted, and hundreds of
churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, sacred monuments, monasteries and other
religious buildings were razed.



Purges and deportations





The purges

Left: Beria's January 1940 letter to Stalin, asking permission to execute 346 " enemies of the
CPSU and of the Soviet authorities " who conducted "counter-revolutionary,
right-Trotskyite plotting and spying activities."

Middle: Stalin's handwriting: "за" (support).

Right: The Politburo's decision is signed by Secretary Stalin. Stalin, as head of the
Politburo , consolidated near-absolute power in the 1930s with a Great Purge of the party,
justified as an attempt to expel 'opportunists' and 'counter-revolutionary
infiltrators'. Those targeted by the purge were often expelled from the party, however more
severe measures ranged from banishment to the Gulag labor camps , to execution after trials
held by NKVD troikas .

The purges commenced after the assassination of Sergei Kirov , the popular leader of the party
in Leningrad. Kirov was very close to Stalin and his assassination sent chills through the
Bolshevik party. Publicly Stalin merely reacted to this assassination by tightening
security by seeking out alleged spies and counter-revolutionaries, but in effect he was
removing those who might have threatened his leadership. This process then transformed
itself into extensive purges.

There are two different views on the background of Kirov's murder. According to the first,
Stalin was not involved but, fearing that he might be next in line to be assassinated, reacted
by deciding to initiate purges instead of passively wait. According to the second, Stalin saw
Kirov as a dangerous potential competitor for the top spot in Soviet leadership, and ordered
Kirov's killing himself.

In the 1930s, Stalin apparently became increasingly worried about Kirov's growing
popularity. At the 1934 Party Congress where the vote for the new Central Committee was held,
Kirov received only three negative votes, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received
292 negative votes, the highest of any candidate. Kirov was a close friend with Sergo
Ordzhonikidze , and together they formed a moderate bloc in the Politburo. Later in 1934,
Stalin asked Kirov to work for him in Moscow. One theory suggests that Stalin did this in order
to keep a closer eye on Kirov, this despite the supposed fact that Stalin entirely controlled
the NKVD. Kirov refused, however, and according to the same theory he became a competitor in
Stalin's eyes.

On December 1 , 1934 , Kirov was killed by Leonid Nikolaev (also seen spelled as Nikolayev) in
the Smolny Institute Leningrad. Kirov had arrived at the Smolny to work in his office, and,
apparently leaving his bodyguard downstairs, headed to the upper floors, where the
officials had their rooms. Nikolayev emerged from a bathroom and followed Kirov towards his
office, shooting him in the back of the neck. Officially Stalin claimed that Nikolayev was
part of a larger conspiracy led by Leon Trotsky against the Soviet government. This resulted
in the arrest and execution of Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev, and fourteen others in 1936. The
death of Kirov ignited the great purge where supporters of Trotsky and other suspected
enemies of the state were arrested. It has been speculated that Stalin was the man who ordered
the murder of Kirov, and that the shooting was carried out with the help of the NKVD. However,
although most historians believe that this second version of why and how Kirov was killed is
more likely, it has so far not been unambiguously proven correct and it is still disputed by
some.

Several trials known as the Moscow Trials were held, but the procedures were replicated
throughout the country. There were four key trials during this period: the Trial of the
Sixteen (August 1936); Trial of the Seventeen (January 1937); the trial of Red Army generals,
including Marshal Tukhachevsky (June 1937); and finally the Trial of the Twenty One
(including Bukharin ) in March 1938.

Most notably in the case of alleged Nazi collaborator Tukhachevsky, many military leaders
were convicted of treason. The large scale purging of the officers of the Red Army cost the
Soviet Union dearly during the German invasion of 22 June 1941 , and its aftermath. ^

The repression of so many formerly high-ranking revolutionaries and party members led Leon
Trotsky to claim that a "river of blood" separated Stalin's regime from that of Lenin.
Solzhenitsyn alleges that Stalin drew inspiration from Lenin's regime with the presence of
labor camps and the executions of political opponents that occurred during the Russian Civil
War. Trotsky's August 1940 assassination in Mexico , where he had lived in exile since January
1937, eliminated the last of Stalin's opponents among the former Party leadership. Only
three members of the " Old Bolsheviks " (Lenin's Politburo ) now remained—Stalin himself,
"the all-Union Chieftain" (всесоюзный староста) Mikhail Kalinin , and
Chairman of Sovnarkom Vyacheslav Molotov .

Nikolai Yezhov , the young man strolling with Stalin to his left in this photo from the 1930s,
was shot in 1940. Following his death, he was edited out of the photo by Soviet censors [8] . Such
retouching was a common occurrence during Stalin's reign. No segment of society was left
untouched during the purges. Article 58 of the legal code, listing prohibited "anti-Soviet
activities", was applied in the broadest manner. Initially, the execution lists for the
enemies of the people were confirmed by the Politburo.

Over time the procedure was greatly simplified and delegated down the line of command. People
would inform on others arbitrarily, to attempt to redeem themselves, or to gain small
retributions. The flimsiest pretexts were often enough to brand someone an " enemy of the
people ," starting the cycle of public persecution and abuse, often proceeding to
interrogation, torture and deportation, if not death. Nadezhda Mandelstam , the widow of the
poet Osip Mandelstam and one of the key memoirists of the purges, recalls being shouted at by
Akhmatova: "Don't you understand? They are arresting people for nothing now?" The Russian
word troika gained a new meaning: a quick, simplified trial by a committee of three
subordinated to NKVD .

Towards the end of the purge, the Politburo relieved NKVD head Nikolai Yezhov , from his
position for overzealousness. He was subsequently executed. Some historians such as Amy
Knight and Robert Conquest postulate that Stalin had Yezhov and his predecessor, Genrikh
Yagoda , removed in order to deflect blame from himself.

In parallel with the purges, efforts were made to rewrite the history in Soviet textbooks and
other propaganda materials. Notable people executed by NKVD were removed from the texts and
photographs as though they never existed. Gradually, the history of revolution was
transformed to a story about just two key characters: Lenin and Stalin .

In light of revelations from the Soviet archives, historians now estimate that nearly
700,000 people were executed in the course of the terror, [37] with the great mass of victims
being ordinary peasants and workers. [38]

In addition, Stalin dispatched a contingent of NKVD operatives to Mongolia , had a Mongolian
version of the troika established and unleashed a bloody purge in which tens of thousands were
executed as 'Japanese Spies.' Mongolian ruler Khorloogiin Choibalsan closely followed
Stalin's lead. [39]

It is worth noting that 2007 tours of Stalin's Museum in Gori, Georgia reference the purges
only in passing. "Sure, during the process of collectivization, some mistakes were made" is
the official line at the museum. No other references to mortalities are made during the tour,
and when asked about actual fatalities, the estimate of 25,000 is given. __________________

Main article: Holodomor

The Holodomor famine is sometimes referred to as the Ukrainian Genocide , [40] [41] [42] [43]
implying that the Holodomor was engineered by the Soviet government, specifically
targeting the Ukrainian people to destroy the Ukrainian nation as a political factor and
social entity. [44] While historians continue to disagree whether the policies that led to
Holodomor fall under the legal definition of genocide , twenty six countries have officially
recognized the Holodomor as such. On 28 November 2006 the Ukrainian Parliament approved a
bill, according to which the Soviet-era forced famine was an act of genocide against the
Ukrainian people. [45]

Meeting in a prison cell





Shortly before, during and immediately after World War II , Stalin conducted a series of
deportations on a huge scale which profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union. It
is estimated that between 1941 and 1949 nearly 3.3 million [46] were deported to Siberia and
the Central Asian republics. Separatism, resistance to Soviet rule and collaboration with
the invading Germans were cited as the official reasons for the deportations, rightly or
wrongly. Historian Allan Bullock explains: Many no doubt had collaborated with the
occupying forces … but many had done so not out of disloyalty but from the instinct to survive
when abandoned to their fate by the retreating Soviet armies. The individual circumstances
were of no interest to Stalin … After the brief Nazi occupation of the Caucasus was over …
the entire population of five of the small highland peoples of the North Caucasus, as well as
the Crimean Tatars — more than a million souls — (were deported) without notice or any
opportunity to take their possessions. There were certainly collaborators among these
peoples, but most of those had fled with the Germans. The majority of those left were old folk,
women, and children; their men were away fighting at the front, where the Chechens and
Ingushes alone produced thirty-six Heroes of the Soviet Union. [47]

During Stalin's rule the following ethnic groups were deported completely or partially:
Ukrainians , Poles , Koreans , Volga Germans , Crimean Tatars , Kalmyks , Chechens , Ingush ,
Balkars , Karachays , Meskhetian Turks , Finns , Bulgarians , Greeks , Latvians , Lithuanians ,
Estonians , and Jews . Large numbers of Kulaks , regardless of their nationality, were
resettled to Siberia and Central Asia . Deportations took place in appalling conditions,
often by cattle truck, and hundreds of thousands of deportees died en route. [48] Those who
survived were forced to work without pay in the labour camps. Many of the deportees died of
hunger or other conditions.

In February 1956, Nikita Khrushchev condemned the deportations as a violation of Leninist
principles, and reversed most of them, although it was not until as late as 1991 that the
Tatars, Meskhs and Volga Germans were allowed to return en masse to their homelands. The
deportations had a profound effect on the peoples of the Soviet Union. The memory of the
deportations played a major part in the separatist movements in the Baltic States, Tatarstan
and Chechnya , even today.



Number of victims





Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/40px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png

The neutrality of this section is disputed .

Please see the discussion on the talk page . (April 2008)

Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved. Early researchers
attempting to tally the number of people killed under Stalin's regime were forced to rely
largely upon anecdotal evidence. Their estimates ranged from a low of 3 million to as high as 60
million. [49] [50] After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, evidence from the Soviet
archives became available. The archives record that about 800,000 prisoners were executed
(for either political or criminal offences) under Stalin, while about 1.7 million died in the
GULAG and some 389,000 perished during kulak forced resettlement — a total of about 3
million victims.

Debate continues, however, [51] since some historians believe the archival figures to be
unreliable. [52] [53] For example, some argue that the many suspects tortured to death while
in "investigative custody" were likely not counted amongst the executed. [54] [5] Also,
there are certain categories of victim which it is generally agreed were carelessly recorded
by the Soviets — such as the victims of ethnic deportations, or of German population
transfer in the aftermath of WWII.

Thus while some archival researchers have estimated the number of victims of Stalin's
repressions to be no more than about 4 million in total, [55] [56] [57] others believe the
number to be considerably higher. Russian writer Vadim Erlikman, [58] for example, makes the
following estimates: executions, 1.5 million; gulags, 5 million; deportations, 1.7
million (out of 7.5 million deported); and POWs and German civilians, 1 million — a total of
about 9 million victims of repression.

Some historians have also included the 6 to 8 million victims of the 1932–1933 famine as
victims of repression. [24] [59] [60] This categorization is controversial however, as
historians differ as to whether the famine was a deliberate part of the campaign of repression
against kulaks or simply an unintended consequence of the struggle over forced
collectivization. (See also: Droughts and famines in Russia and the USSR ).

Regardless, it appears that a minimum of around 10 million surplus deaths (4 million by
repression and 6 million from famine) are attributable to the regime, with a number of recent
books suggesting a likely total of around 20 million. [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] Adding 6–8
million famine victims to Erlikman's estimates above, for example, would yield a total of
between 15 and 17 million victims. Pioneering researcher Robert Conquest , meanwhile, has
revised his original estimate of up to 30 million victims down to 20 million. [66] Others,
however, continue to maintain that their earlier much higher estimates are correct. [67]

Molotov and Stalin, 1944.





After the failure of Soviet and Franco-British talks on a mutual defense pact in Moscow,
Stalin began to negotiate a non-aggression pact with Hitler's Nazi Germany. There is a
version that in his speech on August 19 , 1939 , Stalin prepared his comrades for the great turn
in Soviet policy, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany . According to a
controversial Russian author living in the UK, Viktor Suvorov , Stalin expressed in the
speech an expectation that the war would be the best opportunity to weaken both the Western
nations and Nazi Germany, and make Germany suitable for "Sovietization". Whether this
speech was ever delivered to the public and what its content was is still debated.

Officially a non-aggression treaty only, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact had a secret annex
according to which Central Europe was divided into the two powers' respective spheres of
influence. The USSR was promised an eastern part of Poland , primarily populated with
Ukrainians and Belarusians in case of its dissolution, as long as Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia
and Finland were recognized as parts of the Soviet sphere of influence. Another clause of the
treaty was that Bessarabia , then part of Romania, was to be joined to the Moldovan ASSR, and
become the Moldovan SSR under control of Moscow.

On September 1 , 1939 , the German invasion of Poland started World War II , and on September 17
the Red Army invaded eastern Poland and occupied the territory assigned to it by the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

In November 1939, Stalin sent troops over the Finnish border, provoking a war of aggression ,
and probably intended to annex Finland into the Soviet Union, as he had already done in Latvia,
Lithuania, and Estonia. But the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland proved to be
far more difficult than Stalin and the Red Army were prepared for, and the Soviets sustained
surprisingly high casualties. By some estimates, the Soviet Union lost as many as 391,800
lives in this four-month war against Finland alone, or more than the United States suffered in
all of World War II against Germany and Japan (1941–1945). The Soviets finally agreed on an
interim peace in March, 1940, but only succeeded in annexing the eastern region of Karelia
(10% of Finnish territory), a classic example of a Pyrrhic victory . Finland remains an
independent country to the present day, but the Red Armies' serious problems had been
revealed to the rest of the world, including Germany.

On March 5, 1940, the Soviet leadership approved an order of execution for more than 25,700
Polish "nationalist, educators and counterrevolutionary" activists in the parts of the
Ukraine and Belarus republics that had been annexed from Poland. This event has become known
as the Katyn Massacre . [68]

In June 1941, Hitler broke the pact and invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa , thus
beginning the Great Patriotic War . Although expecting war with Germany, Stalin may not have
expected an invasion to come so soon—and the Soviet Union was relatively unprepared for
this invasion. An alternative theory suggested by Viktor Suvorov claims that Stalin had made
aggressive preparations from the late 1930s on and was about to invade Germany in summer 1941.
Thus, he believes Hitler only managed to forestall Stalin and the German invasion was in
essence a pre-emptive strike . This theory was supported by Igor Bunich , Mikhail Meltyukhov
(see Stalin's Missed Chance ) and Edvard Radzinsky (see Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography
Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives ). However, most western
historians reject this thesis.

In the diary of General Fedor von Boch , it is also mentioned that the Abwehr fully expected a
Soviet attack against German forces in Poland no later than 1942. Such speculations are
difficult to substantiate, however, as information on the Soviet Army from 1939 to 1941
remains classified, but it is known that the Soviets had received some warnings of the German
invasion through their foreign intelligence agents, such as Richard Sorge .

The Big Three: Stalin, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt , and British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill at the Tehran Conference , November 1943.





Even though Stalin received intelligence warnings of a German attack, [69] he sought to avoid
any obvious defensive preparation which might further provoke the Germans, in the hope of
buying time to modernize and strengthen his military forces. In the initial hours after the
German attack commenced, Stalin hesitated, wanting to ensure that the German attack was
sanctioned by Hitler, rather than the unauthorized action of a rogue general. [5]

The Germans initially made huge advances, capturing and killing millions of Soviet troops.
The Soviet Red Army put up fierce resistance during the war's early stages. Even so, they were
plagued by an ineffective defense doctrine against the well-trained and experienced German
forces, despite quite modern equipment, such as first heavy tank in the world, the KV-1 .

Stalin feared that Hitler would use disgruntled Soviet citizens to fight his regime,
particularly people imprisoned in the Gulags . He thus ordered the NKVD to take care of the
situation . They responded by murdering around one hundred thousand political prisoners
throughout the western parts of the Soviet Union, with methods that included bayoneting
people to death and tossing grenades into crowded cells. [70] Many others were simply
deported east. [71] [72] [73]

Hitler's experts had expected eight weeks of war, and early indications appeared to support
their predictions. However, the invading German forces were eventually driven back in
December 1941 near Moscow .

Stalin met in several conferences with Churchill and/or Roosevelt in Moscow, Tehran , Yalta ,
and Potsdam to plan military strategy (Truman taking the place of the deceased Roosevelt).

The Big Three: British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , U.S. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Stalin at the Yalta Conference , February 1945.





In these conferences, his first appearances on the world stage, Stalin proved to be a
formidable negotiator. Anthony Eden , the British Foreign Secretary noted:

"Marshal Stalin as a negotiator was the toughest proposition of all. Indeed, after something
like thirty years' experience of international conferences of one kind and another, if I had
to pick a team for going into a conference room, Stalin would be my first choice. Of course the
man was ruthless and of course he knew his purpose. He never wasted a word. He never stormed, he
was seldom even irritated." [74]

His shortcomings as strategist are frequently noted regarding massive Soviet loss of life
and early Soviet defeats. An example of it is the summer offensive of 1942, which led to even
more losses by the Red Army and recapture of initiative by the Germans. Stalin eventually
recognized his lack of know-how and relied on his professional generals to conduct the war.

Clement Attlee , Harry Truman and Stalin at the Potsdam Conference , July 1945





Yet Stalin did rapidly move Soviet industrial production east of the Volga River, far from
Luftwaffe -reach, to sustain the Red Army 's war machine with astonishing success.
Additionally, Stalin was well aware that other European armies had utterly disintegrated
when faced with Nazi military efficacy and responded effectively by subjecting his army to
galvanizing terror and unrevolutionary, nationalist appeals to patriotism. He also
appealed to the Russian Orthodox church and images of national Russian heroes. On November 6 ,
1941 , Stalin addressed the whole nation of the Soviet Union for the second time (the first time
was earlier that year on July 2 ).

According to Stalin's Order No. 227 of July 27 , 1942 , any commander or commissar of a regiment,
battalion or army, who allowed retreat without permission from above was subject to military
tribunal. The Soviet soldiers who surrendered were declared traitors; however most of those
who survived the brutality of German captivity were mobilized again as they were freed.
Between 5% and 10% of them were sent to Gulag (As "traitors of Homeland". Soviet Criminal Code,
§58, clause 1B: criminal conviction — 10 or later 25 years of labor camp plus 5 years without
"citizen rights").

Time magazine ( 1943 - 01-04 ). Time had previously named Stalin Man of the Year for the year
1939.





In the war's opening stages, the retreating Red Army also sought to deny resources to the enemy
through a scorched earth policy of destroying the infrastructure and food supplies of areas
before the Germans could seize them. This, along with abuse by German troops, caused
starvation and suffering among the civilian population that were left behind.

According to recent figures, of an estimated four million POWs taken by the Russians,
including Germans, Japanese , Hungarians , Romanians and others, some 580,000 never
returned, presumably victims of privation or the Gulags, compared with 3.5 million Soviet
POW that died in German camps out of the 5.6 million taken. [75]

Returning Soviet soldiers who had surrendered were viewed with suspicion and some were
killed. According to historian Alan Bullock : The huge number of Russian troops taken
prisoner in the first eighteen months of the war convinced Stalin that many of them must have
been traitors who had deserted at the first opportunity. Any soldier who had been a prisoner
was henceforth suspect … All such, whether generals, officers, or ordinary soldiers, were
sent to special concentration camps where the NKVD investigated them … Twenty percent were
sentenced to death or twenty-five years in camps; only 15 to 20 percent were allowed to return
to their homes. The remainder were condemned to shorter sentences (five to ten years), to
exile in Siberia, and forced labor — or were killed or died on the way home. [76]

Stalin and Zhukov on the tribune of Lenin's Mausoleum .





Domestically, Stalin was seen as a great wartime leader who had led the Soviets to victory
against the Nazis. His early cooperation with Hitlerism was forgotten. That cooperation
included helping the German Army violate the Versailles Treaty limitations with training in
the Soviet Union, the notorious Molotov-von Ribbentrop treaty which partitioned Poland
(giving the Soviet Union what is now Belarus), and granted the Soviet Union a free hand in
Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, and Soviet trade with Hitler to counteract the
expected French and British trade blockades.

By the end of the 1940s, Russian patriotism increased due to successful propaganda efforts.
For instance, some inventions and scientific discoveries were claimed by Russian
propaganda. Examples include the boiler , reclaimed by father and son Cherepanovs ; the
electric bulb , by Yablochkov and Lodygin ; the radio , by Popov ; and the airplane, by Mozhaysky
. Stalin's internal repressive policies continued (including in newly acquired
territories), but never reached the extremes of the 1930s, in part because the smarter party
functionaries had learned caution.

Internationally, Stalin viewed Soviet consolidation of power as a necessary step to protect
the USSR by surrounding it with countries with friendly governments like the variety seen in
Finland, to act as a cordon sanitaire (buffer) against possible invaders, while the "West"
sought a similar buffer against communist expansion. These competing policies led to an
admirable stability, where successful Soviet aggression would depend on enthusiastic
cooperation by the satellite nations.

He had hoped that the American withdrawal and demobilization would lead to increased
communist influence, especially in Europe. Each side might view the other's defensive
actions as destabilizing provocations and these security dilemmas frayed relations
between the Soviet Union and its former World War II western allies and led to a prolonged
period of tension and distrust between East and West known as the Cold War (see also Iron
curtain ).

The Red Army ended World War II occupying much of the territory that had been formerly held by
the Axis countries:

In Asia , the Red Army had overrun Manchuria in the last month of the war and then also occupied
Korea above the 38th parallel north . Mao Zedong 's Communist Party of China , though receptive
to minimal Soviet support, defeated the pro-Western and heavily American-assisted Chinese
Nationalist Party in the Chinese Civil War .

Stalin and Mao Zedong on Chinese Postage stamp





The Communists controlled mainland China while the Nationalists held a rump state on the
island of Formosa (now Taiwan ). The Soviet Union soon after recognized Mao's People's
Republic of China , which it regarded as a new ally. The People's Republic claimed Taiwan,
though it had never held authority there.

Diplomatic relations reached a high point with the signing of the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty of
Friendship and Alliance . Both countries provided military support to a new friendly state in
North Korea . After various border conflicts, war broke out with U.S.-allied South Korea in
1950, starting the Korean War .

In Europe , there were Soviet occupation zones in Germany and Austria. Hungary and Poland were
under practical military occupation. From 1946–1948 coalition governments comprising
communists were elected in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Romania and Bulgaria and
homegrown communist movements rose to power in Yugoslavia and Albania .

These nations became known as the "Communist Bloc." Britain and the United States supported
the anti-communists in the Greek Civil War and suspected the Soviets of supporting the Greek
communists although Stalin refrained from getting involved in Greece, dismissing the
movement as premature. Albania remained an ally of the Soviet Union, but Yugoslavia broke
with the USSR in 1948. Greece , Italy and France received enormous support from the
population, which were at the very least friendly towards Moscow.

Both Superpowers viewed Germany as key. In retaliation to the Western formation of Trizonia ,
Stalin determined to take action.

Armed with intelligence from the British agent Donald Duart Maclean and other British and
American espionage agents, Stalin was well aware that the United States had not proceeded
with mass production of atomic weapons, indeed, had not even assembled any after the last was
used at Nagasaki. Large numbers would have been needed to destroy Soviet or Communist land
forces either in Europe or the Far East. He therefore ordered a blockade of West Berlin , which
was under British, French, and U.S. occupation, to test the Western powers.

The Berlin Blockade failed due to the unexpected massive aerial resupply campaign carried
out by the Western powers known as the Berlin Airlift . In 1949, Stalin conceded defeat and
ended the blockade. After West Germany was formed by the union of the three Western occupation
zones, the Soviets declared East Germany a separate country in 1949, ruled by the communists.

Stalin originally supported the creation of Israel in 1948. The USSR was one of the first
nations to recognize the new country. [77] Golda Meir came to Moscow as the first Israeli
Ambassador to the USSR that year. But he later changed his mind and came out against Israel.

Contrary to America's policy which restrained armament (limited equipment was provided for
infantry and police forces) to South Korea, Stalin also extensively armed Kim Il Sung 's North
Korean army and air forces with military equipment (to include T-34/85 tanks) and "advisors"
far in excess of that required for defensive purposes) in order to facilitate Kim's (a former
Soviet Officer) aim to conquer the rest of the Korean peninsula. Soviet pilots flew Soviet
aircraft from Chinese bases against United Nations aircraft defending South Korea. Post
cold war research in Soviet Archives reveal that the Korean War was begun by Kim Il-sung with
the express permission of Stalin, though this is widely disputed by North Korea.

In Stalin's last year of life, one of his last major foreign policy initiatives was the 1952
Stalin Note for German reunification and Superpower disengagement from Central Europe , but
Britain, France, and the United States viewed this with suspicion and rejected the offer.



Stalin as theorist



Main article: Stalinism

Stalin made few contributions to Communist (or, more specifically, Marxist-Leninist)
theory. The contributions he made were accepted and upheld by all Soviet political
scientists during his rule.

Among Stalin's contributions were his "Marxism and the National Question", a work praised by
Lenin; his "Trotskyism or Leninism", which was a factor in the "liquidation of Trotskyism as
an ideological trend" within the CPSU(B).

Stalin's Collected Works (in 13 volumes) was released in 1949. A subsequent 16 volume
American Edition appeared, in which one volume consisted of the book "History of the CPSU(B)
Short Course", although when released in 1938 this book was credited to a commission of the
Central Committee.

In 1933, Stalin put forward the theory of aggravation of the class struggle along with the
development of socialism , arguing that the further the country would move forward, the more
acute forms of struggle will be used by the doomed remnants of exploiter classes in their last
desperate efforts — and that, therefore, political repression was necessary.

In 1936, Stalin announced that the society of the Soviet Union consisted of two
non-antagonistic classes: workers and kolkhoz peasantry. These corresponded to the two
different forms of property over the means of production that existed in the Soviet Union:
state property (for the workers) and collective property (for the peasantry). In addition to
these, Stalin distinguished the stratum of intelligentsia . The concept of
"non-antagonistic classes" was entirely new to Leninist theory.

Stalin and his supporters have highlighted the notion that socialism can be built and
consolidated by a country as underdeveloped as Russia during the 1920s. Indeed this might be
the only means in which it could be built in a hostile environment. [78] __________________

Stalin's body lying in state in the House of Trade Unions in Moscow .





On March 1 , 1953 , after an all-night dinner in his residence in Krylatskoye some 15 km west of
Moscow centre with interior minister Lavrentiy Beria and future premiers Georgy Malenkov ,
Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev , Stalin did not emerge from his room, having probably
suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body.

Although his guards thought that it was odd for him not to rise at his usual time, they were under
orders not to disturb him. He was discovered lying on the floor of his room only at about 10pm in
the evening. Lavrentiy Beria was informed and arrived a few hours afterwards, and the doctors
arrived only in the early morning of March, 2nd. Stalin died four days later, on March 5 , 1953 ,
at the age of 74, and was embalmed on March 9 . His daughter Svetlana recalls the scene as she
stood by his death bed: "He suddenly opened his eyes and cast a glance over everyone in the room.
It was a terrible glance. Then something incomprehensible and awesome happened. He suddenly
lifted his left hand as though he were pointing to something above and bringing down a curse
upon all of us. The next moment after a final effort the spirit wrenched itself free of the
flesh." Officially, the cause of death was listed as a cerebral hemorrhage . His body was
preserved in Lenin's Mausoleum until October 31 , 1961 , when his body was removed from the
Mausoleum and buried next to the Kremlin walls as part of the process of de-Stalinization .

Stalin's Grave by the Kremlin Wall Necropolis





It has been suggested that Stalin was assassinated. The ex-Communist exile Avtorkhanov
argued this point as early as 1975. The political memoirs of Vyacheslav Molotov , published in
1993, claimed that Beria had boasted to Molotov that he poisoned Stalin: "I took him out."

Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that Beria had, immediately after the stroke, gone about
"spewing hatred against [Stalin] and mocking him", and then, when Stalin showed signs of
consciousness, dropped to his knees and kissed his hand. When Stalin fell unconscious again,
Beria immediately stood and spat.

In 2003, a joint group of Russian and American historians announced their view that Stalin
ingested warfarin , a powerful rat poison that inhibits coagulation of the blood and so
predisposes the victim to hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral hemorrhage). Since it is
flavorless, warfarin is a plausible weapon of murder. The facts surrounding Stalin's death
will probably never be known with certainty. [79]

His demise arrived at a convenient time for Beria and others, who feared being swept away in yet
another purge. It is believed that Stalin felt Beria's power was too great and threatened his
own. Whether or not Beria or another usurper was directly responsible for his death, it is true
that the Politburo did not summon medical attention for Stalin for more than a day after he was
found.

Stalin's death mask in Gori, Georgia





N.B. Radzinsky in Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents From
Russia's Secret Archives notes, that while Stalin was preparing Beria's downfall, Beria
first had Stalin's head of security killed and this allowed Beria to interfere with the
bodyguard arrangements for "the Boss". The head of security on that night gave the guards the
unprecedented order, allegedly from the Boss, that they were not required that night and they
could go to bed. Next morning there was no activity from the Boss's room.

This was extremely convenient since the purge — which had already started against the
Jewish doctors, was scheduled to start reaching up the current Politburo members including
Beria and Khrushchev, not to mention the already deposed Molotov.

According to Radzinsky, this was also the resumption of the Terror, in order to ensure
absolute obedience of the nation in anticipation of a planned nuclear war. Apparently Stalin
intended to use his lead in the development of a hydrogen bomb to his advantage, by engineering
a conflict with the West. This, he thought, could be achieved by building on the show trials of
"the Jewish doctors" , and embracing an anti-semitic expulsion of "the Jews" to Siberia.

Ekaterina "Kato" Svanidze , Stalin's first wife.





Stalin met his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in late 1905 when he moved into the Tiflis
townhouse where she lived. They were married on the night of July 28 1906. On March 31 1907, she
gave birth to Stalin's first child, Yakov. In June 1907, after robbing the bank in Tiflis to
fund the Bolshevik cause, Stalin and his family fled east to Baku. Stalin was frequently
absent as he conducted revolutionary work across Georgia. Meanwhile, his Ekaterina
suffered under the pollution and heat of Baku, which was an oil boomtown. She contracted
typhus and died on December 5 1907. Stalin was devastated by her death; fearing he was
suicidal, his friends took away his pistol.

Stalin with his children: Vasiliy and Svetlana.





His son finally shot himself because of Stalin's harshness toward him, but survived. After
this, Stalin said "He can't even shoot straight". Yakov served in the Red Army during World War
II and was captured by the Germans. They offered to exchange him for Field Marshal Friedrich
Paulus , who had surrendered after Stalingrad, but Stalin turned the offer down, allegedly
saying "A lieutenant is not worth a general"; others credit him with saying "I have no son," to
this offer. Afterwards, Yakov is said to have committed suicide, running into an electric
fence [80] in Sachsenhausen concentration camp , where he was being held. [81]

Stalin had a son, Vasiliy , and a daughter, Svetlana , with his second wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva
. She died in 1932, officially of illness. She may have committed suicide by shooting herself
after a quarrel with Stalin, leaving a suicide note which according to their daughter was
"partly personal, partly political". [82] According to A&E Biography, there is also a belief
among some Russians that Stalin himself murdered his wife after the quarrel, which
apparently took place at a dinner in which Stalin tauntingly flicked cigarettes across the
table at her. Historians also claim that her death ultimately "severed his [Stalin's] link
from reality." [83]

Stalin and Nadezhda Alliluyeva.





Vasiliy rose through the ranks of the Soviet air force , officially dying of alcoholism in
1962; however, this is still in question. He distinguished himself in World War II as a capable
airman. Svetlana emigrated to the United States in 1967.

In his book The Wolf of the Kremlin Stuart Kahan claimed that Stalin was secretly married to a
third wife named Rosa Kaganovich, allegedly the sister of Lazar Kaganovich , a Soviet
politician. However, the claim is unproven and many have disputed it, including the
Kaganovich family, who deny that "Rosa" and Stalin ever met, and even state that Kaganovich's
sister wasn't named Rosa. Kahan also claimed that both Lazar and Rosa were responsible for the
death of Stalin (by poisoning), however this (as well as most of the remainder of Kahan's
assertions) were dismissed as fabrication by the Statement of the Kaganovich Family .

In March 2001 Russian Independent Television NTV discovered a previously unknown grandson
living in Novokuznetsk . Yuri Davydov told NTV that his father had told him of his lineage, but,
because the campaign against Stalin's cult of personality was in full swing at the time, he was
told to keep quiet. The Soviet dissident writer, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn , had mentioned a son
being born to Stalin and his common-law wife Lida in 1918, during Stalin's exile in northern
Siberia .



Religious beliefs



Stalin's beliefs are complicated and sometimes contradictory. As the historians Vladislav
Zubok and Constantine Pleshakov noted, he received his education at Theological Seminary at
Tiflis ( Tbilisi ), where his mother sent him to become a priest, but he became a closet atheist.
[84] Zubok and Pleshakov further noted, "Many would later note, however, that his works were
influenced by a distinctly Biblical style" and "his atheism remained rooted in some vague
idea of a God of nature." [84]

Regarding one famous claim about evolution, historians doubt one later Soviet claim that he
read The Origin of Species at the age of thirteen while still at Gori, and told a fellow pupil
that it proved the nonexistence of God. The story fails on several obvious accounts,
including Stalin's remaining religious, even pious, for some years longer. [85] In fact
Professor of Religion Hector Avalos noted, "Stalin, in fact, had a complex relationship with
religious institutions in the Soviet Union." [86]

Historian Edvard Radzinsky used recently discovered secret archives and noted a story that
changed Stalin's attitude toward religion. [87] The story in which Ilya, Metropolitan of the
Lebanon Mountains, claimed to receive a sign from heaven that "The churches and monasteries
must be reopened throughout the country. Priests must be brought back from imprisonment,
Leningrad must not be surrendered, but the sacred icon of Our Lady of Kazan should be carried
around the city boundary, taken on to Moscow, where a service should be held, and thence to
Stalingrad Tsaritsyn ." [87] Shortly thereafter, Stalin's attitude changed and "Whatever
the reason, after his mysterious retreat, he began making his peace with God. Something
happened which no historian has yet written about. On his orders many priests were brought
back to the camps. In Leningrad, besieged by the Germans and gradually dying of hunger, the
inhabitants were astounded, and uplifted, to see wonder-working icon Our Lady of Kazan
brought out into the streets and borne in procession." [87] Radzinsky asked, "Had he seen the
light? Had fear made him run to his Father? Had the Marxist God-Man simply decided to exploit
belief in God? Or was it all of these things at once?." [87]

During the Second World War Stalin reopened the Churches. One reason could have been to
motivate the majority of the population who had Christian beliefs. The reasoning behind this
is that by changing the official policy of the party and the state towards religion, the Church
and its clergymen could be to his disposal in mobilizing the war effort. __________________

Roses for Stalin (1949), painting by Boris Vladimirski .





Stalin created a cult of personality in the Soviet Union around both himself and Lenin. The
embalming of the Soviet founder in Lenin's Mausoleum was performed over the objection of
Lenin's widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya . Stalin became the focus of massive adoration and even
worship.

Numerous towns, villages and cities were renamed after the Soviet leader (see List of places
named after Stalin ) and the Stalin Prize and Stalin Peace Prize were named in his honor. He
accepted grandiloquent titles (e.g. "Coryphaeus of Science," "Father of Nations,"
"Brilliant Genius of Humanity," "Great Architect of Communism," "Gardener of Human
Happiness," and others), and helped rewrite Soviet history to provide himself a more
significant role in the revolution. At the same time, according to Khrushchev , he insisted
that he be remembered for "the extraordinary modesty characteristic of truly great people."

Many statues and monuments were erected to glorify Stalin but all of them distorted Stalin's
true build. Going by these monuments and statues it would be easy to assume that Stalin was a
tall and well built man not unlike Tsar Alexander III . This was not the case however;
photographic evidence suggests he was between 5 ft 5 in and 5 ft 6 in (165–168 cm) [9] . His
physical stature was exaggerated in all portraits and statues to avoid any image of weakness
that could harm his cult of personality .

Trotsky criticized the cult of personality built around Stalin as being against the values of
socialism and Bolshevism, in that it exalted the individual above the party and class and it
disallowed criticism of Stalin. The personality cult reached new levels during the Great
Patriotic War , with Stalin's name even being included in the new Soviet national anthem . The
reference was later removed during the process of De-Stalinization . Also the soldiers of the
Red Army when they charged into battle, they would not only yell out "FOR THE MOTHERLAND", but
also most, if not all would also yell out "FOR STALIN". Also the Iosif Stalin tank class was
named after Stalin.

Stalin became the focus of a body of literature encompassing poetry as well as music,
paintings and film. Artists and writers vied with each other in fawning devotion, crediting
Stalin with almost god-like qualities, and suggesting he single-handedly won the Second
World War.

It is debatable as to how much Stalin relished the cult surrounding him. The Finnish communist
Tuominen records a sarcastic toast proposed by Stalin at a New Year Party in 1935: Comrades! I
want to propose a toast to our patriarch, life and sun, liberator of nations, architect of
socialism [he rattled off all the appellations applied to him in those days] — Joseph
Vissarionovich Stalin, and I hope this is the first and last speech made to that genius this
evening. [88]

In recent years, support of Stalin has resurged. Millions of Russians, exasperated with the
downfall of the economy and political instability after the breakup of the Soviet Union, want
Stalin back. A recent controversial poll revealed that over thirty-five percent of Russians
would vote for Stalin if he were still alive. [89] This is seen by some as a return of Stalin's
cult. In Krasnoyarsk , it has been decided to rebuild a communist-era memorial complex
dedicated to Josef Stalin. [90] Also, a new statue of Stalin is to be erected in Moscow ,
“returning his once-ubiquitous image to the streets after an absence of four decades, a top
city official said yesterday”, as reported by The Scotsman . [91]

A survey from late 2006 revealed that 47% of Russian respondents viewed Stalin as a positive
figure, and only 29% as a negative one. Some controversy also ensued when a recently approved
history textbook for Russia’s schoolchildren attempted to illustrate Stalin’s purges
as a necessary evil in the process of state-building. [92] In July 2008, Stalin topped at the
list of most popular figures of the Russian history and culture in the nationwide television
project " Name of Russia. Historical Choice 2008 " in which 178,881 out of 1,453,390 voted for
him. [93]

Monument to Stalin in Gori, Georgia .





Under Stalin's rule, the Soviet Union was transformed from an agricultural nation into a
global superpower, although at the cost of an estimated 30 million lives. The USSR's
industrialization was successful in that the country was able to defend against and defeat
the Nazi invasion in World War II , though at an enormous cost in human life. In 1957, four years
after Stalin's death, the nation put into orbit the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 .

Libertarian historian Robert Conquest and some other Westerners[ who? ] claim that the USSR
was bound for industrialization, and that its speed along this course was not necessarily
improved by the Bolsheviks.[ citation needed ] Other historians argue that Stalin was partly
responsible for the initial military disasters and enormous human casualties during WWII,
because he eliminated so many experienced military officers during the purges. He
especially attacked the most senior officers and had rejected intelligence warning of the
German attack. [94]

While Stalin's social and economic policies laid the foundations for the USSR's emergence as
a superpower, the harshness with which he conducted Soviet affairs was subsequently
repudiated by his successors in the Communist Party leadership, notably in the denunciation
of Stalinism by Nikita Khrushchev in February 1956. In his "Secret Speech", On the
Personality Cult and its Consequences , delivered to a closed session of the 20th Party
Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for his cult
of personality, and his regime for "violation of Leninist norms of legality".

Stalin's immediate successors preserved major elements of his rule, including the
political monopoly of the Communist Party's presiding over a command economy and a security
service able to suppress dissent. The large-scale purges of Stalin's era were never
repeated, but political repression continued, albeit on a lesser scale.



Nicknames and Pseudonyms



His first name is also transliterated as Iosif . His original surname,
ჯუღაშვილი, is also transliterated as Jugashvili or Jughashvili . The
Russian transliteration is Джугашвили, which is in turn transliterated into
English as Dzhugashvili and Djugashvili ; -შვილი ( -shvili ) is a Georgian suffix
meaning "child" or "son".

There are several etymologies of the ჯუღა ( jugha ) root. In one version, it is the
Ossetian for "rubbish"; the surname Jugayev is common among Ossetians, and before the
revolution the names in South Ossetia were traditionally written with the Georgian suffix,
especially among Christianized Ossetians. In a second version, the name derives from the
village of Jugaani in Kakhetia , eastern Georgia.

An article in the newspaper Pravda in 1988 claimed that the word derives from the Old Georgian
for " steel " which might be the reason for his adoption of the name Stalin. Сталин (
Stalin ) is derived from combining the Russian сталь ( stal ), "steel", with the
possessive suffix -ин ( -in ), a formula used by many other Bolsheviks, including Lenin .

It has also been said that, originally, "Stalin" was a conspiratorial nickname which stuck
with him.

Like other Bolsheviks, he became commonly known by one of his revolutionary noms de guerre , of
which Stalin was only the most prominent. He was also known as Koba , a Robin Hood -like brigand
from the 1883 novel The Patricide by Alexander Kazbegi . [95] During conversations, Vladimir
Lenin always called Stalin "Koba".

Stalin is also reported to have used at least a dozen other names for the purpose of secret
communications.[ citation needed ] Most of them remain unknown.

Directly following World War II, as the Soviets were negotiating with the Allies, Stalin
often sent directions to Molotov as Druzhkov .

Other nicknames, pseudonyms and aliases were Josef Besoshvili ; Besov ; Ivanov ; A. Ivanovich
; Soso or Sosso (mainly his boyhood name); Soselo or Ryaboi Soselo (a youthful nickname),
David K. Kato ; G. Nizharadze or G. Nijeradze ; Chizhikov or Chizhnikov ; Oranness ;
Vartanovich ; Totomyans ; Vassilyi and J.V. Stalin .

Stalin was nicknamed "Uncle Joe" by the Western media. [96]

Birth and death



For very long time the date of birth of Stalin was falsified. [1]

There are a number of hypotheses and popular rumors about the "real" father of Stalin.

See section " Death " for various hypotheses about causes of Stalin's death.



Suspected Tsarist connections



Stalin has been suspected in the past and in the present of being a Tsarist double-agent during
his revolutionary years. Some of this suspicion stems from his ability to evade Tsarists
efforts to capture him. His 1909 efforts to root out traitors caused much strife within the
party; some accused him of doing this deliberately on the orders of the Okhrana. The Menshevik
Razhden Arsenidze said that Stalin was betraying comrades he didn't like to the Okhrana, but
there is no proof of this. His ability to anticipate Okhrana actions may have come from moles
within the organization. Another historian, Simon Sebag Montefiore, found that in all
surviving Okhrana records Stalin is described as a revolutionary and never a spy. [12] In the
1956, the magazine Life published a letter by Colonel Ermin, head of the Tiflis Okhrana, that
said Stalin was an agent, but it has since been shown to be a forgery.

In his 1967 biography of Stalin, Edward Ellis Smith argued that Stalin was an Okhrana agent by
citing his suspicious ability to escape from Okhrana dragnets, travel unimpeded, and
rabble-rouse full time with no apparent source of income. One such example was the raid that
occurred on the night of April 3 1901, when most everyone of importance in the
Socialist-Democratic movement in Tiflis was arrested, except for Stalin, who was
apparently "enjoying the balmy spring air, and in one of his to-hell-with-the-revolution
moods, [which] is too impossible for serious consideration." [97] __________________

Image: http://www.jewwatch.com/gif-stalin-5.jpg In the Georgian language "shvili"
means son of, or son, as in Johnson. "Djuga" means Jew. Therefore Djugashvili means Jewison.

So Joe Stalin's real name, before he changed it, was Joe Jewison. It gets better, his name was
Joseph David Djugashvili, a typical Jewish name. During his revolutionary days he changed
his name to "Kochba", the leader of the Jews during one of the anti-Roman uprisings of the Jews.
Russians don't change their names. Georgians don't change their names. Jews change their
names.



Stalin's wives

Image: http://www.jewwatch.com/gif-stalin-wife-rosa-kagano.jpg Stalin had three
wives, all of them Jewesses.

The first was Ekaterina Svanidze who bore him one son, Jacob. His second wife was Kadya
Allevijah. She bore him a son Vassili, and a daughter Svetlana. His second wife died in
mysterious circumstances, either by committing suicide, or murdered by Stalin. His third
wife was Rosa Kaganovich, the sister of Lazar Kaganovich, who was the head of Soviet industry.

Stalin's daughter (who in 1967 fled to the USA) then married Lazar's son Mihail i.e. her
step-mother's nephew. Svetlana Stalin had a total of four husbands, three of them Jewish.

Stalin's vice-president Molotov was also married to a Jewess, whose brother, Sam Karp, runs
an export business in Connecticut. Just to complicate things even more, the Molotov's
(half-Jewish) daughter also called Svetlana was engaged to be married to Stalin's son
Vassili. Quote: Jewish Love Affair of Comrade Stalin

With Russian Jewess Ana Rubenstein





Image: http://www.jewwatch.com/gif-stalin-1.jpg September 23, 2007 Stalin's Jewish
affair by Dmitri Prokofiev, YNetnews

For more than 50 years, a letter containing astonishing information lay in the basement of the
Russian communist party. The anti-Semitic tyrant who planned mass purges against the Jews
had an affair with a Jewish woman, and also cared for her daughter until she died The communist
tyrant Joseph Stalin was known to be an anti-Semite who planned wide-scale purges against the
Jews in his latter days. Yet the fact that the Soviet ruler planned to annihilate the Jews did
not prevent him from having an affair with a Jewish woman, and to take care of her daughter until
her mother passed away. According to some evidence, Stalin may have even married the woman.
The affair was disclosed recently thanks to a letter discovered by an historian named Nicolai
Nada. The letter, which was placed on the desk of the general secretary of the communist party
Georgi Malenkov in 1953, the day Stalin suffered a stroke, was kept in a classified party file
for years. Just a few months ago those in charge of the file were persuaded to reveal the letter,
and this is what it contained: The Letter of the Daughter of Ana Rubenstein Dear Comrade
Malenkov! I am the daughter of Ana Rubinstein, the former wife of Comrade Stalin.

As he is in ill health, I ask you to let me see him. He knows me since I was a child.

R. Sveshnikova (Kostiokovski). If it is not possible to see him, I ask you to grant me an
audience on a very urgent matter.

Date: 04.03.55 We shall apparently never know what exactly the writer of the letter sought to
tell Stalin, and what the "urgent matter" she wished to discuss with the general-secretary of
the communist party was about. However, Nicolai Nada focused his research on the identity of
Ana Rubinstein, "the former wife of Comrade Stalin," and discovered some astonishing facts.
From the few documents uncovered in the archives it appears that Ana Rubinstein was born
around 1890 in Ukraine. In 1910 she married a Jew named Zalman Kostiovsky, and on 28th
September, 1911 they had a daughter named Regina. The marriage broke up and a year later Ana
came to Saint Petersburg with her daughter, but without her husband. Two Official Wives Nada
believes that Stalin met Ana Rubinstein as early as 1912. He used to visit Saint Petersburg
often, where Rubinstein was affiliated to the city's Bolshevik underground. The affair
between them apparently developed later on, because in 1913 Stalin was apprehended by police
and deported to Siberia from where he returned in the spring of 1917. Regina Sveshnikova –
whom Stalin knew during "her childhood" - was five- and-a-half years old in 1917. The question
which has still not been clarified is whether it was just an affair or whether the couple did
actually marry? This is difficult to answer with any certainty, since all the documents
pertaining to Stalin's personal life were confiscated in the 1920s, and Stalin himself got
rid of any "incriminating" documents. The official version of his biography, published in
the USSR, mentions two "official" women: Yekaterina Svanidze who died of tuberculosis and
Nadezhda Alliluyeva who committed suicide. However, indirect evidence shows that Ana
Rubinstein may also have been a legal wife. The first piece of evidence is associated with the
timeline: Stalin was first seen with the beautiful Alliluyeva in 1917; however he only
married her a year and a half later. In elite communist circles it was whispered that the tyrant
didn't marry because he had not yet divorced his former wife. The problem is that Stalin's
first wife, Yekaterina Svanidze, died in 1907. Another piece of evidence is associated to
Rubinstein herself: It appears that for dozens of years, someone in high places took care of
Rubinstein and her daughter Regina. Ana's grandson, Vitali Sveshnikov, who died recently,
told Nicolai Nada that Ana Rubinstein died in the middle of the 1950s in Leningrad. He
recounted that she had resided in an elite neighborhood on Vasilievsky Island, right
opposite the house where the leadership of the communist party branch lived. Ana and her
daughter stayed in Leningrad during the siege, during which a million residents of the city
died of starvation, yet they remained alive. It is more than likely that the two received food
packages from the party branch. Moreover, Regina Kostiovsky married an engineer named
Vladimir Sveshnikov, and in September 1950 they moved to Moscow. At the same time a wave of
anti-Semitism swept the USSR, and hardly a day went by without Jewish intellectuals being
arrested while the press published vindictive articles against the "Zionists." However
someone in the communist party made sure that the Sveshnikov couple be given a spacious
apartment in a luxurious building near the Taganka Square just a kilometer from the Kremlin,
which was built that same year for academy staff and senior generals. These apartments are
currently being sold for millions of dollars. Name of Street Still Classified Immediately
after moving to Moscow, Regina was hired as an engineer at a classified institute that
developed innovative weaponry. It was just a few month after a confidential decree was issued
by the KGB not to hire Jews to work in security related institutions. Even after she had
dispatched a letter to general-secretary Malenkov she was not fired and she continued
working there until her retirement. This proved that her mother was indeed close to Stalin,
because in 1953 those who made unfounded claims of affiliation to the "people" were deported
to labor camps for "Offenses against the reputation of the State." For six weeks, until April
16th 1953, Regina's letter lay on Malenkov's desk, who was appointed prime minister upon
Stalin's death. It may be assumed that he would not have achieved such a lofty position had he
not been a partner to the story of the tyrant's Jewish wife. On April 16th, following a meeting
attended by only a few senior leaders, Dmitry Sukhanov, director-general of the prime
minister's office ordered the letter to be placed in the party presidents' secret archives.
The letter was not only put in the archives, but into a special file, whose contents were meant
to be kept confidential forever. The letter was kept in the file until the fall of the communist
party and collapse of the Soviet Union. Regina Sveshnikova passed away on January 23rd, 1989
and was laid to rest at a prestigious cemetery. To date the Russian security services ban the
publication of the name of the street on which she resided in Moscow. __________________
