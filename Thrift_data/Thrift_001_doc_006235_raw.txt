Hormones, Anti-Aging and Neuroplasticity

Hormone Balance for Women , No One Has to Die Alone , Sun Valley Wellness Festival , Telomerase ,

How do these topics relate? Well, they were all covered and more at the Sun Valley Wellness
Festival that I attended with four of my authors/speakers this past weekend.

The Sun Valley Wellness Conference was a success for all our authors. They all arrived safely
and Charlotte Tomaino , who is a Neuropsyscholgist, had a wonderful manifestation. Her new
book features a “smart tag” to Jill Bolte Taylor’s TED Talk Â and Charlotte wanted to
meet Jill, who was the keynote speaker at the conference Friday night. Well, Charlotte is very
intentional and when she boarded her plane to Sun Valley who should sit next to her but Jill!
They had a wonderful talk for the hour plus flight, with delays because of weather, and talked
about possible collaboration in the future. Charlotte gave Jill her new book, Â  Awakening
the Brain , and we will see what comes out of this synchronistic meeting.

Jill Bolte Taylor’s keynote was fabulous on Friday night after a nice reception where I got
to speak with her. She is the most inspiring, enthusiastic speaker I have heard so far. The main
points I took away are that we have such power to choose what we want our experience to be and the
brain has such a wonderful way of supporting us. We have trillions of cells in our body. It’s
the equivalent of all the billions of people on Earth times 166. Jill has certain things she
does each day including thanking her brain cells when she wakes up and when she goes to sleep for
the job they are doing. She asked, “What are you going to do with that power?!” I will never
think of my brain in the same way after hearing her story in person.

Charlotte Tomaino, author of Awakening the Brain

Charlotte also covered a lot about the brain and neuro-plasticity in her talk. One of the main
take aways is how much our water consumption affects the brain and its functioning. Our bodies
are made up of 75% water, the brain is made up of 85% water. Most of us are dehydrated and it shows
up as dry mouth, migraines, hypertension, indigestion, constipation, many other symptoms,
but mainly we are starving our brain and body and their functions. SO, Drink Your Water!! Also,
Charlotte talked about making good “Neuro-choices” (a new word). It’s covered in her
new book folks, so you will have to read her book to grasp it completely. Well worth reading and
it’s our first book with smart tags that allow you to open up videos with your smart phone by
clicking on tags printed on the page in the book.

Lama Marut gave a great talk on happiness and what blocks it and encourages it, (his new book, A
Spiritual Renegade’s Guide to the Good Life , also has smart tags). Mary Hayes Grieco gave a
talk to over 100 people on Unconditional Forgiveness and Lani Leary spoke on the topic of
supporting your loved ones in their transition. We had a lovely author dinner together with
Charlotte’s friend and energy worker Brigette Eissewein, and Lama Marut’s wife Cindy,
where everyone shared their story and passion for their work. It was a wonderfully bonding
evening.

Another speaker I was inspired and informed by was Uzzi Reiss, MD . He’s been working as a
gynecologist in Beverly Hills and has worked with over 6,000 patients in the past 15-20 years
to help them with hormone balancing. He talked about the myths and misinformation out there on
hormones and spent the entire time backing up his work with multitudinous scientific studies
that show the benefits of bio-identical hormone therapy. I spoke to one woman who looked 45 but
she was 58. She’s been seeing Dr. Reiss for seven years. I realized that women do not get much
support in this area and there is a lot of fear and misinformation on the topic. It’s inspired
me to get my blood checked and see what hormones I’m low in and get some support. We lose most of
our hormones after our 20s and they decline rapidly after our 50s to very low levels that can
cause all kinds of other physical problems. They can also be an anti-aging strategy because
when you take them lots of things rejuvenate; but I won’t go into detail here. Uzzi has two
books; I’m reading Natural Hormone Balance for Women. But it’s not just women that lose
hormones, men do too.

Another topic that was covered was Telomerase . It’s a therapy that lengthens your
chromosomes. Chromosomes get shorter all the time. There was a Nobel Prize given on the topic
recently to a man and two women.

(From Wikipedia: Â The enzyme telomerase allows for replacement of short bits of DNA known
as telomeres, which are otherwise shortened when a cell divides via mitosis.Â In normal
circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides recursively, at some
point all the progeny will reach their Hayflick limit.[13] With the presence of telomerase,
each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of DNA, and any single cell can then divide
unbounded.)

It’s an exciting new area for anti-aging and general health support and fighting cancer as
well. Many studies have been done and more are in process. Something to pay attention to!

So, lots of exciting new information about the body and wellness and I’m inspired to
integrate a lot of what I learned in Sun Valley into my new days ahead. Maybe you will feel
inspired to check some of this out as well.

Aloha

Wellness Abounds

Sun Valley Wellness Festival

I’m in Idaho now headed to the Sun Valley Wellness Festival with Emily, my Assistant
AcquisitionsÂ Editor. Four of my authors are also on their way to the conference to speak:
Lani Leary, Lama Marut , Mary Hayes Grieco , and Charlotte Tomaino.

I’ve been coming here for many years with my authors. Unfortunately I missed last year, so
I’m excited to be going this year. My dear friend Marcia Duff helps to organize the speakers,
and I will get to see her and her husband, Rick. We’ve known each other since 1982 and have been
“spiritual partners in crime” ever since.

We are about an hour away and we can see a lot of snow on the mountains ahead. The weather forecast
calls for rain and snow. I’m hoping all my authors make it safely to the hotel.

I remember the last time I was here two years ago. I was flying in from Salt Lake City to Sun Valley
Airport directly. We were about 1,000 feet from the runway and the pilot aborted the
landingÂ because he could not see the runway and flew us back to Salt Lake City. There, we
were told that they may flight out to Sun Valley in the morning but there was no guarantee. I had
three of my authors with me and one of them was presenting her talk the next morning! I said “We
are driving to Sun Valley, how far is it?” We got there at about 11 p.m. after a six hour drive.
It was quite an adventure. I’m hoping no one has to repeat this again this weekend!

Jill Bolte Taylor

We are going to a reception this evening for Jill Bolte Taylor, the author of My Stroke of
Insight . Her TED Talk has been viewed over 8 million times. If you haven’t seen it, its one of
the most watched videos on Ted.com, and I highly recommend it. I’m really looking forward to
meeting her and hearing her speak.

I will have lots to report after the weekend and all of the many speakers Emily and I will get to
listen to.

Have a happy Memorial Weekend!
