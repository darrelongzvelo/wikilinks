    A Funny Week Ahead

    posted by Lolo

    To wind down from Art Basel hecticness, we are happy to present two free events next week
    where you can just sit back and laugh…

    Monday night, Movie Mondays presents STELLA SHORTS !Â  From our good friend Jason of
    Model Citizens who set this screening up:

    “Dumb comedy dressed up in a suit!”Â  The Stella Shorts are a collection of short
    homemade sketch-comedy films that were written, produced, and starred Michael Ian
    Black, Michael Showalter, and David Wain of the comedy group The State (along with guest
    actors such as Paul Rudd, Sam Rockwell, Janeane Garafallo, Bradley Cooper, Elizabeth
    Banks, and more).Â  The short films were originally shown at the group’s live stage
    show at the Fez nightclub in New York from 1998 to 2004 and contain the raunchy humor which
    spawned the Stella television show (that ran for one season on Comedy Central in
    2005).Â  Come check out this rare screening of irreverant, chaotic, silly comedy.

    AND, what is possibly the coolest thing ever , the guys caught wind that we were screening
    their stuff and sent along a personalized message for us to watch before the
    screening!Â  It’s the next best thing to having Michael Ian Black shout you out on
    Twitter .

    Then Tuesday night, buckle up for the last CASA DE HA-HA of 2009 !Â  For over a year now
    Sweat has played host to some of South Florida’s absolute finest comedians and this
    second Tuesday is no different!Â  Host Daniel Reskin brings known and unknown comics
    from the local scene to the Sweat stage.Â  No cover and no drink minimums so we hope to see
    you out!

    P.S. Speaking of funny, the South Beach Comedy Festival is just around the corner!Â 
    Visit their site for the whole awesome lineup.

    BOOSH-A-Thon #2 Next Monday!

    posted by Lolo

    If you still haven’t heard of The Mighty Boosh yet, we can see why…Â  It was
    originally on BBC Three (which most of us don’t get over here), and is broadcast late at
    night in the US on Adult Swim .Â  So, that’s why we’re bringing you huge doses of
    BOOSH at Sweat Records!

    We’ll be playing Season 2 (from 2005) starting at 8pm.Â  Meet freaks like Kodiak
    Jack, demonic grandma Nanatoo, The Hitcher, coconut companion Milky Joe and
    everyone’s favorite – transsexual merman and Bailey’s aficionado Old Gregg .

    If this all sounds bizarre, it is.Â  But it’s also brilliant, filled with hilarious
    gags, cheeky pop culture references and lots of music.Â  The screening is free of
    course so we hope you’ll join us!

    Another great week of in-stores coming up, try to come out to a couple of these!Â  They
    are all free or cheap because we love you.

    Monday, November 2nd: Movie Mondays presents a screening of Hedwig and the Angry Inch

    film at 8.30.Â  (Fear not, the Mighty Boosh-a-thons will continue with Season 2 on
    Monday, 11/23 )

    

    Image: http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y266/lolomiami/hedwig.jpg

    Tuesday, November 3rd: All the way from Brooklyn the “November 2009 Homeland Tour”
    brings pop punk group THE HOMEWRECKERS to Miami (featuring Miami ex-pat and
    zine/graphic illustrator Cristy C. Roads )!Â  Listen at myspace.com/wewreckhomes
    .Â  Not only that, but joining them on the bill is a special appearance by Jose El Rey & The
    Love Doctors of Sexy !

    Thursday, November 5th: NYC singer-songwriter-ukulele-master EMILYN BRODSKY rolls
    into town for a set at Sweat!Â  Her album, Greatest Tits , was produced by Brian Viglione
    of The Dresden Dolls and she’s opened for the likes of The Gossip, The Magnetic Fields,
    The Decemberists, The Hold Steady, Against Me!, Kimya Dawson, Ani and more.Â  Listen
    here to her “cupcake punk” and come see her next Thursday night!

    Saturday, November 7th: By popular demand, we’re going to be hosting a vegan potluck at
    Sweat followed by a live performance by JESSE JACKSON !Â  Potlucks are an awesome way to
    meet new people, trade recipes, and eat lots of delicious food.Â  Bring a dish to share
    (8 or more servings) made without dairy, eggs, honey, gelatin and hydrogenated chemical
    stuffs, or simply pay $7 at the door to eat your heart out. If you need ideas of what to make,
    there are literally thousands of great recipes on the internet so look around for some
    inspiration! After the potluck, Miami’s own talented troubadour Jesse Jackson takes
    the Sweat stage for what will surely be a fantastic show.

    Hope to see you around!

    Monday Night BOOSH

    posted by Lolo

    This Movie Monday, come out for BOOSH-A-THON #1 !Â  In case you live in a musty sea cave
    somewhere, The Mighty Boosh is a UK comedy written by and starring Julian Barrat and Noel
    Fielding as jazz maverick Howard Moon and king of the mods Vince Noir, respectively.

    In Season 1 they work in a dilapidated zoo with shaman/gift shop manager Naboo and his
    gorilla familiar Bollo.Â  We’re huge Boosh fans over here as the show is trippy and
    hilarious with most excellent musical references.

    It’s free so come out Monday night and dive headfirst into the BOOSH!
