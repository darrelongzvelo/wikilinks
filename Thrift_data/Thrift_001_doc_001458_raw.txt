Day 256: _ _ _ / _ _ / _ _ . (OMG – The Famous Telegrams)





Image:
http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Header10-238x300.jpg

Sure, social media has become a powerful force for communication and social change. Yes, I can
use it to stalk ex-girlfriends, tend an electronic farm for hundreds of hours with no palpable
rewards, or follow the thoughts and musings of some guy who writes for The Big Bang Theory. But
can I start a war?

Back when dots and dashes were the entire message, not simply a way of adding a winky-face to the
end of an obvious come-on to let you know that I didnâ€™t mean it like an obvious come-on, a
single act of communication could evoke a shit-storm of political poopery. These are the
infamous telegrams that did what ten thousand tweets about Snookiâ€™s baby have yet to
accomplish: basically, anything.



Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/EmsDispatch.jpg

In 1870, German Prince Leopold had been offered the Spanish throne. He declined, but the
French were freaked out about a German-Spanish alliance. France was (and probably still is,
though I havenâ€™t checked today) stuck right between these two powers. In a panic, the
local French ambassador wandered up to King Wilhelm I, the head honcho of Prussia, and
demanded that there never be another German Prince offered to the Spanish throne. Wilhelm,
not one to make promises on forever-ness, said no.

    A report of this conversation was sent from Bad Ems, the vacation spa where Wilhelm had
    been relaxing when all this took place, back to Otto von Bismarck in Berlin. The
    â€˜Ems Dispatchâ€™ was poorly translated by the French media, and France,
    mistakenly believing some snarky insult had taken place, invented the Franco-Prussian
    War. Thatâ€™s over 850,000 casualties because of one telegram. Read more…

Day 251: Yoko, Pre-John





Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Header5.jpg

Yoko Ono has been called many things: an artist, a philanthropist, the anti-Beatle, and
several terms I donâ€™t care to use in mixed company, unless Iâ€™m dealing with
traffic. I never bought into the Dragon-Lady angle. Itâ€™s a cop-out to say that she
broke up the Beatles, when clearly the reasons behind their demise were far more layered and
complex.

Image:
http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RingosMoustache.jpg

Mostly it had to do with Ringo’s 1969 ‘stache.

I will say this. Yoko is a terrible singer. I know, I knowâ€Š â€œartâ€�. But
forget it, her singing voice is simply not aesthetically pleasing to my ears. We used to flip
Lennon 45â€™s over and play the Yoko songs on 33 1/3 RPM so that she sounded more demonic
and lessâ€Š shrieky.

Rather than pen a thousand-word diatribe about why John should not have insisted on including
her in his musical exploits, Iâ€™m going to take a more positive approach and try to learn
about the lady. She is notoriously generous, caretaker of my favorite corner of Central Park,
and hosts one of the most fantastical Twitter feeds youâ€™ll ever read.

    And she had a life before she met John Lennon. Read more…

Day 229: A Drizzle Of Sap





Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Header16.jpg

Over the course of the past 229 days, I have Wikiâ€™ed my way through hundreds of European
villages. Once I actually paused to pen a kilograph on one of these villages, but that was back
on Day #5 when I actually feared I might run out of subject ideas. Today Iâ€™m 224 days
wiser, and no longer willing to spill a dayâ€™s worth of writing on a mostly
uninteresting gaggle of a few hundred people.

Except I totally am. Welcome to the tiny village of Sap , tucked into the southwestern corner
â€“ the geographic anus, if you will â€“ of Slovakia. Why bother to write about a
village of 535 people? Was it just so I could coin the phrase â€˜geographic anusâ€™?
Was I hoping I could milk an articleâ€™s worth of laughs out of calling the residents of
Sap a bunch of saps? No, thatâ€™s not even funny once. But this little villageâ€™s
history intrigued me.

It starts with the villageâ€™s original name.



Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Zap.jpg

Okay, thatâ€™s somewhat less than inspiring. The village shows up first on record back
in 1255. A hundred years ago, it was a part of Hungary. This was right before Hungary pulled a
crucial Jenga block from the tower of geographic consistency and caused boundaries to be
redrawn after WWI. Czech soldiers wandered into the little village, and with a wave of the
diplomatic wand, Sap became a part of Czechoslovakia.

    The Treaty of Trianon really messed things up for a lot of Hungarians after the war. Some
    found themselves citizens of Romania, some became Czechs, and others went to the kingdom
    that would come to be known as Yugoslavia. In 1938 the village was given back to Hungary
    just in time for the next war. The Soviets marched in to plant their flag in 1945, then the
    Czechs regained control in 1947. When Czechoslovakia broke up over creative
    differences in 1992, Slovakia grabbed hold of Sap. Read more…

Day 209: The Olympic Junk Drawer





Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Header23.jpg

Unless youâ€™ve spent the last few months bolted to a large slugâ€™s wall,
awaiting a princess disguised as a bounty hunter to liberate you from your carbonite
enclosure, you are probably aware that the 2012 Olympics are kicking off today in London.

Iâ€™m not sure if Ms. Wikiâ€™s Random Article button is bursting with global pride
or merely a slave to the happy chuckle of coincidence, but she invited me to check out the
results for softball at the 2008 Beijing Games this morning. I was impressed; after winning
gold in three consecutive Olympics, the Americans were upset by Japan by a score of 3-1 in the
gold-medal game. I hope the two teams meet again this year for a thrilling revenge match.

Except they wonâ€™t. Softball was dropped from Olympic competition and wonâ€™t
be played in London. This is a shame, because that means we wonâ€™t get to see the
high-speed skills of Jennie Finch, and she was truly an inspiring pitcher.

Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JennieFinch.jpg

I’m inspired.

Media coverage will no doubt drench you in stories and statistics for every sport offering a
juicy gold medal to its champion this year. Iâ€™m going to follow Wikipediaâ€™s
advice and have a look at some former Olympic events for which athletes sacrificed and
struggled their entire lives to achieve world dominance. Sports that, for the next two and a
half weeks, donâ€™t officially matter.



Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TugOfWar.jpg

    So many Olympic sports are centered on pure speed. A few, like weightlifting and â€“
    if they accept my application â€“ manatee-dragging, are all about brute strength.
    Between 1900 and 1920 strength was embodied by the manly game of Tug of War. Read more…

Day 203: The Skies Light Up Over China – The Flying Tigers’ Story





Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Header17.jpg

Inside that gristly cloud prior to an imminent war, men have been known to indulge in some
strange undertakings. Those iron-grey months before the Japanese squirted their rage onto
the US Navy base at Pearl Harbor carried the distant flugel-blasts of impending battle, and
for a group of American servicemen, this meant acting, not waiting.



Image:
http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ClaireChennault.jpg

Colonel Claire L. Chennault, whose jawline could cut through the air and cause it to shriek in
agony, had been working in China since 1937 as the director of a Chinese Air Force flight
school. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, not liking his armyâ€™s chances against a
hungry Japanese empire, called up Chennault and asked him if heâ€™d use some pull to snag
a little American support for their cause.

The Americans were doing their best to stay out of the mess in the Far East, but FDR was tuned in.
He knew that a Day of Infamy was very likely on the horizon, so in 1940 he (allegedly) gave the
okay for Chennault to scoop up some volunteers and head over to China to provide some air
support. Unofficially, of course.

Chennault spent that winter securing the purchase of 100 Curtiss P-40 fighter planes, the
recruitment of 100 pilots, 200 ground crew personnel and a workable office staff. And so was
born the 1 st American Volunteer Group, also known as the Flying Tigers .



Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/1stAVC.jpg

    Youâ€™ve heard of a rag-tag group â€“ these guys aspired to reach that level.
    60 pilots joined up from the Navy and Marine Corps, another 40 from the Air Force. The
    problem was, a lot of these pilots were a lot less qualified than theyâ€™d claimed to
    be. Some had claimed combat experience but really had only flown bombers. Some had flown
    even less-powerful planes. One or two had only ever actually flown a kite. Read more…

Day 124: Where Hell Froze Over – Ellef Ringnes Island





Image:
http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/InsideStation-300x187.jpg

Todayâ€™s challenge is to write a thousand words about an uninhabited slab of land that
almost nobody wants to visit and even the gods seem to hate. For this task Ms. Wiki has deserted
me upon Ellef Ringnes Island , located in the northwestern quadrant of that hideous near-dead
tundra of the Canadian arctic.

With over 4300 square miles of grey desolation, Ellef Ringnes is the 69 th largest island in the
world, just a smidge larger than Jamaica. That said, itâ€™s not the size of the island
that counts, but rather what you can do with it. The answer here is â€œnot muchâ€�.

The total confirmed flora on the island includes 49 species of moss and about 85 types of
fungus. Youâ€™ll see the occasional muskox, caribou and polar bear living (somehow)
among all this nothingness, but not much more. Ten species of mammals and fifteen types of
birds have been spotted here. Thatâ€™s it. One of those mammal species was â€“ at
one time â€“ humans. More on that below.

A pair of Norwegian explorers were first to chart the island back in 1901. They named the island
after Norwegian entrepreneur Ellef Ringnes, possibly because he financed their
expedition, or maybe because he was a successful Norwegian brewer, and they thought they
could score some free beer by naming an island after him.

Image:
http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/StationToday1-300x187.jpg

Even if it was a hell-hole.

Â Because this was a Norwegian discovery, that nation held a territorial claim on the
deserted slab of rock until 1930, when it was passed over to Canada. When the second World War
came to an end a High Arctic Weather Station was installed as a joint Canada-US venture on the
west coast of the island.

    This was a lucky break for eight science-y hermits who yearned to get away from
    civilization. The down-side was that theyâ€™d be stuck there together. It could
    have been a sitcom â€“ like Gilliganâ€™s Island, except with rotten weather,
    no goofy shenanigans, and everyone is the Professor. Read more…

Day 108: This Much Is True – The Story Of Spandau Prison





Image:
http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Spandau-300x219.jpg

In 1876, the Germans completed construction on Spandau Prison , designed to hold up to 600
prisoners. It was a brick fortress, surrounded by a 15-foot wall, then a 30-foot wall, then a
10-foot wall topped with electrified wire, and lastly a wall of barbed wire.

In 1946, due to some notable misbehavior over the previous 13 years, Germany lost control of
Spandau Prison, and it was turned over to the occupying Allied forces for use as a place to stash
Nazi war criminals. The four nations in charge, the Soviets, the Americans, the British, and
the French, took monthly turns overseeing the prison. At any given time, there were about
sixty soldiers on duty, teams of civilian warders, four prison directors, their deputies,
medical officers, translators, cooks, waiters, and probably a tennis pro on staff.

There were seven prisoners.

On July 18, 1947, the prisoners were brought to Spandau and numbered off:



Image:
http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BaldurVonSchirach-204x300.jpg

Prisoner #1, Baldur von Schirach. Leader of the Hitler Youth and alleged bisexual. He was one
of only two men on trial at the Nuremberg hearings to denounce Hitler, claiming heâ€™d
been ignorant of the extermination camps, and he provided evidence that he registered a
complaint about the inhuman treatment of the Jews. Sentence: 20 years.



Image:
http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ErichRaeder-196x300.jpg

Prisoner #2, Erich Raeder. Grand Admiral, the highest rank in the German Navy. He wanted to
invade Norway, but was voted down by his staff. After a handful of screw-ups, he was demoted in
1943. He resigned, but was convicted for waging a war of aggression. Sentence: Life.



Image:
http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/KonstantinVonNeurath-229x300.jpg

    Prisoner #3, Konstantin von Neurath. German foreign minister at the start of
    Hitlerâ€™s reign, but he lacked the cajones to live up to Hitlerâ€™s standard
    of asshole-ness. Hitler fired him in 1938, but his actions during his tenure were enough
    to get a conviction. Sentence: 15 years. Read more…
