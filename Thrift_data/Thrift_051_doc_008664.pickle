Alexandre Dumas P\xc3\x83\xc5\xa1re\'s (The Father\'s) adaptation of the original story - &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot; by E.T.A. Hoffmann - was set to music by Tchaikovsky. The ballet was first choreographed by The French Dancer and Teacher, Marius Petipa, and was commissioned by the director of the Russian Imperial Theatres, Ivan Vsevolozhsky, in 1891.\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b> The music for the Nutcracker ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, was composed in 1891\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c92. </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        To give you a sense of where this great work of Ballet Theatre Art sits in all our families\' time scales, and our country\'s time scale, consider this: Chic\'s Grandfather Leon Bramson was about 26 years old when Nutcracker was first performed in Russia. The United States Civil War had concluded 26 years before the ballet was commissioned. In just 17 more years, on September 27th, 1908, Model T Ford\'s, Tin Lizzie\'s, would start rolling off the assembly lines in Detroit. So in a very real sense, this ballet was born and grew up with our families, and with our automobiles. The Nutcracker Ballet really became popular in this country starting in the nineteen sixties. That\'s when your parents - if you are a young ballet student - were not much older than you are now. Or something like that.\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b> In Western countries, this ballet has become perhaps the most popular ballet of all time, and is performed primarily around Christmas and Hannukah time.</b>\n    </p>\n    <b> </b>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <br clear="none"></br>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <font color="#FF69B4" size="+1">\n          <u>\n            Here\'s A Brief Summary Of The Nutcracker Story.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            It\'s Also Called A Synopsis of The Story\n          </u>\n        </font>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <b> </b>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <font color="#FF69B4">\n          This particular synopsis appeared in the Boston Ballet Company\'s Nutcracker flyer we bought in the lobby in 1994.

The curtain opens to reveal the Silberhaus\' house, where a Christmas Eve party is under way. Clara, her little brother Fritz, and their mother and father are celebrating with friends and family, when the mysterious godfather, Herr Drosselmeyer, enters. He quickly produces a large bag of gifts for all the children. All are very happy, except for Clara, who has yet to be presented a gift. Herr Drosselmeyer, who is a highly skilled clock and toy maker, then produces two life-size dolls, Columbine and Harlequin, which each take a turn to dance. They are two of the standard characters from the traditional Italian comic puppet shows known as Comedia Dell Art\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9.

Clara has been shrinking. She wakes up and tries to run away, but the mice stop her. Alternatively, perhaps Clara is still in a dream: the Christmas tree suddenly begins to grow to enormous size, filling the room. It\'s really Clara who is shrinking.

In another version, she goes up in a balloon, and the dream never ends. In Balanchine\'s version also, she is never shown waking up; instead, after all the dances in the Kingdom of Sweets have concluded, she rides off with the Nutcracker/Prince on a Santa Claus type Flying Sleigh, complete with Reindeer, and the curtain falls. This gives the impression that the &quot;dream&quot; actually happens in reality, as in Hoffmann\'s original story. The 1985 Royal Ballet version seems to imply the same thing, since at the end, Drosselmeyer\'s nephew, who had really been transformed into a Nutcracker, reappears in human form at the toymaker\'s shop.)\n          </font>\n        </b>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <b>\n      <b> </b>\n    </b>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <b> </b>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <b>\n          <br clear="none"></br>\n          <font color="#FF69B4" size="+1">\n            <u>A Lovely Moment - Or Who Danced With Us In the Boston Ballet?</u>\n          </font>\n        </b>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <b>\n          <font color="#FF69B4">\n            A lovely moment happened in our lobby, recently, which I want to share with you.

Petipa had choreographed two other ballets you may know of: Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake, and had worked with Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky before. So it was only natural that he should ask Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to compose the music for The Nutcracker.  Petipa gave Tchaikovsky specific instructions to write a march, a Chinese dance, an Arabian dance, a Russian dance, and so forth.\n        </b>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <b>\n          Today, most choreographers design dances to music that is already composed, but in the last century, ballet music was usually \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93ordered\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd by choreographers, with instructions to write so many measures of music with a specific rhythm and tempo, and so many measures of another rhythm and tempo.

we will be dancing there sooner than you think. And, I have been uncharacteristically interested in the entire &quot;Nutcracker Score,&quot; rather than my usual obsessing about &quot;Snow&quot;, &quot;Spanish&quot;, or &quot;The Waltz of the Flowers.&quot;\n          </font>\n          <font color="ff77cc">I have also accumulated over the years many &quot;Nutracker&quot; musical excerpts and/or complete CD sets by different orchestras, different conductors, variations on a theme of &quot;Nutcracker&quot; by Moe, Larry &amp; Curly, and the Techno Twins. </font>\n          <font color="#ff60ff">\n            Just kidding, but you know what I mean. Admit it. Sometimes it is hard to delight in the sweet beauty of the Tchaikovsky score when media commercials with musak renditions of &quot;Trepak&quot; or &quot;Marzipan&quot;, chopped and buchered, are already appearing in shiny, sparkly, riculously unrealistic ads by Halloween.  It is easy to become a little jaded, cynical, and bored when it comes to the commercialization of one of the most successful dance phenomena of all time.\n          </font>\n        </b>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <b>\n          <font color="#ff77ee">\n            Instead, I find myself completely in the mood for Nutcracker.  In fact, in last night\'s Barre, I used ONLY Nutcracker music, something I have never ever done before.  It was so much fun!

Ivanov had already won acclaim for his choreography for parts of Swan Lake. (Petipa did the two acts that take place in a palace, and Ivanov did the two acts that take place at the lake, with dancers playing the parts of swans.) In The Nutcracker, Ivanov was limited by the story of the first act to traditional choreography, but when Clara travels to the Land of Snows, Ivanov was able to introduce a new type of movement, turning dancers into snowflakes, as he had earlier turned dancers into swans. Similarly, in the Land of Sweets, Ivanov made each dance characteristic of the nationality of the dancers (Spanish, Russian, and Chinese) or type of sweets (for example, big, swirling movements for the flowers, and quick, tiny steps for the Sugar Plum Fairy).\n    </b>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        The ballet was conducted by\n        <a title="Riccardo Drigo" href="/wiki/Riccardo_Drigo" shape="rect">Riccardo Drigo</a>\n        , with\n        <a title="Antoinetta Dell-Era (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antoinetta_Dell-Era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" shape="rect">Antoinetta Dell-Era</a>\n        as the Sugar Plum Fairy,\n        <a title="Pavel Gerdt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org&quot;/wiki/Pavel_Gerdt&quot;" shape="rect">Pavel Gerdt</a>\n        as Prince Coqueluche, Stanislava Belinskaya as Clara, Sergei Legat as the Nutcracker-Prince, and Timofei Stukolkin as Drosselmeyer.\n        <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">\n          <a title="" href="#cite_note-1" shape="rect">\n            <span>[</span>\n            2\n            <span>]</span>\n          </a>\n        </sup>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <b> </b>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <b>In other countries</b>\n        <br clear="none"></br>\n        An abridged version of the ballet was first performed outside Russia in Budapest (Royal Opera House) in 1927, with choreography by Ede Brada.\n        <sup class="noprint Template-Fact">\n          <span style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources\xc2\xa0since November 2008">\n            [\n            <i>\n              <a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" shape="rect">citation needed</a>\n            </i>\n            ]\n          </span>\n        </sup>\n        The first complete performance of the ballet outside Russia took place in England in 1934.\n        <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference">\n          <a title="" href="#cite_note-2" shape="rect">\n            <span>[</span>\n            3\n            <span>]</span>\n          </a>\n        </sup>\n        Its first complete United States performance was in 1944, by the\n        <a title="San Francisco Ballet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Ballet" shape="rect">San Francisco Ballet</a>\n        , staged by its artistic director\n        <a title="Willam Christensen" href="/wiki/Willam_Christensen" shape="rect">Willam Christensen</a>\n        .\n        <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">\n          <a title="" href="#cite_note-3" shape="rect">\n            <span>[</span>\n            4\n            <span>]</span>\n          </a>\n        </sup>\n        The\n        <a title="New York City Ballet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Ballet" shape="rect">New York City Ballet</a>\n        first performed\n        <a title="George Balanchine" href="/wiki/George_Balanchine" shape="rect">George Balanchine</a>\n        \'s staging of\n        <i>The Nutcracker</i>\n        in 1954.\n        <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">\n          <a title="" href="#cite_note-4" shape="rect">\n            <span>[</span>\n            5\n            <span>]</span>\n          </a>\n        </sup>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <b> </b>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <br clear="none"></br>\n        <a name="New_choreography" id="New_choreography" shape="rect"></a>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <b> </b>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <font color="#FF69B4" size="+1">\n          <u>New choreography</u>\n        </font>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <font color="#FF69B4"> </font>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        <b>Willam Christensen</b>\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <b> </b>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        It was not until 1944 that the first complete production in the U.S. took place, performed by the\n        <a title="San Francisco Ballet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Ballet" shape="rect">San Francisco Ballet</a>\n        , and choreographed by\n        <a title="Willam Christensen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willam_Christensen" shape="rect">Willam Christensen</a>\n        .

Here is the review by By Marcia B. Siegel, December 19, 2008.\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        &quot;Ballet Rox\'s Urban Nutcracker, the ultimate multicultural Christmas celebration, has become so inclusive, it\'s almost a blur. The cultural identities are mostly intact, but there\'s so much going on around them that you can lose track of the reason they\'re all on the same stage together. Maybe it doesn\'t matter. The show, at John Hancock Hall through 21 December, is a lot of fun, and it takes its highbrow heritage with a bucket of salt.&quot;\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        &quot;Artistic director Anthony Williams and scenarist David Ira Rottenberg have set the traditional Nutcracker story in the home of a present-day extended family, and the Tchaikovsky score is spiked with its Duke Ellington counterpart. The slim plot follows the standard script. After the excitement of the party, Clarice dreams of a mouse invasion, toys coming to life, snowflakes in toe shoes, and then a string of dancing confections, all prompted by the magic of an avuncular Drosselmeyer.&quot;\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        Marcia Siegel continues: &quot;Like other Nutcracker productions, this one has a street full of civilians to set the scene. Swarms of teenagers with their ringleaders strut onto the turf: a team of double-dutch experts, five Irish stepdancers led by Brendan O\'Brien, eight tapdancers led by Sean Fielder, and two moonwalking poppers (twins Billy and Bob McClain) who can move each body part separately like mechanical dolls and can make their red satin shirts ripple by \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d how else? \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d energizing their skin.\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        These rowdy clans interact in challenge dances and boogie along with whoever\'s doing a solo. They make way for a quartet of cool seniors (Ilanga, Christian Scott, Gilbert White, and John Wyche) who sing doo-wop oldies. Amid the throngs, Clarice (Rebecca Paul), her mom (Melodie Jeffery Cassell), and bratty brother Omar (Nolan Jones) meet up with Drosselmeyer and his assistant Mini-Meyer (Michael Shannon and Yo-el Cassell) and invite them home to entertain the family\'s guests.\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        The party is hardly less chaotic, even without the rope jumpers and rhythm-dance groups. There\'s lots of hugging and agitated rushing around. Grandfather (Gilbert White) stands in for an absent dad. Mini-Meyer, a character whose hyperactive syndrome seems to have gotten much worse since the last time I saw the show, keeps the room at a constant buzz. A tipsy aunt (Natalie VanLandingham) pins him down on the sofa with a kiss, but that\'s the only time his fidgets let up.\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        Finally I settled down to enjoy the inspired zaniness, like the battle between the picnicking mice and the girl prizefighters on pointe. I appreciated the physicality of the real contact and choreographed acrobatics when the Mouse King (Gary Vaughn) duels with the Nutcracker (Langston Fishburne). And the snowstorm seemed almost restful, with only the dancers whirling, leaping, and stepping smoothly in organized patterns.\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        In the second act, Clarice meets the Sugar Plum Fairy (Autumn Hill Friday night, with partner Philip Ingrassia), whose classical routine incorporates Ellington-esque jazzy shrugs and discreet bounces that she teaches to three young disciples. The &quot;Sweets&quot; divertissements proceed as usual, with local flavorings. My favorite was the four fleshy Spanish ladies, who did a terrific skirt dance to accompany a bland ballerina (Olga Marchenko) in &quot;Ritmo Latino.&quot; Rick Vigo led his hula-hoop virtuosos in the &quot;Candy Cane&quot; variation, and Erin Washington and Sean Fielder supervised a bunch of tiny tappers in &quot;Mother Ginger.&quot; Breakdancers sparred with Russian folk dancers in &quot;Caviar Caper.&quot; Branchette Janelle Gilchrist did campy ballet to Ellington\'s &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot; in swingtime, and six little girls shepherded by Marzipan Meredith Baer bounced in fine precision on blue-and-yellow polka-dot beach balls.&quot;\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>\n        The review concludes...\n        <br clear="none"></br>\n        &quot;I wouldn\'t say this Nutcracker features the sustained choreographic challenge that the traditional work can put to its hordes of children. What it does have is energy and enterprise, and heart. After Sugar Plum\'s farewell, Clarice, asleep on the sofa, is awakened from her dream by her Father, who\'s home in uniform from Iraq \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d the sweetest present of all.&quot;\n      </b>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b> I enjoyed the review, and knowing Tony, his production should not be missed!
