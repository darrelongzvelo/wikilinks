[ edit ] Collaborative research



In addition to internal research and development activities Novartis is also involved in
publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic
partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox . [
11 ] [ 12 ] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the
framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission . [ 13 ]

[ edit ] History

Novartis headquarters in Basel

Novartis was created in 1996 from the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz Laboratories , both
Swiss companies with long histories. Ciba-Geigy was formed in 1970 by the merger of J. R. Geigy
Ltd (founded in Basel in 1758) and Ciba (founded in Basel in 1859). Combining the histories of
the merger partners, the company's effective history spans 250 years. [ 14 ]

[ edit ] Ciba-Geigy



Johann Rudolf Geigy-Gemuseus (1733â€“1793) began trading in 1758 in "materials,
chemicals, dyes and drugs of all kinds" [ 15 ] in Basel , Switzerland . Johann Rudolf
Geigy-Merian (1830â€“1917) and Johann Muller-Pack acquired a site in Basel in 1857,
where they built a dyewood mill and a dye extraction plant. Two years later, they began the
production of synthetic fuchsine . In 1901, they formed the public limited company Geigy and
the name of the company was changed to J. R. Geigy Ltd in 1914.

In 1859 Alexander Clavel (1805 â€“ 1873) took up the production of fuchsine in his
factory for silk -dyeing works in Basel. In 1864, a new site for the production of synthetic
dyes was constructed, and in 1873, Clavel sold his dye factory to the new company Bindschedler
& Busch . In 1884 Bindschedler & Busch is transformed into a joint-stock company with the name
"Gesellschaft fÃŒr Chemische Industrie Basel" (Company for Chemical Industry Basel).
The abbreviation Ciba was adopted as the company's name in 1945.

In 1925 J. R. Geigy Ltd. began producing textile auxiliaries, [ clarification needed ] an
activity which Ciba took up in 1928.

In 1939, Geigy chemist Paul Hermann MÃŒller discovered that DDT was effective against
malaria-bearing insects. He received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work in 1948.

Ciba and Geigy merged in 1971 to form Ciba-Geigy Ltd. . This company merged with Sandoz in 1996,
with the pharmaceutical divisions staying together to form Novartis, and other Ciba-Geigy
businesses spun off as independent companies.

[ edit ] Sandoz



The Chemiefirma Kern & Sandoz ("Kern & Sandoz Chemistry Firm") was founded in 1886 by Dr.
Alfred Kern (1850â€“1893) and Edouard Sandoz (1853â€“1928). The first dyes
manufactured there were alizarine blue and auramine . After Kern's death, the partnership
became the corporation Chemische Fabrik vormals Sandoz in 1895. The company began producing
the fever-reducing drug antipyrin in the same year. Further pharmaceutical research began
in 1917 under Professor Arthur Stoll (1887â€“1971). In 1899, the company began
producing the sugar substitute saccharin .

Between the World Wars, Gynergen (1921) and Calcium-Sandoz (1929) were brought to market.
Sandoz also produced chemicals for textiles , paper , and leather , beginning in 1929. In 1939,
they began producing agricultural chemicals.

In 2005, Sandoz expanded significantly though the acquisition of Hexal , one of Germany's
leading generic drug companies, and Eon Labs , a fast-growing US generic pharmaceutical
company.

The psychedelic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were discovered at the Sandoz
laboratories in 1943 by Albert Hofmann . Sandoz began clinical trials, and marketed the
substance, from 1947 through the mid 1960s, under the name Delysid as a psychiatric drug,
thought useful for treating a wide variety of mental ailments , from alcoholism to sexual
deviancy . Sandoz suggested in its literature that psychiatrists take LSD themselves, [ 16 ]
to gain a better subjective understanding of the schizophrenic experience, and many did
exactly that. For several years, the psychedelic drugs were also called " psychotomimetic "
because they were thought to mimic psychosis . Later research caused this term to be
abandoned, as neuroscientists gained a better understanding of psychoses, including
schizophrenia. Research on LSD peaked in the 1950s and early 1960s. Sandoz withdrew the drug
from the market in the mid 1960s.

Sandoz opened its first foreign offices in 1964.

In 1967, Sandoz merged with Wander AG (known for Ovomaltine and Isostar ). Sandoz acquired the
companies Delmark , WasabrÃ¶d (a Swedish manufacturer of crisp bread ), and Gerber
Products Company (a baby food company).

On 1 November 1986, a fire broke out in a production plant storage room, which led to a large
amount of pesticide being released into the upper Rhine river. This exposure killed many fish
and other aquatic life.

In 1995, Sandoz spun off its speciality chemicals business to form Clariant . Subsequently,
in 1997, Clariant merged with the speciality chemicals business that was spun off from
Hoechst AG in Germany .

"Sandoz" continues as a Novartis generic drug brand (see below for details) .

[ edit ] After the merger

Suffern, New York : the sole Novartis pharmaceutical production facility in the United
States.

After the merger, Novartis reorganized its activities, and spun out its chemicals
activities as Ciba Specialty Chemicals (now a part of BASF ).

In 1998 the company made headlines with its biotechnology licensing agreement with the UC
Berkeley Department of Plant and Microbial Biology . Critics of the agreement expressed
concern over prospects that the agreement would diminish academic objectivity, or lead to
the commercialization of genetically modified plants. The agreement expired in 2003.

Novartis combined its agricultural division with that of AstraZeneca to create Syngenta in
November 2000.

In 2003, Novartis created a new company named Sandoz , a subsidiary that bundles its generic
drug production, reusing the predecessor brand. [ 17 ]

On 20 April 2006, Novartis acquired the California-based Chiron Corporation . Chiron was
formerly divided into three units: Chiron Vaccines and Chiron Blood Testing, which now
combine to form Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, and Chiron BioPharmaceuticals, to be
integrated into Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

The ongoing Basel Campus Project has the aim to transform the St. Johann site - Novartis
headquarters in Basel - "from an industrial complex to a place of innovation, knowledge and
encounter". [ 18 ]

In 2005, Novartis introduced Certican ( Everolimus ), an immunosuppressant, and in October
2006 began marketing Telbivudine , a new antiviral drug for hepatitis B .

On 12 October 2009, Novartis has entered into an agreement for exclusive US and Canadian
rights to Fanapt(iloperidone), a new oral medication that is approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of adults with schizophrenia. [ 19 ]

On 6 November 2009, Novartis reached an agreement to acquire an 85% stake in the Chinese
vaccines company Zhejiang Tianyuan Bio-Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. as part of a strategic
initiative to build a vaccines industry leader in this country and expand the Group's limited
presence in this fast-growing market segment. This proposed acquisition will require
government and regulatory approvals in China. [ 20 ]

On 4 January 2010, Novartis offered to pay US $39.3 billion to fully acquire Alcon , the
worldâ€™s largest eye-care company, including a majority stake held by NestlÃ© .
Novartis had bought 25% of Alcon in 2008. [ 21 ]

[ edit ] Controversies and criticism



[ edit ] Challenge to India's patent laws



In 2006, Novartis launched a court case against India seeking to prohibit the country from
developing generic drugs based on patented medicines . [ 24 ] Novartis had challenged a law
that allows India to refuse to recognize a patent for an existing medicine if there is a
modified formula resulting in a re-patent of the drug. [ 25 ] On August 5, 2007 an Indian court in
Chennai ruled against Novartis saying that, "Novartisâ€™ legal challenge - mounted to
limit competition to its own patented medicines - was a threat to people suffering from cancer
, HIV and AIDS , diabetes and other diseases who are too poor to pay for them." [ 26 ] The high court
also claimed to have no jurisdiction on whether Indian Patent law complied with WTO patent
guidelines.

In the months leading up to the hearing, over half a million people wrote to the CEO of Novartis
expressing their opposition to the suit. Novartis has decided not to appeal the ruling. [ 27 ]

[ edit ] Advertising practices



In September 2008 the FDA sent a notice to Novartis Pharmaceuticals regarding its
advertising of Focalin XR, an ADHD drug, in which they overstated its efficacy. [ 28 ]

[ edit ] 'No' to free flu vaccines



In June 2009, Novartis declined to provide a donation to the poor of vaccines to counter the
latest flu pandemic, saying developing nations or donor nations should cover the costs.
Daniel Vasella, Novartis chief executive, told the Financial Times that he would consider
offering discounted pricing to low-income nations, but unlike GlaxoSmithKline , would not
offer vaccines for free. [ 29 ]

[ edit ] Sexual discrimination



On May 17, 2010, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
awarded $3,367,250 in compensatory damages against Novartis, finding that the company had
committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and
entry-level managers since 2002, in matters of pay, promotion, and treatment after learning
that the employees were pregnant . Two days later (the trial was bifurcated so that the
punitive damages verdict was argued and deliberated separately), the jury awarded punitive
damages in the amount of $250 million, representing about 2 percent of Novartis' gross
revenues for 2009. Normally punitive damages would be reduced to less than a 10-1 ratio, but
the trial was actually for a group of named plaintiffs in a class action , who were representing
a class of 5,600 class members. The jury was instructed to award compensatory damages just to
the named plaintiffs, but to award punitive damages to the entire class. Once the court makes
findings on compensatory damages for the remaining class members (which are estimated by
plaintiffs' counsel at just under $1 billion), the $250 million is expected to satisfy the
Supreme Court's single-digit ratio test for proportionality of compensatory to punitive
damages. [ 30 ]
