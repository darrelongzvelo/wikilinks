I realize even the most popular sports in one part of the world are unknown in another. But I'm
generally looking for, say, the best female badminton player ever or the greatest Buzkashi
champion, as opposed to, say, Michael Jordan.

"Bradman's Test batting average of 99.94 has become one of cricket's most famous, iconic

I came here to say Don Bradman. (Oddly enough, I only know about him through reading about G. H.

see his New York Times obituary for some examples.

Something about competitive cycling seems to attract exceptional characters. I nominate
Mick Murphy, legend of The RÃ¡s Tailteann (an 8 day cycle race in Ireland).



He is conscious of the benefits of a good diet when in training, and maintains that this
knowledge helped him in his cycling days: "raw foods are best - meat, eggs, cheese,
vegetables, honey - and I always took quantities of cows' blood when I felt it was needed."



An amazing interview is linked from Jack Thurston's blog here .

I'll see your Jehangir and Janshir Khans and raise you Heather McKay , the greatest female
squash player ever and arguably the most dominant athlete in any sport, ever. Among her
accomplishments:



- She went undefeated for 19 years .

- She lost only two matches in her entire career.

- She won the British Open (arguably the world championship) 16 straight times.

- In 1967, she won the world championship final without losing a single point .



Oh, and by the way she also found time and energy to be a member of the Australian Women's Hockey
Team, win the American Amateur Racquetball Championship once, the American Professional
Racquetball Championship three times, and the Canadian Racquetball Championship five
times.

Juan Manuel Fangio was probably the greatest driver ever, though that's up for discussion.
I'll let you decide if muscling that machine around takes more athletic ability than bowling.
Certainly takes more balls to go out there with no seatbelt wearing just a leather hat. Amazing

Likewise, Michele Mouton was the first (and arguably only) really competitive female
driver, during the insane years of Group B rallying at that. The cars got so fast that they were
difficult to control and the series eventually was canceled. Decent video .

Emil ZÃ¡topek is my favorite relatively forgotten athlete, although not obscure. "His
final [Olympic Gold] medal came when he decided at the last minute to compete in the marathon
for the first time in his life, and won. His strategy for the marathon was simple: he raced
alongside Jim Peters, the British world-record holder. After a punishing first fifteen
kilometers in which Peters knew he had overtaxed himself, Zatopek asked the Englishman what
he thought of the race thus far. The astonished Peters told the Czech that the pace was "too
slow," at which point Zatopek simply accelerated. Peters never finished; Zatopek ran an
Olympic record race."

Lance Mackey, the musher from Fairbanks who in 2007 did what even the toughest of the

Ok, since others have mentioned ski jumpers:



Jan BoklÃ¶v , Swedish ski jumper who invented the V-style in 1985. It was a huge controversy
at first, and he always got style point deductions for the first few years of jumping that way.
But he was able to jump about 10% further with his new style, which has since replaced the
"Daescher technique" as the predominant ski-jumping technique. (Personal video of a
V-style jumper here .)

Eric Heiden is the greatest long track speed skater of all time. His sweep of all the long track
races (500, 1000, 1500, 5000 and 10000 meters) at the 1980 Olympics has never been repeated. He
also set Olympic or world records during each performance.



Vasiliy Alekseyev is one of the greatest weightlifters to have ever lived, and the most
accomplished super heavyweight lifter of all time, setting 80 world records in his career.



Kenenisa Bekele is probably the greatest middle distance runner of all time. He is the world
and Olympic record holder in the 5000 and 10000 meters and most accomplished cross country
runner of all time. What really sets him apart is his ability to run the last 400m of a race 11-12
seconds off world record pace for the 400m.
