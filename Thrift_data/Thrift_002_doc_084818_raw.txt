A day with Stella…



Jun 14

Posted by carlos



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0428.jpg?w=389&h=293

Yesterday was a day set to explore Los Angeles with Stella, she is visiting from Brazil. After I
picked her up we manage to get stuck in a typical L.A. traffic jam (a good way to get to know L.A.).
After waiting and moving inches in downtown L.A. traffic…I decided to do some spinning on
the road and we crossed the city via surface street. We headed to the Getty Center…where I was
expecting to give her a good view of the city…she could see the 405 freeway looking like a
parking lot…and also the smog that we are having these days…due to the intense heat.



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0422.jpg?w=387&h=292

At the Getty Center, the first thing we did was lunch at the restaurant, Stella was famished. We
finished our lunch with the most delicious coffee (the coffee was perfect). Then we headed
toward the photography art exhibition. The Getty is showing : “ A Place in the Sun-
Photographs of Los Angeles by John Humble “. It was quite fascinating seeing urban
landscaping pictures of Los Angeles from the 70s and beyond. Various pictures of the L.A.
River and its tragic polluted path got my attention, beautifully captured. Also part of the
photo collection, we can see the typical outdoor-signs that is part of L.A. identity and
culture. But the reason that I wanted to take Estela to the Getty Center, was the garden.





Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0429.jpg?w=479&h=361



And it was at the garden that we had the most fun. The garden is in full bloom and the bees were
having a ball. The Getty Center had been open for over 9 years and I remember the early years when
everything seemed so placed, extremely manicured, even the pebbles seemed to be allocated to
perfection. Today we can encounter the place with some signs of aging, time is taking its tool.
But it is still a great place that I always enjoy a quick visit.





Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0432.jpg?w=478&h=359

We were in love with the poppies, the sun was heating them full power, and they had a sort of
translucency on the petals.





Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0435.jpg?w=437&h=323

 



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0442.jpg?w=424&h=360

Somehow we kept following the bees…and I managed to capture this one on photo. The bees were
having a feast at the Getty Center garden.

Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0445.jpg?w=479&h=300

I love the beauty, hues, shades and texture we find in nature.

Later…I took her to a place…that usually makes any woman happy… the shopping mall!

Gay Pride Celebration 2007 (West Hollywood)



Jun 10

Posted by carlos



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/carlosjackie.jpg?w=604

What a fantastic energy flowing in this day. And so the parade came…and so it went. We walked
down Santa Monica Blvd, part of the NBC-Universal(GE) – Out@NBCU. The group was led by
American Fitness Trainer Jackie Warner (from: Bravo reality TV-show “ Work Out “) and
Anthony Morrison (from Bravo reality show “ Shear Genius “). They opened the group
sitting on a classic pink convertible, followed by us holding pom-poms that resembled the
colors of NBC peacock logo, but also in reference to the colors of the rainbow that embodies the
gay pride flag.



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/meuli.jpg?w=604

Bula was orchestrating all the arrangements with the rest of the coordinating committee,
making sure the balloons were attached to the VIP-trolley that the company allowed the
out@nbcu to have as part f the festivities. It was over 121 floats or groups on the parade, and we
were number 102. We did stand around and waited, talked and gossip, plus we survived the
waiting by drinking lots of water. The day started gray but the sun later was in full power mode,
a perfect weather, nice and warm, with lots of friendly people everywhere along the event.





Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/police.jpg?w=232&h=309







Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/pinkme.jpg?w=387&h=303

 

And the police was sporting a very cool vehicle checking and making sure everything was
running smoothly, and appears that they succeeded from my angle. I also came across a very
interesting women, dress in pastel pink head to toe, with her sweet little doggy that reminded
me of “Doris Day” pillow talk movie, and once she heard me say that to someone I was talking
to, she turned around and we were posing for photos.





Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/jackieanthony.jpg?w=604

And in the end we were all feeling rewarded from being part of the celebration, some headed to
“ The Abbey “ for drinks, some to the festival and some headed home…all I want was a nice
cold ice-water and a soothing bath! Definitely worth it!

Happy Gay Pride – 2007!



Jun 10

Posted by carlos

And here we are once again celebrating Gay Pride. I never been to the gay parade in L.A., every
year that I have tried to watch or attend the festivities, the parking and traffic seemed so
intense that I drove back home. When I used to live in Studio City, I thought that we would just
drive over the hill and we would be there…in the middle of the festivities, not exactly! When
we got there it was packed, and we took more time sitting on the car trying to find a way to return
home. This year it will be different! This year I will be in the parade itself, so I am waking-up
early to be there…I got my shades to deal with the sun, but the day is starting gray and cool.
Two years ago, the Grand Marshall was Paris Hilton, today she is in jail, ironic and extremely
L.A culture-style. But this year will be John Amaechi , that personally I think is more fitted
to our community. For me an issue that is very important is Gay-Marriage, I strong believe in
the right to get married as a gay person. I dream of the day that it will become a reality. I
believe will impact gay life and gay relationships. But the fight for the right of
Gay-Marriage is not simply a desire by the gay community, it is part of our history and the
discrimination we all have endure, specially during the first AIDS-epidemic years. So many
gay couples had the doors shut on their faces…simply because our legal-government system
did not recognize the union of same sex couples, being in my believe the reason for the creation
of domestic-partnerships. For more info on “ LA Pride ” just visit their site! Have fun
everyone!

Women in Art…



Jun 9

Posted by carlos

I come across this video by surfing other blogs; I found it quite interesting . Women had been
the favorite subject by artists throughout history to manifest an idea, a victory, a virtue,
glory, splendor, sorrows, love and all the others human-emotions. It is even said that the
choice to use women in art as the main subject, it is another form of exploitation of women and
their bodies. Barbara Kruger has a famous piece that the words: “ Your gaze hits the side of my
face ” (Untitled- 1981/83), are printed on-top of an black and white image of a female
head-sculpture done in a classical style. Kruger question the freedom that men feel in
regards to the female body, but also she brings to light violence and spouse abuse. In society
there are social unspoken norms in regards to looking, staring or gazing, but men feel the
liberty to look at women, with an unapologetic way, simply because men feel the entitlement.
The female body had turned into an advertising billboard, a product and a commodity. I did
enjoy the digital manipulation and the transitions of the images on the video below, it brings
the portraiture to life. Enjoy gazing at the video!

What a fun week…



Jun 5

Posted by carlos





Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0219.jpg?w=604

It was a week of a lot of running around, crazy hectic fun. After graduation, it was time to enjoy
the nice spring weather that we are having in L.A. Having friends visiting out of town, it is
always a great excuse to do some sightseeing and museum visits. A place that I developed a taste
for, due specially to its well manicure gardens, is the renovated Getty Villa Malibu . It is a
perfect place to walk around and enjoy a conversation with a good friend. The place is given
attention to various details, from the choice of materials to the arrangement and
composition of the design that embraces the hillside in which it is located, simply a joy to
visit!



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0278.jpg?w=604

After the Getty Villa, we embarked in a museum expedition. We went to LACMA , and we saw the
current exhibitions, but I do not recommend anyone visiting the LACMA lately. The museum and
the facilities is going through a major renovation, and everything is pushed around and not in
good shape. The place looks as it is in an intense renovation period, lots of constructions and
workers pushing stuff around, let’s hope they will do a great job. I do like the LACMA
collections and the various art-shows they produce. But the current, Dan Flavin-A
Retrospective , I left with a headache. The artist medium is fluorescent lights, and to look at
the installations, I felt like I needed sun glasses, a point in one of the galleries…I passed
with my eyes closed…not enjoyable at all. But later we headed to The Geffen Contemporary at
MOCA to see “ Wack! Art and The Feminist Revolution “, and what a show. The place had been
closed for quite some time, and it is the place for art that is forward thinking, holding the
truthful idea of what can be said to be contemporary. The collection come from the 60′s and
the 70′s , but it holds an edge to this day. Videos from Yoko Ono conceptual art, Judy Chicago
paintings (with amazing calligraphy), Eva Hesse amazing compositions that extends beyond
the 2D frame, becoming a 3D sculpture; outstanding artworks from Louise Bourgeois and many
other. I was hoping to see Barbara Kruger artwork in the show, but even thou her art is very
feminist driven, it is post-feminism movement, and the show takes emphasis on that late
60′s early 70′s women artists. Highly recommended! After that…we stop at the Japanese
American Museum for a quick look. I survived the afternoon on a go-lean peanut butter protein
bar!



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/img_0262.jpg?w=604

Then it was party time at Bula’s new place. And Val was there, being the great neighbor and
making sure the boys would not crash and trash the place, and on top of it all, being her pretty
self. I never saw so much wine, vodka and…the most delicious meat balls, smoky and
tender…true homemade by Billy. Abbie was bouncing around around, looking for true
love…I am sure she found some!

Bachelor of Arts- Graduation day!



May 31

Posted by carlos



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/my-professors.jpg?w=604

What a fun day! The Commencements Ceremonies arrived. The picture above it is of my teacher
Prof. Mary Ann Trujillo (animation) and Professor Tim Forcum (abstract painting). Love them
both! They played an important role in my academic life, both had such great influences in
nurturing my skills and inspirations and fantastic motivators of my creativity. I never
missed one of their classes. I will always be grateful for their lessons! It was also great
seeing my senior-project professor Dr. Kim Abeles, she is so kind and optimistic, plus a great
artist. My graphic design professor, Dr. Paula Di Marco was there, sporting a cool cowboy hat.
It was wonderful to have my name announced and walk down the steps of the Oviatt Library and
shake the hands of my professors. CSUN has an incredible faculty, simply excellent…if
anyone is smart enough to realize and take advantage of it.



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/class-of-2007.jpg?w=604

And so we were the class of 2007. The event was noise and fun, the energy was flowing. Everyone
seemed so happy that the mission was accomplished, and it was fun to see everyone once again one
more time. Stephanie, Julia, Blythe, me, Alisa and Foss, we we all very much content and loaded
with joy.



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/img_0213.jpg?w=604

Alisa and I started together…and finished together. We became close friends from day one in
school. Classes together, lunch together and lots of gossip about the strange characters we
used to encounter in campus, kept us going…and surviving! It was fun to have her always by my
side. Another friend for life!



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/img_0214.jpg?w=604

And what a wonderful surprise to be able to hold Blythe’s Hero. She was born last January, and
last semester, I used to rub Blythe’s belly…wondering…what a magnificent gift she was
about to receive. Blythe is a beautiful person…and she has a great soul. It was a great gift to
be able to hold Hero on my arms. Hero is Blythe’s best friend now, I have been demoted.



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/img_0217.jpg?w=604

And the boys were there to give their moral support. Luis came from San Francisco, Ulisses
escaped earlier from Universal, Brent manage to find a way to be there, and Geary was also there
but missing on this picture. Thank you all so much for coming over and being part of this great
day in my life. Later…it was dinner and wine, and now….is resting time! Good night!

Honors Convocation.



May 29

Posted by carlos



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/ano-primario.jpg?w=604

Today is a very special day for me. The little boy is growing up! …I guess! (if that is
possible)

The picture above, it was taken at my first year in school in Brazil, “ 1 Ano Primario” (1st
year at grammar school). Behind me is Goias State flag. The previous year was the fun
kindergarten period, a time that I learned to be away from my family, for the first time. I think
I was 6 years old when this picture was taken. I remember that day very well. I was feeling so tiny
behind that desk, and I remember being impressed and loving the globe to my left. I was feeling
as if I was about to embark into a long journey. I loved going to my grammar school, those were
years of many lessons learned, a boy filled with dreams and hope.

Now, I just finished my “Bachelor of Arts” at California State University-Northridge (
CSUN ), and today is the Honors Convocation, where the president of the university will
present us the honors’ students with some sort of medallion. I am graduating “ Cum Laude
“, a sweet surprise. I guess all the hard work and intense long hours of studying and
researching paid back. I am feeling so anxious and excited. Tomorrow will be the graduation
for all the students in the “Art, Media & Communication Department “. Almost 10,000
students are graduating this semester. Tomorrow I will have the chance to wear my regalia, cap
and gown, with my red-and-white tassel representing my department, I dreamed of this day. For
year I fought the principle of being part of an institution, and today an institution is
presenting me with honors, funny how life works. I worked so hard for this day…and now I will
see where else my path will take me.



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/gandc.jpg?w=604

And so…we headed toward the “Honors Convocation”, my friend Geary came along for moral
support. He had been supportive of my academic life from day one. The ceremony was outdoors, in
front of the “ Oviatt Library “. We arrived early to avoid any madness of parking and
running around, but all went well. It was warm in the valley, around 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and
sitting under the sun waiting for the event to happen took me some patience skills. Patience it
is not one of my virtues, so I talked to some classmates that were around to keep the time going
faster. The ceremony started with a band playing a march for the faculty to enter the center
stage, it sounded more like Mary Queen of Scotland was about to enter. I was not very impressed
with the chosen speaker, she sounded more like she was reading for a “citizenship
ceremony”, instead of an academic achievement event. Also she made many faux -pas, for
example by saying: “ today we students wear our caps and gowns as a symbol of our honorable
achievement “, something like that. The invitations to the event made clear
specifications for us students not to wear the regalia in this event, but only in the
“Commencements Ceremony” that will start tomorrow according to the departments. Then
we started the line of students to enter the stage, I was part of the early group, and my fears
came to life. I used to fear that they would pronounced my name the the highly emphasized
Spanish sound that many people assume when they see the name Carlos, or anyone from Latin
America. Latin American in the US is taken by many people as Spanish speaking, and we
Brazilians suffer. Brazilians are of Lusitania heritage, not Hispanic, and the names are
pronounced with a softer flow of the syllables, specially Brazilian Portuguese. I was worry
in the manner that the announcer would pronounce and introduce my name. The Professor that I
handle my card to,…look at it,…and could not pronounce my name, he mumble a sound, that I
have no clue what it was. I never saw my name pronounced that way, not even the Carlos part he got
it right.

Later in the evening, the weather got a little cooler, the cool breezy of the evening was
rolling in. Around 1800 students were receiving the Honors medallion. I was referring to us as
the students that didn’t cheat or illegally download papers over the Internet and turned it
in. It is amazing how students are cheating these days with the use of technology. Scary to know
that some will be in front of us making some business decision.



Image: http://carloslacerda.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/medallion.jpg?w=604

And now I am what they call: “A Matador”, and a distinguished “Honoree

Alumnus” from CSUN. What does it all mean? I take it as a personal achievement. It was a gift
from me…to myself. And tomorrow, the Regalia day…I wonder how will I endure the heat
wearing the black cap and gown…it will be worth it!

Bossa Nova, Tropicalismo and MPB



May 16

Posted by carlos

Bossa Nova (* this is a great audio link-in English) is a fusion between Brazilian Samba and
American Jazz. Samba is said to move side-by-side and Jazz front-and-back. The sound emerged
in Brazil in the late 50′s and continued to evolved in the 1960′s and beyond. Bossa Nova
also had influences in later musical movements in Brazil, like the “ MPB ” (Musica Popular
Brasileira- Brazilian Popular Music ) and “ Tropicalismo “ . To my ears, Bossa Nova has a
soft and sweet flow, a certain swing and a fluidity that makes the listener feel a sense of
enlightenment within, giving the soul a rhythm to respond to the emotions of the sounds that
are transmitted in the composition. The key composers and founders of this new sound that
emerged in Rio de Janeiro-Brazil are: Antonio Carlos Jobim , Vinicius de Morais and Joao
Gilberto (father of Bebel Gilberto ). Elizete Cardoso singing “ Chega de Saudade ” gets
the credit for the first recording of the Bossa Nova genre. Bossa emerged due to a need of a less
classical operatic sound, giving specially the youth a new choice in music. The sound is still
evolving and taking new shapes with electronic mixes and variations, but holding to its
distinctive sound and flowing rhythm characteristics. Many times Bossa Nova is referred to
as “ elevator music “, due to its gentle blend and usually as the choice of music to be played
in public arenas. But the Bossa Nova sound took international recognition and became a
worldwide hit sensation after the famous recording by Astrud Gilberto in 1963: “ The Girl
from Ipanema ” (album Getz/Gilberto ), music composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim and English
lyrics by Norman Gimbel ( *Portuguese version by Vinicius de Morais ). The Getz/Gilberto
album won the Grammy “Record and Album of the Year, in 1965″. The list of artist that
recorded the Bossa Nova sound are vast and diverse to mention them all. Some of my favorites
are: Ella Fitzgerald (“ Desafinado “), Sarah Vaughan (aka: S assy ) and Elis Regina . Bossa
Nova has a sensual, cool and lounge sound and the clip I choose to share with you is a beautiful
duet between Frank Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim , an excellent interpretation of the
genre. Bossa Nova is my favorite sound in music…enjoy it!

Brasilia and Oscar Niemeyer



May 12

Posted by carlos

Coming originally from GoiÃ¡s State , situated in the heartland of Brazil, I find myself
with an endearment relationship with BrasÃ­lia and its fantastic architecture. As a
child, I used to visit my cousins that resided in Brasilia, but at that time I was unaware of the
city’s conceptual development. For me was more like family duties, visiting relatives and
behaving (or trying in my case) like a good little boy. But as I learn more about myself, I find an
attraction for designs and architecture of the 1950′s and early 60′s decades. The late
period of modernism is a continuity of exploration of new horizons, and the project and
development of Brasilia is an implementation of progressive ideas and optimism in designing
urban spaces, a complete city in this case. The project was set by Brazilian President
Juscelino Kubitschek , aka: “ JK “. It was decided that the capital of Brazil should be
moved away from Rio de Janeiro. The development of a new capital in the heart of Brazil would
bring more development to the region. The land chosen, a section of GoiÃ¡s State was viewed
as the most favorable location, but of course not without many arguments and debates in favor
or against it. But the main idea was centrality, accessibility to all citizens. Lucio Costa
won the contest to head the urban planning, Burle Marx was in charge of the city landscape
design and Oscar Niemeyer designed and planned the architecture of most public buildings in
Brasilia. Oscar Niemeyer is the person that gets the most international fame and recognition
in regards to the creation of Brasilia, but in reality Lucio Costa visions and the creation of
the “ Plano Piloto “(Pilot Plan) is what gives Brasilia its airplane like shape, the
blueprint for the project. Le Corbusier must also be taken in consideration, he had
influenced Costa and Niemeyer in the ideas and principles of modernism.

Relocating the capital to the heartland of Brazil had a great impact in GoiÃ¢nia , a city
founded in 1933, the capital of Goias State, the place in which I was brought-up. GoiÃ¢nia
early architecture was very much influenced by Art-deco style. The original city-plan for
Goiania was to inhabit 50, 000 people, but today the metropolitan area surpass the 1,600,000
residents.

The video below is a sample of Niemeyer’ creativity and design. Niemeyer will be 100 years
old in December 2007. At the beginning of the video, Niemeyer says: “ I confess you, that I am
tired of talking about architecture. Because things repeat, the conversation is the same,
the questions are the same, everything requires an explanation. Active Mediocrity is shits!
” Also he says: “ The designs were there …(implies that he took the designs from the
region, the landscape and nature itself)”. The clip (2 minutes) is set in Portuguese, but it
gives the viewer an idea. Oscar Niemeyer had also designed the United Nations headquarters in
New York City and other building throughout Brazil.
