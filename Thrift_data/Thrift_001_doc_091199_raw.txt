You always hear the term Upstate New York, are there other Upstates? I have heard the term
downstate a few times but I'm not aware of any Downstate X as a common name for a place. Please
enlighten me.

I'm not familiar with other uses of "Upstate", but there's heavy use of the term "Outstate" in
Minnesota. (The opposite is "the Metro" or "the Cities").

There's "Downstate", which describes everything in the southern peninsula.



There's "Northern Michigan", which describes everything in the northern half of the
southern peninsula.



And then there's the "Upper Peninsula" aka "UP", which is the northern peninsula. And yeah, we

People from upper New York state used that term all the time to distinguish themselves from the

little in with common otherwise.



It makes sense. Northern New York State is closer in culture to New England or the industrial
rust-belt depending on the part you are talking about than it is to New York City. A lot of it is
quite rural. NYC can be a 6 hour drive and world away if you live in Buffalo or Rochester so they
have to head off the confusion when they say they are from 'New York' for people that assume they
know all about the latest Broadway shows. 'Upstate' is the short-hand term they use for it.
People from other states have versions of the same problems but not nearly as large.

as to everything outside of Detroit (when it was the 5th largest city in the US) as "upstate".
Maybe it was "out of state", can't actually recall, but there was a clear distinction between
Detroit and the rest of Michigan.

People from other states have versions of the same problems but not nearly as large. In common
usage, Upstate New York is everything north of New York City (which is the entire state except
for NYC and Long Island).



Northern New York is generally the area north of Albany and Syracuse. So places like Albany,
Syracuse, Buffalo, Rochester, Binghamton, and Poughkeepsie are in Upstate New York but
aren't in Northern New York.



Western New York is everything to the west of Route 81 (except for the strip that's in Northern
New York).



You'll occasionally hear references to Downstate New York but it's not a common term. Mainly
because the area that would normally be considered Downstate New York falls inside the area
that's commonly called Upstate New York. We realize that makes no sense so we just call the area
that should be Downstate New York the Hudson Valley.



Central New York is the area between Western New York, Northern New York, and the Hudson
Valley.



The Catskills are maybe part of Central New York or maybe part of the Hudson Valley. It's an
unsolved mystery.



There are no Eastern or Southern parts of New York.

Though the current politically correct term is "Greater Minnesota". But because that'as
longer & harder to say, most people still use 'outstate' in everything except political
speeches or fromal writings.

    On the Upstate/Downstate line, I have seen it drawn

    - on the northern Brons boundary;

    

    - north of the heavily urbanized group of cities and towns just north of the Bronx
    (Yonkers, Mount Vernon, Rye, etc.);

    

    - north of Westchester County;

    

    - north of Rockland and Puytnam Counties.

There are no Eastern or Southern parts of New York. Two minor nitpicks:



Everything north of Westchester County, as Polycarp suggests above.



There are also the Southern Tier and the East End of Long Island (pretty much everything east of
the Shinnecock canal ). __________________

Depending on the laws they're passing, Springfield can be Chicago or downstate. Usually it's
a Chicago clone.

would never say "Upstate South Carolina" like they do in New York. We say "the Upstate", as in "I
heard it might snow tonight, but that's just in the Upstate."



ETA - we definitely also have a Lowcountry, and people say that a lot. Probably more than
"upstate", actually. That has a cultural meaning as well as a geographical one, though.
Additionally, people do use the geographical divisions we learned in school (mountains,
piedmont, sandhills, etc.) as well as "Midlands", which is where I live and is also a widely
used term.

because, besides Portland, it's all upstate. We do have a "downeast." We also have "The
County," referring to Aroostook County (where I grew up) that encompasses pretty much most of
the northern tip of the state and consists mostly of trees.



I thought it was the largest county (in area) in the states, but apparently there's one bigger
in Missouri.



But I digress ... as usual.

The dumbest thing is Charlotte only has uptown, they decided the word "downtown" was "too
negative" There are plenty of cities with a downtown but no uptown. Oxford, Ohio, has an uptown
but no downtown.

There are also the Southern Tier and the East End of Long Island (pretty much everything east of
the Shinnecock canal ). I once had a "New York City Centrist" coworker who denied the existence
of "Southern Tier" as a term, as he'd never heard it. I'd brought it up because I went to school in
the region, and was describing where the school was. When pressed, he eventually retreated
into the "That's all upstate, who cares?" ploy.

for Long Island. In usage, anything north of where you are in NY is upstate. Your next door
neighbor on the north side lives upstate. Long Island is excepted, even though much of it is
further north than upstate areas in Westchester. Since NYC is the southernmost part of the
state, I think it was intended to refer to the mainland part of the state north of the city.

There's "Downstate", which describes everything in the southern peninsula.



There's "Northern Michigan", which describes everything in the northern half of the
southern peninsula.



And then there's the "Upper Peninsula" aka "UP", which is the northern peninsula. And yeah, we
think it's funny that we're north of "Northern Michigan." Living in MI for 27 years, I've also
heard 'outstate' - anything that's not meto Detroit. Haven't heard that so much recently,

With Michigan, Northern Michigan is the northern part of the Lower Penninsula, essentially
everything north of the Detroit metropolitan area. The Upper Penninsula is the UP, and is not
considered "Northern Michigan." Western Michigan is basically the southwest corner of the
Lower Penninsula.

Upstate. Heck, there are people who think Upstate starts at 125th Street.



I'm familiar with the Southern Tier (used to live in it). Never been in the East End. But those
are local expressions used by people in that part of the state not statewide expressions.

Everything north of Westchester County, as Polycarp suggests above. Odd thing to call a
nitpick. Those are usually small bits of fact that someone got wrong. There's nothing
approaching a consensus as to what comprises up/down state.



Brewster is 'upstate'? Going to tell someone from Buffalo that Newburgh is 'upstate'? People
from Albany barely qualify for upstate, and mostly when they want to be considered as far from
the city as possible. When we left the city for a bit of forest in Sullivan county no one knew the
name of our town, but easily distinguished between up- and downstate.



Sure there are people who think anything outside of the city limits is upstate, but it's pretty
far from a nitpick.

"the UP." I've heard outstate less over the last several years.
