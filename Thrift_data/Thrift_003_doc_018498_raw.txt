St Paul's Cathedral , London, is a Church of England cathedral and seat of the Bishop of London .
Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD
604. [ 2 ] St Paul's sits at the top of Ludgate Hill , the highest point in the City of London , and is
the mother church of the Diocese of London . The present church dating from the late 17th
century was built to an English Baroque design of Sir Christopher Wren , as part of a major
rebuilding program which took place in the city after the Great Fire of London , and was
completed within his lifetime. [ 3 ]

The cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights of London, with its dome,
framed by the spires of Wren's City churches, dominating the skyline for 300 years. [ 4 ] At 365
feet (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1962, and its dome is also
among the highest in the world. In terms of area, St Paul's is the second largest church
building in the United Kingdom after Liverpool Cathedral .

St Paul's Cathedral occupies a significant place in the national identity of the English
population. [ 5 ] It is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as postcard
images of the dome standing tall, surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz . [ 5 ] Important
services held at St Paul's include the funerals of Lord Nelson , the Duke of Wellington and Sir
Winston Churchill ; Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria ; peace services marking the end
of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana
Spencer , the launch of the Festival of Britain and the thanksgiving services for the Golden
Jubilee, the 80th Birthday and the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II . St Paul's Cathedral is a
busy working church, with hourly prayer and daily services.

[ edit ] Previous cathedrals



[ edit ] Pre-Norman



There had been a late-Roman episcopal see in London. According to the tradition recorded by
Bede , the first Saxon cathedral was built by Mellitus in AD 604 in Lundenwic . The unproven
conjecture that it occupied the site of the present cathedral is supported by the fact that it
was these missionaries' habit, as in mainland Europe, to build cathedrals within Roman
cities. However, the Roman city of London, then called Lundenburh , was unoccupied at that
time, unlike conditions in the areas of continental Europe where there was continuity of
urban occupation and ecclesiastic succession. Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed that the
cathedral had been built on the site of a temple dedicated to the goddess Diana , in alignment
with the Apollo temple that he imagined once stood at Westminster , although Christopher Wren
found no evidence of this. Geoffrey was disbelieved by contemporaries, and there is no
evidence of any occupation at the Westminster site in the Roman period. If any church building
existed, perhaps a reutilised existing structure, then it would have only been a modest
chapel at first and may well have been destroyed after Mellitus was expelled from the city by
SÃŠberht 's pagan successors.

Wherever its predecessor was sited, the successor building within the reoccupied City
(built ca 886) was destroyed in a "most fatal fire" in 962, as mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle . Presumably it was made of timber.

The third cathedral was begun in 962, perhaps in stone. In it was buried Ethelred the Unready .
It burnt, with the whole city, in a fire in 1087 , noted in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.20wmf12/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png Old St
Paul's prior to 1561, with intact spire

The fourth St Paul's, known when architectural history arose in the 19th century as Old St
Paul's , was begun by the Normans after the 1087 fire. Work took over 200 years and a great deal
was lost in a fire in 1136. The roof was once more built of wood, which was ultimately to doom the
building. The church was consecrated in 1240, but a change of heart led to the commencement of
an enlargement programme in 1256. When this 'New Work' was completed in 1314 â€” the
cathedral had been consecrated in 1300 â€” it was the third-longest church in Europe and
had one of Europe's tallest spires, at some 489 feet (149 m). Excavations by Francis Penrose in
1878 showed that it was 585 feet (178 m) long and 100 feet (30 m) wide (290 feet or 87 m across
the transepts and crossing ).

By the 16th century the building was decaying. Under Henry VIII and Edward VI , the Dissolution
of the Monasteries and Chantries Acts led to the destruction of interior ornamentation and
the cloisters , charnels , crypts , chapels , shrines , chantries and other buildings in St
Paul's Churchyard. Many of these former religious sites in the churchyard, having been
seized by the Crown, were sold as shops and rental properties, especially to printers and
booksellers, who were often Puritans . Buildings that were razed often supplied
ready-dressed building material for construction projects, such as the Lord Protector's
city palace, Somerset House .

Crowds were drawn to the northeast corner of the churchyard, St Paul's Cross , where open-air
preaching took place. In 1561 the spire was destroyed by lightning and it was not replaced;
this event was taken by both Protestants and Roman Catholics as a sign of God 's displeasure at
the other faction's actions.

England's first classical architect, Inigo Jones , added the cathedral's west front in the
1630s, but there was much defacing mistreatment of the building by Parliamentarian forces
during the Civil War , when the old documents and charters were dispersed and destroyed (Kelly
2004). "Old St Paul's" was gutted in the Great Fire of London of 1666. While it might have been
salvageable, albeit with almost complete reconstruction, a decision was taken to build a new
cathedral in a modern style instead. Indeed this had been contemplated even before the fire.

The task of designing a replacement structure was officially assigned to Sir Christopher
Wren on 30 July 1669. [ 6 ] He had previously been put in charge of designing over fifty other City
churches . During the extensive period of design and rationalisation Wren employed from 1684
Nicholas Hawksmoor as his principal assistant. [ 7 ] Concurrent with designing St Paul's,
Wren was enagaged in the production of his five Tracts on Architecture. [ 7 ]

Wren had begun advising on the repair of the cathedral before the Great Fire of 1666 , in fact as
early as 1661. [ 8 ] This included drawings for the addition of a dome to the existing building to
replace the dilapidated spire, and a restoration of the interiors that would complement the
1630 Inigo Jones-designed facade. [ 9 ] After the fire, the ruins of the building were still
thought to be workable, but ultimately the entire structure was demolished in the early 1670s
to start afresh.

St Paul's went through five general stages of design. The first survives only in the form of a
part of a model and a single drawing. The scheme (usually called the First Model Design)
appears to have consisted of a round domed entrance vestibule (possibly based on the Pantheon
in Rome ) and a rectangular basilica behind containing the choir. It was rejected because it
was not thought "stately enough" [ 10 ] Wrenâ€™s second design was a Greek cross, which
was considered to be too radical by his critics. [ 11 ]

Wren's third proposal for the new St Paul's used many of the same design concepts as his Greek
cross design, though it had an extended nave. This design was embodied in his creation in 1673
of the " Great Model ". The model, made of oak and plaster, cost over Â£500 (approximately
Â£32,000 today) and is over 13 feet (4 m) tall and 21 feet (6 m) long. [ 12 ] His critics,
members of a committee commissioned to rebuild the church and members of the clergy, decried
the design as being too dissimilar from churches that already existed in England at the time to
suggest any continuity within the Church of England. Clergymen also preferred a Latin cross
plan for services. Another problem was that the entire design would have to be completed all at
once because of the eight central piers that supported the dome, instead of being completed in
stages and opened for use before construction finished, as was customary. Wren considered
the Great Model his favourite design, and thought it a reflection of Renaissance beauty. [ 7 ]
After the Great Model, Wren resolved to make no more models or publicly expose his drawings,
which he found to do nothing but "lose time, and subject his business many times, to
incompetent judges". [ 11 ]

Wren's fourth design, the Warrant design, sought to reconcile the Gothic , the predominant
form of English churches, to a "better manner of architecture." Wren attempted to integrate
the same concepts of Renaissance harmony into a more Gothic tradition - however Vaughan Hart
identifies exotic inspiration behind the remarkable pagoda -like spire. [ 7 ] This design was
rotated slightly on its site so that it aligned not with true east, but with sunrise on Easter of
the year construction began. This small change in configuration made by Wren was informed by
his knowledge of astronomy. [ 9 ] His design of the portico was influenced by Inigo
Jonesâ€™s addition to Old St Paul's. [ 11 ]

The final design as built differs substantially from the official Warrant design. [ 13 ] Wren
received permission from the king to make "ornamental changes" to the submitted design, and
Wren took great advantage of this. Many of these changes were made over the course of the thirty
years as the church was constructed, and the most significant was to the dome: "He raised
another structure over the first cupola, a cone of brick, so as to support a stone lantern of an
elegant figure... And he covered and hid out of sight the brick cone with another cupola of
timber and lead; and between this and the cone are easy stairs that ascend to the lantern"
(Christopher Wren, son of Sir Christopher Wren). The final design was strongly rooted in St
Peter's Basilica in Rome . The saucer domes that were eventually added to the design were
inspired by FranÃ§ois Mansart 's Val-de-GrÃ¢ce , which Wren had seen during a trip to
Paris in 1665. [ 7 ] The date of the laying of the first stone of the cathedral is disputed. One
contemporary account says it was on 21 June 1675, another on 25 June and a third on 28 June. There
is, however, general agreement that it was laid in June 1675. Edward Strong later claimed it
was laid by his elder brother, Thomas Strong, one of the two master stonemasons appointed by
Wren at the beginning of the work. [ 14 ]

On 2 December 1697, thirty-two years and three months after a spark from Farryner's bakery had
caused the Great Fire of London, St Paul's Cathedral came into use. The widower King William
III had been scheduled to appear but, uncomfortable in crowds and public displays, had bowed
out at the last minute. The crowd of both the great and the small was so big, and their attitude
towards William so indifferent, that he was scarcely missed. The Right Reverend Henry
Compton , Bishop of London, preached the sermon. It was based on the text of Psalm 122, "I was
glad when they said unto me: Let us go into the house of the Lord." The first regular service was
held on the following Sunday.

The "topping out" of the cathedral (when the final stone was placed on the lantern) took place
in October 1708 and the cathedral was declared officially complete by Parliament on 25
December 1711 (Christmas Day). [ 15 ] In fact construction was to continue for several years
after that, with the statues on the roof only being added in the 1720s. In 1716 the total costs
amounted to Â£1,095,556 [ 16 ] (Â£147 million as of 2012). [ 17 ]

    The consensus was as it is with all such works: some loved it ("Without, within, below,
    above the eye/ Is filled with unrestrained delight."); [ 18 ] some hated it ("...There was
    an air of Popery about the gilded capitals, the heavy arches...They were unfamiliar,
    un-English.."); [ 19 ] while most, once their curiosity was satisfied, didn't think
    about it one way or another.

[ edit ] Structural engineering



Wren's challenge was to construct a large classical cathedral on the relatively weak clay
soil of London. Settlement of the foundations caused major problems, forcing Wren to change
his dome designs as the work progressed. [ 20 ]

The Warrant Design showed external buttresses on the ground floor level. These were not a
classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of
the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external buttresses altogether. The
windows are set into deep recesses in the walls. The upper parts of the cathedral walls are
reinforced with small flying buttresses, which were added at a relatively late design change
to give extra strength. [ 21 ] These are concealed behind a large screen wall, which was added to
keep the building's classical style intact.

The large crossing dome is composed of three layers: the first triple dome ever to be
constructed. The inner and outer layers are catenary curves, but the structural integrity to
support the heavy stone structure atop the dome is provided by an intermediary layer which is
much steeper and more conical in shape. The dome is restrained round its base by a wrought iron
chain to prevent it spreading and cracking. Further iron chains are in some stone bands at
intervals in the brick cone and around the cornice of the peristyle. [ 22 ]

    The construction and decoration of the Cathedral involved many of the foremost artists
    and craftsmen in England; these were:

    - Sir James Thornhill â€“ painted the eight monochrome paintings of the life of St
    Paul that adorn the interior of the dome. [ 23 ] Engravings of the paintings were published
    in 1720. [ 24 ]

    

    - Grinling Gibbons â€“ responsible for the woodwork, most notably the choir
    stalls, [ 25 ] and sculpted the pediment of the north transept. [ 26 ]

    

    - Jean Tijou â€“ most of the wrought ironwork, including the gates flanking the high
    altar . [ 27 ]

    

    - Bernard Smith â€“ designed and built the organ . [ 28 ]

    

    - Caius Gabriel Cibber â€“ sculpted the pediment of the south transept. [ 26 ]

    

    - Francis Bird â€“ sculpted the great west pediment showing the conversion of St
    Paul, [ 29 ] plus the seven large sculptures on the west front. [ 23 ]

The cathedral is built of Portland stone in a late Renaissance style that represents Wren's
vision of a rationalised English Baroque. Its impressive dome was inspired by St Peter's
Basilica in Rome and Mansart 's Church of the Val-de-GrÃ¢ce which Wren had visited. It rises
365 feet (108 m) to the cross at its summit, [ 30 ] dominating both the historic and modern City of
London through the Baroque device of axial perspectives or 'viewing corridors' across the
cityscape. Wren achieved a pleasing balance between interior and exterior by constructing
three domes nested one inside the other: the tall outer dome is non-structural and raised
above the mass of the cathedral to suit distanced views; the lower inner dome provides a
harmoniously balanced interior; between the two a structural cone supports the apex lantern
and the outer dome. Wren was said to have been hauled up to the rafters in a basket during the
building of its later stages to inspect progress.

The nave has three small chapels in the two adjoining aisles â€“ The Chapel of All Souls
and The Chapel of St Dunstan in the north aisle and the Chapel of St Michael and St George in the
south aisle. The main space of the cathedral is centred under the inner dome, which rises 108.4
metres from the cathedral floor and holds three circular galleries â€“ the internal
Whispering Gallery , the external Stone Gallery , and the external Golden Gallery .

The Whispering Gallery runs around the inside of the dome 99 feet (30.2 m) above the cathedral
floor. It is reached by 259 steps from ground level. It gets its name because of the acoustic
effects peculiar to domes; a whisper against its wall at any point is audible to a listener with
an ear held to the wall at any other point around the gallery. A low murmur is equally audible.

The base of the inner dome is 173 feet (53.4 m) above the floor. Its top is about 65 m above the
floor, making this the greatest height of the enclosed space. The cathedral is some 574 feet
(175 m) in length (including the portico of the Great West Door), of which 223 feet (68 m) is
the nave and 167 feet (51 m) is the choir. The width of the nave is 121 feet (37 m) and across
the transepts is 246 feet (75 m). [ 31 ] The cathedral is thus slightly shorter but somewhat
wider than Old St Paul's.

The quire extends to the east of the dome and holds the stalls for the clergy and the choir and the
organ . To the north and south of the dome are the transepts, here called the North Choir and the
South Choir.

Details of the towers at the west end ( illustration, left ) and their dark voids are boldly
scaled, in order to read well from the street below and from a distance, for the towers have
always stood out in the urban skyline. They are composed of two complementary elements, a
central cylinder rising through the tiers in a series of stacked drums, and paired Corinthian
columns at the corners, with buttresses above them, which serve to unify the drum shape with
the square block plinth containing the clock. The main entablature breaks forward over the
paired columns to express both elements, tying them together in a single horizontal band. The
cap, like a bell-shaped miniature dome, supports a gilded finial, a pineapple supported on
four scrolling angled brackets, the topmost expression of the consistent theme.

The clock mechanism was built in 1893 by Smith of Derby incorporating a design of escapement by
Edmund Denison Beckett similar to that used by Edward Dent on the ' Big Ben ' mechanism in 1895.
The clock mechanism is 5.8 metres long and is the most recent of the clocks introduced to St
Paul's Cathedral over the centuries. Since 1969 the clock has been electrically wound with
equipment designed and installed by Smith of Derby, relieving the clock custodian from the
work of cranking up the heavy drive weights.

The north-west tower contains 13 bells hung for change ringing while the south-west contains
four, including Great Paul, at 16Âœ tons [ 32 ] - the largest bell in the British Isles, cast in
1881 by Taylor's bell foundry of Loughborough, Leicestershire, and Great Tom (the hour
bell), recast twice , the last time by Richard Phelps , after being moved from St Stephen's
Chapel at the Palace of Westminster . The bell is only rung on occasions of a death in the royal
family, the Bishop of London, or the Lord Mayor of London , although an exception was made at the
death of US President James Garfield . [ 30 ] In 1717, Richard Phelps cast two more bells that
were added as " quarter jacks ". Still in use today, the first weighs 13 long hundredweights
(1,500 lb; 660 kg), is 41 inches (1,000 mm) in diameter and is tuned to A flat; the second
weighs 35 long hundredweights (3,900 lb; 1,800 kg) and is 58 inches (1,500 mm) in
diameter and is tuned to E flat. Details of the bells Bell Weight Nominal Note Diameter Cast

[ edit ] Post-Wren history



This cathedral has survived despite being targeted during the Blitz - it was struck by bombs on
10 October 1940 and 17 April 1941. On 12 September 1940 a time-delayed bomb that had struck the
cathedral was successfully defused and removed by a bomb disposal detachment of Royal
Engineers under the command of Temporary Lieutenant Robert Davies . Had this bomb detonated,
it would have totally destroyed the cathedral, as it left a 100-foot (30 m) crater when it was
later remotely detonated in a secure location. [ 33 ] As a result of this action, Davies was
awarded the George Cross , along with Sapper George Cameron Wylie . [ 34 ]

iconic St Paul's Survives taken on December 29, 1940 of St Paul's during The Blitz

On 29 December 1940, the cathedral had another close call when an incendiary bomb became
lodged in the lead shell of the dome but fell outwards onto the Stone Gallery and was put out
before it could ignite the dome timbers. One of the most iconic images of London during the war
was a photograph of St Paul's taken the same day by photographer Herbert Mason, from the roof of
the Daily Mail in Tudor Street showing the cathedral shrouded in smoke.

Lisa Jardine of Queen Mary, University of London has written: Wreathed in billowing smoke,
amidst the chaos and destruction of war, the pale dome stands proud and glorious â€“
indomitable. At the height of that air-raid, Sir Winston Churchill telephoned the Guildhall
to insist that all fire-fighting resources be directed at St Paul's. The cathedral must be
saved, he said, damage to the fabric would sap the morale of the country.

Statue of Saint Paul near the Cathedral

The cathedral has a very substantial crypt, holding over 200 memorials, and serves as both the
Order of the British Empire Chapel and the Treasury. The cathedral has very few treasures:
many have been lost, and in 1810 a major robbery took almost all of the remaining precious
artefacts. Christopher Wren was the first person to be interred, in 1723: on the wall above his
tomb in the crypt is written, "Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice" ( Reader, if you
seek his monument, look around you ).

    St Paul's is home to other plaques, carvings, statues, memorials and tombs of famous
    British figures including:

    - Sir John Eardley Inglis

    

    - General Sir Isaac Brock

    

    - Charles Robert Cockerell [ 36 ]

    

    - Sir Edwin Lutyens

    

    - John Donne , whose funeral effigy (portraying him in a shroud) but not his tomb survives
    from Old St Paul's.

    

    - Lord Kitchener

    

    - The Duke of Wellington [ 30 ]

    

    - Lord Nelson [ 30 ]

    

    - Henry Moore

    

    - Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood

    

    - Sir William Alexander Smith

Most of the memorials commemorate the British military, including several lists of
servicemen who died in action, the most recent being the Gulf War . There are special monuments
to Lord Nelson in the south transept and to the Duke of Wellington in the north aisle; both are
buried here. Also remembered are poets, painters, clergy and residents of the local parish.
There are lists of the Bishops and cathedral Deans for the last thousand years.

The cathedral has been the site of many famous funerals, including those of Horatio Nelson,
the Duke of Wellington, Sir Winston Churchill and George Mallory .

Former prime minister Margaret Thatcher is set to have a state funeral at the cathedral upon
her death. [ 37 ]

[ edit ] American Memorial Chapel



The apse of the cathedral is home to the American Memorial Chapel. [ 38 ] It honours American
servicemen and women who died in World War II , and was dedicated in 1958. It was paid for
entirely by donations from British people, and was designed, as a modern exercise in the Wren
style, by Godfrey Allen and Stephen Dykes Bower . [ 39 ] The Roll of Honour [ 40 ] contains the
names of more than 28,000 Americans who gave their lives while on their way to, or stationed in,
the United Kingdom during the Second World War. It is in front of the chapel's altar. The three
chapel windows date from 1960; they feature themes of service and sacrifice, while the
insignia around the edges represent the American states and the US armed forces . The limewood
panelling incorporates a rocket â€“ a tribute to America's achievements in space . [ 41 ]

[ edit ] St Paul's Cathedral Arts Project



The St Paulâ€™s Cathedral Arts Project is an ongoing programme which seeks to explore
the encounter between art and faith . Projects have included installations by Antony Gormley
, Rebecca Horn , Yoko Ono and Martin Firrell .

Internationally acclaimed artist Bill Viola has been commissioned to create two
altarpieces for permanent display in St Paul's Cathedral. The project commenced production
in mid 2009 with completion in early 2012. Following the extensive programme of cleaning and
repair of the interior of St Paul's, completed in 2005, Bill Viola has been commissioned to
create two altarpieces on the themes of Mary and Martyrs. These two multi-screen video
installations will be permanently located at the end of the Quire aisles, flanking the High
Altar of the Cathedral and the American Memorial Chapel where US Service men and women who gave
their lives in the Second World War are commemorated. Each work will employ an arrangement of
multiple plasma screen panels configured in a manner similar to historic altarpieces. The
screens will be mounted on hinged panels, allowing them to be closed.

In Summer 2010, St Paul's chose two new works by the British artist Mark Alexander to be hung
either side of the nave. Both entitled Red Mannheim, Alexander's large red silkscreens are
inspired by the Mannheim Cathedral altarpiece (1739â€“41), which was damaged by
bombing in the Second World War. The original sculpture depicts Christ on the cross,
surrounded by a familiar retinue of mourners. Rendered in splendid giltwood, with Christ's
wracked body sculpted in relief, and the flourishes of flora and incandescent rays from
heaven, this masterpiece of the German Rococo is an object of ravishing beauty and intense
piety.

In March 2010, Flare II, a sculpture by Antony Gormley, was installed in the dramatic setting
of the Geometric Staircase.

In 2007, Dean and Chapter commissioned public artist Martin Firrell to create a major public
artwork to mark the 300th anniversary of the topping-out of Wren's building. The Question
Mark Inside consisted of digital text projections to the cathedral dome, West Front and
inside onto the Whispering Gallery. The text was based on blog contributions by the general
public as well as interviews conducted by the artist and the artist's own views. The project
presented a stream of possible answers to the question: 'what makes life meaningful and
purposeful, and what does St Paul's mean in that contemporary context?' The Question Mark
Inside opened on 8 November 2008 and ran for eight nights.

A 15 year restoration project â€“ one of the largest ever undertaken in the UK â€“
was completed on 15 June 2011. [ 42 ]

[ edit ] Tourism



[ edit ] Interpretation Project



The Interpretation Project is a long term project concerned with bringing St Paulâ€™s
to life for all its visitors. In 2010, the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's opened St Paul's Oculus,
a 270Â° film experience that brings 1400 years of history to life. [ 43 ] Located in the former
Treasury in the crypt, the film takes visitors on a journey through the history and daily life
of St Paul's Cathedral. Oculus was funded by American Express Company in partnership with the
World Monuments Fund , J. P . Morgan, the Garfield Weston Trust for St Paulâ€™s
Cathedral, the City of London Endowment Trust and AIG.

In 2010, new touchscreen multimedia guides were also launched. These guides are included in
the price of admission. Visitors can discover the cathedralâ€™s history,
architecture and daily life of a busy working church with these new multimedia guides. They
are available in 12 different languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish,
Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and British Sign Language (BSL).
The guides have fly-through videos of the dome galleries and zoomable close-ups of the
ceiling mosaics, painting and photography. Interviews and commentary from experts include
the Dean of St Paulâ€™s, conservation team and the Director of Music. Archive film
footage includes major services and events from the cathedral's history.

[ edit ] Charges for sightseers



St Paulâ€™s imposes a Â£14.50 charge for admission to sightseers (Â£12.50 when
purchased online), without the option of a donation. Those attending services do so at no
cost. People seeking a place to be quiet and pray are admitted to the St Dunstan's Chapel free of
charge. Admission on Sundays for all services is free and there is no sightseeing. The
cathedral explains that St Paul's receives little regular or significant funding from the
Crown, Church or the State and claims to rely on the income generated by tourism to allow the
building to continue to function as a centre for Christian worship, as well as to cover general
maintenance and repair work. [ 44 ]

The finances of the cathedral came under public scrutiny during the anti-capitalism Occupy
London encampment in front of the cathedral which began in October 2011. Canon Chancellor
Giles Fraser resigned, warning that to evict the anti-capitalist activists would
constitute â€œviolence in the name of the Church". [ 45 ] It was claimed that the cathedral
was losing revenue of Â£20,000 per day. [ 46 ] The encampment was evicted at the end of
February 2012, after legal action by the City Corporation. [ 47 ]
