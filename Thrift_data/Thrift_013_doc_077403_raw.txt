Edit



Alfonso John Romero (born October 28, 1967, [1 ] in Colorado Springs , Colorado , U.S. ) is a
designer , programmer , and developer in the video game industry . He is best known as a
co-founder of id Software and was a designer for many of their games, including Wolfenstein 3D
, Dangerous Dave , Doom and Quake . His game designs and development tools , along with new
programming techniques created and implemented by id Software's lead programmer John D.
Carmack , led to a mass popularization of the first person shooter , or FPS, in the 1990s. He is
credited with coining the FPS multiplayer term " deathmatch ". [2 ]

Apple II

data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



John Romero's first published game, Scout Search , appeared in the June 1984 issue of inCider
magazine , a popular Apple II magazine during the 1980s. Romero's first company, Capitol
Ideas Software , was listed as the developer for at least 12 of his earliest published games.
Romero captured the December cover of the Apple II magazine Nibble for three years in a row
starting in 1987. He won a programming contest in A+ magazine during its first year of
publishing with his game Cavern Crusader .

Romero's first industry job was at Origin Systems in 1987 after programming games for 8 years.
He worked on the Apple II to Commodore 64 port of 2400 A.D. , which was eventually scrapped due to
slow sales of the Apple II version. Romero then moved onto Space Rogue , a game by Paul Neurath .
During this time, Romero was asked if he would be interested in joining Paul's soon-to-start
company Blue Sky Productions, eventually renamed Looking Glass Technologies . Instead,
Romero left Origin Systems to co-found a game company named Inside Out Software , where he
ported Might & Magic II from the Apple II to the Commodore 64. He had almost finished the
Commodore 64 to Apple II port of Tower Toppler , but Epyx unexpectedly cancelled all its ports
industrywide due to their tremendous investment in the first round of games for the upcoming
Atari Lynx .

During this short time, Romero did the artwork for the Apple IIGS version of Dark Castle , a port
from the Macintosh. During this time, John and his friend Lane Roathe co-founded a company
named Ideas from the Deep and wrote versions of a game named Zappa Roidz for the Apple II, PC and
Apple IIGS. Their last collaboration was an Apple II disk operating system ( InfoDOS ) for
Infocom's games Zork Zero , Arthur , Shogun and Journey .

id Software

data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



Romero moved to Shreveport, Louisiana in March 1989 and joined Softdisk as a programmer in its
Special Projects division. After several months of helping the PC monthly disk magazine Big
Blue Disk , he officially moved into the department until he started a PC gaming division in
July 1990 named 'Gamer's Edge' (originally titled PCRcade). Romero hired John D. Carmack
into the department from his freelancing in Kansas City, moved Adrian Carmack into the
division from Softdisk's art department, and persuaded Tom Hall to come in at night and help
with game design. Romero and the others then left Softdisk in February 1991 to form id Software
. [3 ]

Romero worked at id Software from its incorporation in 1991 until 1996. He was involved in the
creation of several milestone games, including Commander Keen , Wolfenstein 3D , Doom , Doom
II and Quake . [3 ] He served as executive producer (and game designer) on Heretic and Hexen . He
designed most of the first episode of Doom , most of the levels in Quake , half the levels in the
Commander Keen , Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny . He wrote many of the tools used at id
Software to create their games, including DoomEd (level editor), QuakeEd (level editor), DM
(for deathmatch launching), DWANGO client (to connect the game to DWANGO's servers), TED5
(level editor for the Commander Keen series, Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny ), IGRAB (for
grabbing assets and putting them in WAD files ), the installers for all the games up to and
including Quake , the SETUP program used to configure the games, and several others.

Ion Storm

Edit



Main article: Daikatana [1] [2] The now infamous Daikatana "suck it down"
advertisementRomero later co-founded Ion Storm in Dallas, Texas with id co-worker Tom Hall ,
where he designed and produced Daikatana . [3 ] This ambitious shooter was announced in 1997
with a release date for the Christmas shopping season of that year. However, this release date
slipped repeatedly in the coming months, and the game began to accrue negative press.

In particular, a 1997 advertisement boasting "John Romero's About To Make You His
Bitch....Suck it down" caused controversy amongst gamers and the gaming press. [4 ] The
massive pre-hype for the game and the subsequent delays (it was not released until April 2000)
were compounded by the poor reviews the game received when it was finally complete. [5 ] Upon
release, Daikatana was critically panned and appeared on numerous "top 10 worst games"
listings. In 1999, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100
innovators in the world under the age of 35. [6 ]

During this time, Romero was rumored to have been killed (aptly enough, with a headshot ) and a
photograph of his corpse with a bullet wound was also spread through the Internet; Romero
himself later stated that the picture was taken for the magazine Texas Monthly , and that
"maybe he shouldn't have taken it". [7 ]

Romero departed with Tom Hall immediately after the release of Hall's Anachronox game and the
subsequent closing of the Dallas Ion office.

Monkeystone Games

Edit



In July 2001, Romero and Hall founded Monkeystone Games in order to develop and publish games
for mobile devices , and Monkeystone released 15 games (approximately) during its short
lifespan of three and a half years. Some highlights of their developments included
Hyperspace Delivery Boy! (Pocket PC, PC, Mac, Linux, GBA), Congo Cube (Pocket PC, PC, BREW ,
Java ME ), and a version of Red Faction for the Nokia N-Gage . He and his girlfriend, Stevie Case ,
broke up in 2003, and she left the company in May while Red Faction development continued until
October. John then left Monkeystone Games' day-to-day operations to Lucas Davis while
Romero and Hall left for Midway in San Diego. [8 ]

Midway Games

Edit



In mid-October 2003, Romero joined Midway Games as project lead on Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows .
While he continued to maintain his working relationship with Monkeystone, Lucas Davis took
over running the office. The Monkeystone team moved to Austin, Texas to work on Midway's Area
51 title until its release. Monkeystone Games closed down in January 2005. Romero moved from
project lead to creative director of internal studio during this time.

At the end of June 2005, Romero left Midway Games mere months before the completion of
Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows .

Slipgate Ironworks

data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



On August 31, 2005, Romero confirmed [9 ] that he has been working on a yet-to-be-announced
MMOG at his newly opened development studio, Slipgate Ironworks. It has been reported that
the name is temporary. "For the record," Romero wrote, "I'm co-founder of a new game company in
the Bay Area and am much better off in many ways than I was at Midway". He said that he would not
reveal anything about the company or the game until 2007. On March 17, 2009 it was announced
that Slipgate Ironworks is part of Gazillion Entertainment . [10 ] According to Romero, he is a
co-founder [11 ] of Gazillion.

On July 22, 2006, John Romero and former co-worker Tom Hall guest hosted episode 53 of the
podcast The Widget . [12 ]

Romero departed Gazillion Entertainment in November 2010 to form a social game company
called Loot Drop alongside Brenda Brathwaite . [13 ] His long time co-worker, Tom Hall joined
the company on January 1, 2011. [14 ] [15 ]

Cyberathlete Professional League

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



John Romero was the CPL's Chairman of the Board for ten years.

On December 20, 2006, John Romero announced a new FPS project for the Cyberathlete
Professional League titled Severity for both consoles and PC. [16 ] It was announced that Tom
Mustaine (ex-Studio Director at Ritual Entertainment ) would act as Director of Game
Development at CPL's new studio.

It is stated that Severity will be a multiplayer first person shooter. The game will be built on
technology licensed from id Software.

In September 2008 Romero told ThatGamingSite that Severity was canceled, but Tom Mustaine
contacted the site to inform them the project was not canceled but in "stealth mode" citing
John Romero was "let out of the loop". [ citation needed ] On October 2009, Angel Munoz , founder
of the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) stated that Severity was no longer being
produced because they were not able "to convince game publishers of its value". [17 ]

In March 2010, John Romero collaborated with the gaming magazine Retro Gamer and taking on the
role of a guest editor, taking charge of the magazine's editorial and contributing to a number
of articles and subjects throughout the magazine. There is an extensive interview with

Edit



In the Doom II final level "Icon of Sin", the boss is supposed to be a giant demon head with a
fragment missing from its forehead. It says, "To win the game, you must kill me, John Romero!",
distorted and in reverse to sound like a demonic chant. One can use the idclip cheat to enter the
boss and see Romero's severed head which is skewered on a post. The player defeats the boss
(without the noclip cheat) by shooting rockets into its exposed brain after activating a lift
and riding it; Romero's head functions as its hit detection point; when he "dies", the boss is
killed and the game is finished.

The name "Romero" is written in blood on one of the walls in level 19 "Shipping/Respawning" in
Final Doom .

Design rules

data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



    When designing levels for Doom, Romero came up with several rules, among them:

    - always changing floor height when I wanted to change floor textures

    

    - using special border textures between different wall segments and doorways

    

    - being strict about texture alignment

    

    - conscious use of contrast everywhere in a level between light and dark areas, cramped
    and open areas

    

    - making sure that if a player could see outside that they should be able to somehow get
    there

    

    - being strict about designing several secret areas on every level

    

    - making my levels flow so the player will revisit areas several times so they will better
    understand the 3D space of the level

    

    - creating easily recognizable landmarks in several places for easier navigation [5]

    



Notes

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit

    

    - John Romero is a character in Mike "Cyb" Watson 's modification MassMouth 2 .

    

    - John Romero has shown interest in the currently WIP Doom The Way Id Did

    

    - John likes listening to heavy metal music . He supplied Bobby Prince a large number of
    heavy metal records, which was the inspiration for the MIDI rock music used in Doom 1 and
    Doom 2 .

    

    

        - Daikatana was referenced in two Doom WADs:

        - In Action Doom , the first level contains an ad " Scuba Steve is a whiny little bitch" -
        a reference to the Daikatana ad.

        

        - In the last level of Action Doom, a Daikatana box is on the table in the player's room.

        

        - In MassMouth 2, Daikatana is given as a prize for saving Worm and killing Romero.
