E-Dog Designs

Posted in Maisto by dstroyr on September 16, 2010

Recently I stopped by my friend E-Dog’s place to catch up and see what projects he had going
on. E-Dog (government name is Eric Michaud) is an extremely talented builder, painter,
fabricator, and just plain good dude. Truly a inspiration to myself and other artist around
the globe, his DIY approach is motivation enough to build anything. He was pin striping a
Â Schwinn Stingray when I came thru, so I capped a few pics around the garage.

His personal car is a 1966 T-Bird and it’s super gnarly, you can’t miss it on the road, the
anti freeze green with flames and a purple top is a stand out. I was unable to get a proper photo of
since we were in the garage on this night.

E-Dog sent over some pics last night of his car, these photos only give you a glimpse of how much
work is done. And done 100% by his own hands!

Break Time Maisto Monster Drift R/C Battle

Posted in Maisto TECH , Videos by dstroyr on September 15, 2010

Not gonna lie working for a die cast company is pretty fun. Today we had a random attempt at a
tandem battle with the Maisto Monster Drift R/C. B-Rad and myself loaded up some batteries and
smashed the controllers. Not much tandem action, but still fun for sure. And with Formula
Drift season ending next month, these R/C cars will have to hold me over till next year.

Well, since RHB is goneâ€Šjet setting around the globe, kissing babies, shaking hands
and the like, guess that means I should throw a blog up.

So my contribution this week will be the introduction of the last of the 2010 Target Allstar RED
Transporters. These little hotties should already be in your local Target stores, if they
arenâ€™t, they will be soon so keep an eye out.

We have chosen 2 automotive icons to close out the 2010 season, the race themed 1957 Chevrolet
Bel Air and cloaked in fire gear, the 2010 Ford Mustang GT.

Hereâ€™s a quiz for â€˜ya, who can identify the history behind the fire theme?
Sorry, no prize for this one, youâ€™ll just be a little wiser.

Enjoy!

And for your viewing pleasure, here are the other 6 that complete this years release.

The 1955 Buick Century fire theme and the 1929 Ford race theme

The 1971 Vega Salt Flat Racer

Speedway Inspiration

Posted in Maisto by dstroyr on September 10, 2010

For those of you who are not familiar with speedway here is a basic overview straight from the
wikipage.

Motorcycle speedway , usually referred to asÂ  speedway , is aÂ  motorcycle sport
involving four and sometimes up to six riders competing over four anti-clockwise laps of an
oval circuit. SpeedwayÂ  motorcycles use only oneÂ  gear and have noÂ  brakes and
racing takes place on a flat oval track usually consisting ofÂ  dirt or loosely packedÂ 
shale . Competitors use this surface to slide their machines sideways, powersliding orÂ 
broadsiding into the bends. On the straight sections of the track the motorcycles reach
speeds of up 70Â miles per hour (110 km/h).

Originating in Maitland ,Â  New South Wales , Australia, in the 1920s, [1] there are now both
domestic and international competitions in a number of countries including theÂ 
Speedway World Cup whilst the highest overall scoring individual in theÂ  Speedway Grand
Prix events is pronounced the world champion. Speedway is popular inÂ  central andÂ 
northern Europe and to a lesser extent in Australia and North America. A variant ofÂ  track
racing , speedway is administered internationally by theÂ  FÃ©dÃ©ration
Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). Domestic speedway events are regulated by FIM
affiliated nationalÂ  motor sport federations .

My Dad would take me to AscotÂ Park way back when I was a little kid to watch the high speed
action. And I still make an effort to catch a race or 2 during the season (would like to make it out
more). So inspired by these speed demons I ended up creating a t-shirt graphic for DSTROYR that
has become a staple design for the brand.

So this week one of my assignments was to create a new deco for the 1:18 Speedway Motorcycle.
Some of my favorite time spent designing beside the actual design is researching the subject.
You may have an understanding of what you are going to do, but brushing up never hurts. While on
my research adventure thru the internet I came across several images, videos, and this
surprise.

A UK website takes the Maisto 1:18 Speedway Motorcycle and makes replicas of actual speedway
bikes and teams. No Brakes UK is the site and it all started with the Maisto 1:18 scale speedway
bike . These replicas started as hand painted pieces of art, and have since been translated to
water decals and clear lacquer for protection.

Below are a few examples of the custom work done over at No Brakes UK .

Halo Reach release party

Posted in Maisto by CASTRO on September 9, 2010

Last night I was invited by a good friend (fellow toy designer) to attend the Halo Reach
official release party. My buddy works at Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory and tells me
Microsoft is using the factory for it’s release of the new game (Halo Reach). So of course I
was like, HELL YES! I love Halo, so do my kids. Needless to say the night was pretty awesome. I
showed up a little early and got a quick “mini-tour” of Corpo and the factory.

Halo Reach Entrance

There were xbox 360 consoles and flat screens everywhere! Some were linked up so multiple
players could check out the new game and kick the crap out of each other. All I have to say, is the
friggin Jetpack rules!!! I have a whole new respect for Halo with this release. There are some
awesome new features and some bitchin new and updated weaponry. Yeah, the party going on
behind us, don’t bother us, we’re gaming here! Hey dj can you turn that down? You’re
drowning out my Jetpack sound.

Some of us nerds getting our Halo Reach on.

The crowd starts to arrive, they got greeted by an awesome “hollywood style” step and
repeat of Halo Reach, Xbox, and Microsoft. Then they got to walk up a Halo ramp into a Halo world.
It was pretty amazing.

Halo Crowd

This is Rob Dyrdek’s T-rex, I wanted to take it out for a spin, but you know, too many people in
the way.

Rob's T-Rex

The stars were out, apparently I missed some of them, but Michelle Rodriguez, Zachary Levi,
Nathan Fillion, Justin Beiber, B.o.B, Diplo, Olivia Munn, and I don’t know who else, but
they were there. I heard one of the guys from Office Space was there, it was like NERD HEAVEN.
Here’s Michelle Rodriguez trying out Halo Reach. She seemed to really like it.

Got a chance to meet and chat with some of the game’s designers/developers from Bungie.
Really cool dudes, who flew out just for this party. They were like the rockstars of the night in
my opinion.

The musical performances were awesome. B.o.B and his band kicked arse and had all the hipsters
shaking their booties.

I had never listened to Diplo before, but his set was pretty much fire. Looking into his musical
catalog now.

We met Zachary Levi from Chuck, turns out he is toy nerd just like us. Very cool dude.

Cisco, Trace, Zachary Levi from Chuck, and Castro

See here, I thought my desk and toy collecting habit was bad, but Tracy has since surpassed my
TOY NERDINESS. This is about 1% of the toys in his office. NERD.

One thing I realized after this awesome night in L.A., I NEED A NEW CAMERA. Oh wait, there is ONE
MORE THING….
