Step into our Delorean back to Ottawa’s first comiccon!

Written by Yasmin Nissim on Thursday May 17th, 2012



Image: http://apt613.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Picture-1-270x169.png

This past weekend the CE Centre was overrun with a fabulous array of self-styled geeks, freaks
and misfits attending Ottawaâ€™s first ever Comiccon. Costumed attendees pulled out
all the stops with everything from amazingly detailed Steampunk gadgets and gizmos, to
scantily clad villains and vixens. There was even a working replica of the The Delorean Time
Machine (for the uninitiated, thatâ€™s the time machine from the Back to the Future
movies that looks a bit like the love child of an 80â€™s era Toyota Corolla and a
Lite-Brite).



Created with Admarket’s flickrSLiDR .

Despite large crowds and lineups, the length of which would put a Krayt Dragon to shame, the
energy was positive and the people were all smiles. There was a feeling of camaraderie in the
air as the multitudes gathered to meet great legends of geekdom and peruse the dozens of booths
filled to the brim with fanboy paraphernalia. Along with panel discussions including
favourites like William Shatner, Jeremy Bulloch and Lou Ferrigno , there were also creative
break-away sessions where Comiccon attendees could learn the basics of Steampunk gadgetry
or the intricacies of Imperial armour.

As a first time convention goer, there was a bit of a learning curve for me in terms of
merchandise and etiquette. In terms of merch, I had very much underestimated the costs
associated with this kind of event and what I could expect to pay for. For example, seeing the
opportunity to meet John De Lancie (â€œQâ€� of Star Trek: Next Generation fame), I
quickly hopped on the line ride only to discover that any photo ops or autographs had a price tag
attached.

Depending on who you were interested in, you could be shelling out anywhere between thirty and
seventy-five dollars for a famous scribble or celeb photo. A bit out of my price range, but then
there was no cost to just say hello which was not at all discouraged. This is how I found out that
Marina Sirtis (Deana Troi also from the Next Generation cast) is an awesome, down-to-earth
individual who really seems to take joy in meeting her fans, of which I am a big one.

In terms of etiquette, itâ€™s important to note that each guest has different rules when
it comes to taking their picture or recording them. Some speakers will allow for photos during
the first few minutes of their panel discussions, while others donâ€™t mind at all if you
snap away the whole time. Others still donâ€™t appreciate it when people jump the
autograph line to take a quick picture. If in doubt, ask a volunteer, but if youâ€™ve been
given rules itâ€™s best to adhere to them to avoid ticking off the guests…I mean who
really wants to be on Shatnerâ€™s shit list?

The one thing that was a bit disappointing was that some of the amazing workshops were during
the panel discussions, and unfortunately once the workshops began the entry doors were
locked. It wasnâ€™t possible to duck between the two sessions unless perhaps you
started in the workshop, but then you would be out of luck for decent seats in the panel
discussion and the chance to ask the speaker a question. To be honest though, this is really a
complaint that there was just too much awesome for me to take in at one time! Overall, this is one
event I do hope will become a regular event for all of us Ottawa otaku .
