Most defense lawyers for Mexican drug traffickers have shortened life spans – Americo
Delgado outlived most

Posted on September 2, 2009 | 3 Comments

[YouTube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfK_KUGD8i8]

The striking thing about the fate of Mexican defense attorney Americo Delgado, who defended
various Mexican drug traffickers over the years, is not so much that he was murdered recently
– but that he had apparently lived to be in his 80s.

The Los Angeles Time s’ Ken Ellingwood reported on Delgado’s killing in this story, which
explains howÂ Â Delgado was stabbed to death by a group of men in front of his home in
Toluca, Mexico.

I remember reaching Americo Delgado by phone once when I was a reporter at The San Diego-Union
Tribune, covering border news. I was seeking a quote from him in regards to the U.S.
government’s efforts to extradite his clientÂ  Benjamin Arellano-Felix , the former
high-ranking member of the Arellano Felix drug group ( Arellano was eventually extradited ).
The fact that he even took Â my call was somewhat amazing to me.

Over the seven years I worked in Tijuana, I interviewed or talked to several other Mexican
defense attorneys who represented people who were either directly or indirectly involved
with major drug groups. One of them was gunned down shortly after I chatted with him (no
connection). Another one ended up being killed and stuffed inside a car trunk.

I occasionally wondered how Americo Delgado Â - who defended some of the drug world’s top
lieutenants – Â managed to avoid the fate of his less-fortunate colleagues in this
shadowy world where “just doing one’s job” is complicated by the deeper symbolism and
loyalties that the drug trafficking world operates on. Delgado had most recently been
defending suspected drug trafficker Alfredo Beltran Leyva, according to newspaper reports
.

The Los Angeles connection to Mexico’s Arellano-Felix cartel

Posted on July 15, 2009 | Leave a comment



Image: http://acrosstheborder.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/felixa.jpg?w=214&h=300
The U.S. media gets Â flack from some Mexicans for focusing so much attention on the drug
violence that happens south of the border.

“Why doesn’t anyone write about the top-level drug traffickers in your own country?”
Â was a question posed to me once by Jesus Blancornelas , the editor of Tijuana’s
muckracking weekly Zeta newspaper when I first started working as a border reporter with The
San Diego Union-Tribune nine years ago. Blancornelas, who regularly wrote about the
Arellanos and other drug groups operating along the Mexican border, Â had almost been
killed in an ambush in 1997 that was later tied to the Arellano-Felix drug cartel.

To him, it didn’t make sense that so much attention was placed on drug traffickers and
violence south of the border when it appeared to him those drugs had to be distributed through a
centralized system north of the border that would require some degree of institutional
corruption. I replied that perhaps it was a question of the scope of the problem being much
larger in Mexico – a valuable transit area with weaker institutions – Â than in the
United States: Mexico had its capos , and the U.S. had smaller-scale dealers with lower
profiles.

Still, his question lingered with me over the years as I occasionally wrote about the
Arellano-Felix drug group’sÂ  activities in San Diego and Chula Vista . Recently, I read
a story in the Los Angeles Times that explored a connection with the Arellano-Felix drug
cartel in a 101-Freeway shooting in December, 2008, that left the the driver of a $100,000
Bentley dead. According to a search warrant affidavit obtained by the paper, the victim
“might have been selling drugs here for the notorious Arellano Felix cartel.” (Read the
article here)

I thought that when I took a job in Los Angeles last year I had left the Arellanos behind, but I
guess not. They are, in a sense, everywhere.

How drug traffickers stay fit in Mexico

Posted on June 12, 2009 | 4 Comments



Image: http://acrosstheborder.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/picture-10.png?w=500
The fact that another suspected Arellano Felix drug cartel member had been arrested in
Tijuana wasn’t as interesting to me as where he was found. Mexican media reported that
Filiberto Parra Ramos was detained June 10Â  either inside or just outside the Total
Fitness Gym,Â  in the city’s Â Zona Rio business district.

That’s the same gym I used to go to when I lived in Tijuana, and to be honest I’m a little
surprised he wasn’t going to the swankier Sports World Tijuana gym (the Arellanos’
recreation budget must have been cut). I remember visiting both gyms and deciding not to got to
Sports World because the monthly membership was closer to $300 (someone correct me here, if
needed…) and because it seemed to be the kind of place where people looked great but didn’t
seem to be capable of sweating.

At Total Fitness the equipment area was a little more cramped but there was a lot of sweating
going on. Both places had some similar details, such as rock scaling areas and lap pools. At
Total Fitness, I had a membership for about $100 a month and a personal trainer who was
preparing for a body building competition. At times he seemed more interested in his own
physique, but he dutifully kept me from cutting corners with the weights and sneaking off the
bikes too early.

Both mega-gyms opened sometime after the year 2000, providing an alternative for wealthier
Tijuanenses whose exercise options had previously involved jogging at public park
facilities or crossing the border to work out in Chula Vista. For me, the main impetus to work
out was to stay fit in my jeans. The stakes are probably much higher for someone like Parra, who
was reportedly part of the Arellanos’ killer squad.Â

San Diego Magazine revisits 2006 Rosarito beheadings

Posted on April 3, 2009 | 1 Comment

Â 



Image: http://acrosstheborder.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/felixa.jpg?w=214&h=300
San Diego Magazine Â isÂ  publishing a series of stories about drug trafficking along
the border. Â In the first installment, S.D. Liddick explores the case of the 2006
beheadings of the Rosarito Beach police officers, which was linked to the Arellano-Felix
drug organization. It’s well worth the read. Liddick spent considerable time collecting
information for this story. I know because at one point when I still worked atÂ  The San Diego
Union-Tribune ,Â he lost the cell phone number for the former Rosarito police
chiefÂ Valente Montijo-Pompa Â - and I helped him get back in touch with the chief.

The story is skillfully written with powerful insights into the corruptible forces of drug
trafficking, including some fascinating quotes by realist Montijo-Pompa, who freely
admitsÂ â€œIâ€™m not going to fight with somebody whose circumstances are
1,000 to my one. Iâ€™m not going to be a heroâ€”to kill my people. Iâ€™m not
going to sacrifice others or convert Rosarito into a battleground or put innocents in the
middle.”

With Mexican drug trafficking violence the “hot” topic over the past year or so, Â many
media groups are jostling for a chance to claim their stake in this story. Of course, the story
has been going on for years but the degree of attention tends to correspond to body counts.
It’s no surprise thatÂ  San Diego Magazine Â would explore this issue in depth, and
kudos to the magazine for investing the time and resources in doing so. I look forward to
reading the upcoming installments. My only issue with the first article is that I think it
takes an unwarranted and unsubstantiated swipe at the quality of border coverage by other
media groups in a curious attempt to elevate the article’s authority. You can read my
opinionÂ  in the story’s online comments section .

Read the first installment ofÂ  “Blood of Their Brothers: The Border Trilogy”
Â here.

Revisiting Miguel Felix Gallardo

Posted on March 17, 2009 | 1 Comment

Â 



Image:
http://acrosstheborder.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/picture-1.png?w=300&h=243 I
feel an odd sort of connection with Miguel Felix Gallardo , who was reputedly the precursor to
the Â Baja California area’sÂ  Arellano Felix drug trafficking organization. Â A
blog post I filed last year - about a web site set up by the reputed drug trafficker’s family
– continues to generate a lot of traffic to my own site Â from people apparently curious
about Felix Gallardo’s savvy use of the Internet.

Felix Gallardo, according to Mexican and U.S. reports, is an older relative of the Arellano
Felix brothers (a family member says this is not true), and he was said to be a major Mexican drug
trafficker in the 1980s. He has been locked up in a Mexican prison since 1989. Family members
started a web site to document his health needs in prison as well as a forum for people to ask
questions and send greetings to Felix Gallardo. You can check out the site here.

Here are a couple of media updates on Felix Gallardo:

McClatchy News Service wrote a story about the Felix Gallardo website and about the use of the
Internet by Mexican drug traffickers in general. Â Reporter Marisa Taylor interviewed
Felix Gallardo’s son, who started the website. You can read the story here.

In February of this year, Mexican media ran a story about Felix Gallardo writing a 32-page
letter to La Jornada newspaper detailing his experiences with certain Mexican law
enforcement officials, as well as other juicy details of his own arrest. You can read the La
Jornada story here .

What’s your favorite Mexican soup? a) pozole b) menudo c) tlalpeno

Posted on February 13, 2009 | 9 Comments



Image:
http://acrosstheborder.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/tlalpenoa.jpg?w=500&h=374

Â 

I’m not a big fan of menudo or Â  pozole , but the soups have such a strong following in Mexico
that entire businesses are built around serving them. Lately, the pozole-makers had to deal
with some bad PR Â since the soup name showed up in headlines related to the arrest of a drug
cartel suspect who made an entirely different kind of pozole. Â (I’m not going to spoil
your appetite, but you can learn moreÂ  here ( Los Angeles Times ) , here(video),Â  and
here( El Universal )

I do like Caldo Tlalpeno , a chicken-and-rice soup punctuated with a super-hot, large chile.
Garbanzos and avocado chunks provide additional texture, along with onion and cilantro
sprinkles. Served with corn tortillas, I find it to be quite satisfying. My personal
favorites in Tijuana are the ones at Ricardo’s (pictured above) and the old Victor’s
restaurant, though I’m sure there are plenty of other great ones.

On the same subject of soups, the Los Angeles Times Â recently ran a story about Mexico City
opening its first ever soup kitchen due to the tough economic times. You can access the story
and video, by Deborah Bonello, here.

North of the border, Â here’s a “Caldo de Camaron” recipe from a blogger who dishes up
shrimp soup secrets and her own interesting perspectives on the Eastside of Los Angeles at her
site, Swapmeet Chronicles.

Profiling the drug wars

Posted on December 18, 2008 | Leave a comment

The Los Angeles Times’ Â Richard Marosi writes about one of the people believed to be
responsible for a whole lot of killings in Tijuana: Teodoro Garcia Simental. You can read and
learn more here about the suspected drug trafficker, who is also known as “El Teo.”Â 

These guys don’t like being placed in the spotlight, speaking from personal experience
from my days of covering this sort of thing for The San Diego Union-Tribune . But perhaps
“Teo” feels a little better with the attention sinceÂ he was overlooked on Â Detail
magazine’s blog of “Most Influential” people of the year . (His nemesis –
Â suspected trafficker Francisco Sanchez Arellano Â - made the list).

If you are looking for more information on the personalities behind the big guns, you can read
this story by Tracy Wilkinson , also of the Los Angeles Times, about Joaquin “El Chapo”
Guzman, the suspected head of a drug group that is battling the Tijuana region’s
once-dominant Arellano-Felix cartel .

I wish I could link to an indepth profile of the former head of the Arellano cartel – the
now-imprisoned Benjamin Arellano-Felix – Â that was written by S. Lynne Walker. She
wrote it when she was based out of Mexico City for Copley News Service, but it doesn’t seem to
be available online. If anyone finds that story, or any other noteworthy profiles, let me
know.

Tijuana neighbors

Image:
http://acrosstheborder.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/myplace1.jpg?w=225&h=300 The
capture of a major suspected drug trafficker at a Tijuana house this weekend got me thinking
about the place I called home for almost two years: The apartment complex is in a peaceful
neighborhood just a few minutes from Tijuana’s Avenida Revolucion, but as you can see
it’s surrounded by walls

I ended up at here because I Â wanted to feel safe. If you write enough stories about the drug
cartels, people come out of the woodwork with unclear motives. Besides, I also needed a place
to park both my personal car and the company car (belonging to The San Diego Union-Tribune ).
Most places I looked at had parking space for just one car, but this one gave me two spaces that
were tucked out of the sight of car thieves. So I ended up paying about $680 a month for a unit in
this four-storied condo complex, which had a light-filled atrium and a daytime security
guard/handyman called Raul.Â Â There was constant turnover in this complex, Â and a
fair number of expensive vehicles, but most everyone who lived here kept to themselves and I
was left to imagine the untold stories behind these quiet walls.Â 

Homes in Tijuana’s nicest neighborhoods homes are typically protected with
fortress-like walls to keep out burglars and car thieves. The irony is that sometimes the true
criminals are living inside these same protective enclaves. This past weekend, Mexican
authorities detained Eduardo Arellano-Felix, Â who comes from a drug trafficking family
that once dominated Tijuana but whose members are rapidly moving into shabbier quarters at
Mexican and U.S. prisons. Looking more like a soccer dad than one of the Drug Enforcement
Agency’s Most Wanted , Arellano was found in a house in one of Tijuana’s nicer
neighborhoods, with his young daughter, according to T he San Diego Union-Tribune.

In addition to this Union-Tribune story about his detention, Â you can read this story in
The Los Angeles Times and listen to this report by KPBS-San Diego.

Tijuana’s broken heart

Posted on October 6, 2008 | 1 Comment



Image:
http://acrosstheborder.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/ilovetja.jpg?w=300&h=300 This
pamphlet – with bullet holes piercing a heart – Â was distributed inside a program for
the recentÂ  San Diego trolley dances . Â In addition to calling for cross-border
artistic collaboration, Â it expresses succinctly the mood of the city these days.

Mexican media report that close to 60 people were killed this past week in the city , most of them
presumably the result of feuding drug groups. Based on my previous experience reporting
about crime south of the border, it was a bad month when 60 people were killed (the numbers
usually ranged between 20 and 35).

Tijuana’s Frontera newspaper also reported that the city’s Secretary of Public
Security, Alberto Capella, recommended residents sit tight Â - inside their homes – and
have faith that law enforcement will restore the peace.Â An article this weekend in The San
Diego Union-Tribune isn’t so optimistic.

To be sure, most of the cases involved dumped bodies. That has become somewhat more acceptable
here since the killings are seen as a settling of scores among criminals and done behind closed
doors. But this weekend, Â  Frontera reported that three innocent bystanders were killed
in a shootout.

As others have explained to me over the years, there will always be a certain level of
drug-related violence here (as long as there is a demand for drugs in the U.S.), Â but in
normal circumstances the outbreaks are controlled by the most powerful groups. When those
traffickers are weakened, as has been the case in a prolonged government push against certain
long-standing groups, a different level of violence is touched off by the entry of newer
groups and internal rifts.Â That is the case for the region’s Â  Arellano Felix drug
cartel , which has been in a slow but steady downhill spiral since 2000.

This kind of violence targets people involved in drug cartel activities – not tourists.
This is why you don’t hear about cartel-related shootings or dumped bodies on the popular
tourist strip of Avenida Revolucion or near the cultural arts center. Â I’ve also found
that moments of extreme violence can be followed by months of relative calm. This blog will
continue to include noteworthy developments but postings like this one aren’t meant to be
alarmist Â - unless you are involved in illicit activities. Tijuana may be going through
some rough times, but she still has grit and pluck and I’ve learned from my experiences
travelling in troubled countries that the rewards usually far outweigh the risks. For an
example of that, read this story about Tijuana’s vibrant cultural scene.

For another analysis of the recent wave of drug violence, see this Los Angeles Time report .

Mexican drug traffickers have their own Space

Posted on August 14, 2008 | 8 Comments



Image:
http://acrosstheborder.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/picture-1.png?w=500&h=405



Almost everyone has a web site these days. That includes – so it seems – Â the Arellano
Felix drug cartel family.

I stumbled across this page recently. It has the domain name of miguelfelixgallardo.com .
Miguel Felix Gallardo was an older relative of the Arellano Felix brothers,Â according to
U.S. and Mexican reports. Â Miguel Felix Gallardo, Â said to be a major cartel leader in
the 1980s, Â remains in a Mexican prison since 1989. Ramon and Benjamin Arellano Felix took
over the Baja California portion of the business around that time, but in recent years the
Arellano clan and their associates have been getting arrested and killed. The web site claims
to be maintained by the remaining Felix family: “The reason and objective is to let others
know the health condition of our father, uncle, brother, friend and grandfather
Miguel.”Â 

The site includes a biography (under construction) of Miguel Felix Gallardo, photos, and a
forum where someone claiming to be Miguel Felix Gallardo responds to questions such as
“what do you think of the narco corridos that have been written about you?” and “how can
criminal activities be stopped?” The answer to that one: Â More funding for sports and
education, and less salaries for government officials.

I’ve seen and heard a lot of strange things in Tijuana and this one begs the question: Is it
quasi-real? Has it been set up by investigators as a trap? Is it a joke? In the murky underworld
here it can be hard to say for sure – but who’s to argue Miguel Felix Gallardo looks pretty
jaunty on that motorcycle.
