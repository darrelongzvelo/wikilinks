Main Street

    

    - Walk over to the Clockwork Cantina and complete the gear puzzle. Place the two brown
    gears on the ends and the three blue gears go in the middle. Turn the crank when
    theyâ€™re all in place. Now pick up the  Multi-Tool  that just appeared on the
    ground.

    

    - Now walk to the right and youâ€™ll see a garbage bin. Jump up on it to get the  Steam
    Battery .

    

    - Walk to the right again and go inside the Museum. Run to the right and youâ€™ll see a
    big yellow machine. Click on the blue lever to raise the arm. Then jump up on the platforms
    and make your way to the upper-right corner. Watch out for the darker platforms which will
    crumble and fall when you step on them. Grab the  dirty beaker  out of the display case in
    top right. Then exit the museum.

    

    - Go back to the Clockwork Cantina. Jump up and click on the blue lever here. A mechanical
    ramp will extend. Run up it and then jump onto the steam chutes to fly up and over the tower.
    You should land on top of a glass dome. Use your multi-tool to open it and then go down
    inside.

    

    - Youâ€™re now inside the Mayorâ€™s office. Check out the painting and the
    note on the typewriter, which give you an important number to remember for later:  0516 .
    Leave the office, jump back down to the street and run to the left to enter the next zone.

    



Gear Alley

    

    - Pass by Sullyâ€™s shop and go to the blue building in the middle. This is the living
    quarters. Jump up the platforms on the left side and then run past the door. Youâ€™ll
    see a  robot crab  here. Jump up and land on top of him to make him bounce and flip over.
    When he does, heâ€™ll drop  Sullyâ€™s key . Pick up both the key and the robot
    crab.

    

    - Drop down to the street and go to the next building on the left. Jump up on to the steam chute
    and leap up to the roof. Youâ€™ll find an  old vine  here. Pick it up to place it in
    your backpack.

    

    - Run to the right until you get in front of Sullyâ€™s Steam Powered Paraphernalia
    store. Thereâ€™s a Steam Terminal here. Use the steam battery in your backpack.
    Youâ€™ll get a puzzle here where you have to regulate the steam pressure in the
    terminal. The starting pressure is 10 and the ending pressure needs to be 5. You need to
    adjust the valves so that the pressure will lose five points as it travels to the end.

    



Sullyâ€™s Shop

    

    - Once you get inside Sullyâ€™s youâ€™ll find a robot in the right corner.
    Itâ€™s  Sprocket ! Ring the bell on the desk next to him to wake him up. Then go pick up
    the  rubber mallet  from the junk box in the left corner.

    

    - Leave Sullyâ€™s and Sprocket will follow you. If you click on him you can ask him
    some questions. Heâ€™s not very talkative right now but youâ€™ll hear a lot
    more from him later.

    

    - Head to the right to return to Main Street. Run all the way to the right side and then
    proceed onto the next zone, known as the Hub.

    



The Hub

    

    - When you arrive in the Hub, run along the ramp until you get to a metal hatch that is glowing
    red-hot. If you try to click it, youâ€™ll see itâ€™s much too hot to touch. Walk
    up to it and use the robot crab in your backpack. Sprocket the robot will take it from you and
    then drop the poor crab on top of the hatch. The water from the robot will cool down the hatch
    so that you can open it up.

    

    - Go down the hatch. When you get to the bottom of the ladder, Sprocket will look pretty
    scared. Make your way down the pipes until you run into a plant monster living inside them.
    Use the old vine from your backpack underneath the sign that says,  Caution: Hot Steam .
    This will spray steam onto the plant monster and kill it. Move along to the bottom left of
    the room and youâ€™ll find the bottom of an elevator. Click on the round hatch above.

    

    - Now youâ€™ll need to solve three levels of a ball tilt maze game thatâ€™s a lot
    like the classic wooden box  Labyrinth game . Spin the wheel either clockwise or
    counter-clockwise with your cursor to get the ball to the center. After you complete all
    three levels, the elevator will power up.

    

    - Go back up out of this area to the street. Go a few steps to the right and jump up onto the
    spring. After three jumps, you should land up next to another blue lever. Click the lever
    and the giant Hub wheel will start to move.

    

    - Go back down onto the street and run to the left. Jump up and grab the vines and climb up to a
    platform. Wait for the moving platform on the Hub wheel to come around and then jump onto
    it. Then jump off in the upper right corner (aim for the yellow pipe). Walk to the right and
    use the steam valve to jump up and to the left. Continue moving until you get to the elevator
    entrance to the Captainâ€™s Cabin. Then go inside.

    

    - A soon as you enter, Sprocket will be captured by some plant vines. Go down and click on the
    metal window shutters to snap the vines and free him. When you do, heâ€™ll speak to
    you for the first time and say, â€œThank you.â€� Now you can talk to him and ask
    him questions and hear his story.

    

    - Run to the right and use the moving platforms to get up to the large painting. Itâ€™s
    a copy of the painting you saw in the mayorâ€™s office.

    

    - Click on the dial at the bottom of the picture. This is a combination lock. The
    combination is the number from the mayorâ€™s office: 0516. Starting with the
    innermost ring, click on each triangle to get the wheel to spin. Then click on it again when
    itâ€™s pointing to the right number. The rings get faster so this can be tricky.

    

    - When you get the combination right, a secret door will open. Go inside and youâ€™ll
    be in Captain Ziggsâ€™ room. Go to the left and pick up the  bridge key  (on the
    floor) and the  Weed Whacker  (up on the wall). Then leave the room.

    

    - Go down and to the right and jump off the patio to return to the Hub zone. Go right until you
    get to the Steam Terminal at the end. Use the steam battery and then solve the puzzle.
    Itâ€™s just like the first one, but now you need to adjust the pressure from 10 to 16
    (+6). Once youâ€™re successful, the bridge will lower and you can run across.

    



Production Zone

    

    - Take a few steps to the right and jump on the spring to get to the platform above.
    Thereâ€™s a control panel here with three red levers and a green button. Move all the
    levers to the down position and then press the green button. The giant wrecking ball will
    drop and hit the ground, creating a hole.

    



Factory

    

    - Jump down and go through the hole. Make your way down and to the right and youâ€™ll
    enter a mechanical room. First, press the three red pressure pads on each side of the
    machine. Then youâ€™ll need to press the two remaining pads (the ones on the
    machine) at the same time. Sprocket will offer to hold down one while you get the other.

    

    - The machine will turn on and the moving platforms above will start turning. Use this to
    get up to the top of the room. Thereâ€™s a lever on the left wall. Click it to get
    another platform to move up and down. Then jump up to the right and use the platforms and
    vines to get to a moving conveyer belt. Here youâ€™ll need to avoid blobs that drop
    from a plant monster.

    

    - Continue across the vines and soon youâ€™ll find the  Mech Steam Motor , one of two
    parts youâ€™ll need to repair the Mech in Sullyâ€™s shop garage. Continue up
    on the vines and go up to the Greenhouse.

    



Greenhouse

    

    - Walk to the left and youâ€™ll find an area for mixing Herbicide. Pay attention to
    the chart on the wall. Use the dirty beaker from your backpack and then fill it with three
    parts blue, two parts green and four parts red. When youâ€™re done, youâ€™ll
    have some  Herbicide Mixture .

    

    - Go to the right and then up to the platform above. Use the herbicide on the plant monster.
    It will shrink and disappear, revealing a maintenance closet. Go inside.

    

    - Thereâ€™s an old custodian robot here. Heâ€™s holding onto the  Living
    Quarters Access Key . Take it from him and then heâ€™ll wake up and the alarm system
    will go off. You canâ€™t leave the way you came because the security system has a
    pressure hose that knocks you back. This is where I got stuck on this walkthrough. Special
    thanks to  DR3  from the PoptropicaSecrets.com community who provided the next step.

    

    - Go back out of the maintenance closet and then climb the vines above. Go to the left and
    youâ€™ll see that the glass dome has some tiny white cracks here. Use the rubber
    mallet from your backpack to smash a hole in the dome and escape.

    

    - Now run all the way back to Gear Alley, which is on the left of Main Street.

    



Gear Alley Redux

    

    - When you arrive, go to the bottom of the living quarters building (blue) and jump on the
    right platform of the lever on the gear. This will raise the one on the left.

    

    - Take a few steps to the left, then jump up the platforms to arrive at the doorway to the
    living quarters. Use your steam battery on the terminal and then solve the steam valve
    puzzle again. This time, you need to adjust the steam by -3 to get it from 10 to 7. The door
    will open. Go inside.

    



Living Quarters

    

    - Go click on the blue lever on the left to make the platform rise. Use it to get up to the next
    level and continue making your way up. Jump on the blue button on the floor to make the
    ladder rise. Youâ€™ll need to quickly jump up the ladder because it falls back down a
    second or two later. When you get to the top left, thereâ€™s another door leading to
    Zackâ€™s room. Go through it.

    



Zackâ€™s Room

    

    - Go up to the top left corner and click on the wall to solve the next puzzle, which is a timed
    game where you have to get the steam to move safely from one corner to the other. You must
    click on the squares to reveal pipes underneath and then swap the pipes around to create a
    clear path. There are three levels to get through.

    

    - Go outside and then cross over the vine that acts as a tightrope all the way to the left,
    where youâ€™ll find the Mech Crank  which is the second piece you need to repair the
    Mech in Sullyâ€™s Garage.

    

    - Jump down to the street below and then go to Sullyâ€™s Garage.

    



Sullyâ€™s Garage

    

    - Use both the Mech Crank and the Steam Motor from your backpack on the Mech. It will be
    repaired and now you can walk around in the Mech. Is this the  coolest thing ever  in
    Poptropica or what? Youâ€™ll also get a teleporter device that you can use to
    instantly travel back to the Mech from anywhere you go on Steamworks.

    

    - Walking in the Mech, head out of the garage and over to the left. Thereâ€™s a big
    doorway covered by vines. Attach the weed whacker from your backpack to the Mech and then
    use the spacebar to smash all the vines. Go through the door when itâ€™s clear.

    



Storage Room

    

    - Now youâ€™re inside a storage area. Make your way through, using the space bar to
    smash plant monsters that attack. At one point, youâ€™ll need to leave your Mech and
    power up one of the lifts. Then get back in the Mech and ride it up to the next platform.

    

    - Continue through this zone, killing plant monsters as you go until you get to the final
    plant monster in the room and get rid of him. Go through the doorway to the next zone.

    



Wind Zone

    

    - Go down the ramp to the left and youâ€™ll find a giant windmill. Walk all the way up to
    the blades and then Sprocket will offer to help.

    

    - Exit the Mech and stand on the blades as they spin to ride almost to the top. Then jump onto
    the platform above. Use your multi-tool to stop the blades. Sprocket will open the door.

    

    - Get back in the Mech and go through the doorway.

    



Hibernation Center

    

    - And now we finally learn the secret of what happened to all the inhabitants of Steamworks
    Island. First, exit the Mech and go to the machine. Use the multi-tool on it and the room
    will light up.

    

    - Zack will emerge from hid hibernation chamber and he and Sprocket will be re-united. How
    sweet!

    

    - The mayor will also appear and tell you the story of what happened. Then youâ€™ll
    see and hear bumps from below. Thereâ€™s still work to be done.

    

    - Jump up to the platforms on the right and get the  Toxic Blaster . Then get back in your
    Mech and attach it.

    

    - Take the elevator down to the next zone.

    



Tunnel System

    

    - Move through the room and shoot down the attacking plants by aiming with the mouse and
    using the spacebar to fire. Kill all the plants.

    

    - You want to end up on the platform just above the floor. If you miss it, youâ€™ll need
    to stand on the bolt/screw thing and spin it to raise yourself up.

    

    - Thereâ€™s a moving platform here. Wait for it and then ride it across to the doorway
    and prepare for the final battleâ€Š

    



Plant Hive

    

    - Youâ€™re now in the final boss battle. There are three boss monsters to kill and to
    make things even tougher, acid starts to fill the room from below. If you touch the acid,
    you lose and have to start over. You only have a short time to defeat each boss monster.

    

    - The basic technique for all three monsters is to get up close enough so that they try to
    strike you with their heads. Itâ€™s kind of like the Hydra from  Mythology Island .
    When they do, you can shoot them, causing a splat. Each monster needs to be splatted three
    times and then it will disappear and you can move on. There are some basic moves for each
    monster: move into position so that he starts to attack, then duck and wait for his head to
    snap back, then shoot. For the second and third monsters, you need to avoid the seed pods
    and bombs they hurl at you. If youâ€™re still having problems with this, read my
    complete  Final Boss Cheats Guide for Steamworks , which has a step-by-step video.

    

    - After you defeat the final plant monster, youâ€™ll re-appear next to the mayor,
    who will present you with the island medallion. Congratulations!

    

The official Poptropica  Steamworks promo page  is also available and it has a short teaser
summary of the plot, which is as follows: The silence of empty streets welcomes you. Metal and
machines fill the lonely halls, and a growing mystery lurks behind a shroud of steam. Can you
uncover what happened to the inhabitants of this ancient island? Gear up for a steam-powered
adventure you will never forget!
