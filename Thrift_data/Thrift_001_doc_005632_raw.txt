Early life

See also: Bachchan family

Bachchan was born in Allahabad , Uttar Pradesh , in north central India. His father, Harivansh
Rai Bachchan , was a Hindi poet and his mother, Teji Bachchan , was a Sikh from Faisalabad (now in
Pakistan ). 6 Bachchan was initially named Inquilaab, inspired from the phrase made famous
during the Indian independence struggle, Inquilab Zindabad , which means "long live
revolution". However, at the suggestion of fellow poet Sumitranandan Pant , Harivansh Rai
changed the name to Amitabh which means, "the light that would never go off." Though his
surname was Shrivastava , his father had adopted the pen-name Bachchan (meaning
"child-like" in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all his works. It is with this
last name that Amitabh debuted in films, and, for all public purposes, it has become the
surname of all members of his family. Bachchan's father died in 2003 and his mother in 2007. 7

Amitabh is the elder of Harivansh Rai Bachchan's two sons, the second being Ajitabh. His
mother had a keen interest in theatre and had been offered a role in a film, but preferred her
domestic duties. She had some degree of influence in Bachchan's choice of career because she
always insisted that he should take the centre stage. 8

Career



Early work: 1969â€“1972



Bachchan made his film debut in 1969 as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen 's National Award winning
film Bhuvan Shome . Thereafter he got his first acting role as one of the seven protagonists in
Saat Hindustani , a film directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal Dutt , Madhu and
Jalal Agha . Though the film was not a financial success, Bachchan won his first National Film
Award for Best Newcomer. 9

Anand (1971) followed, where he starred alongside Rajesh Khanna . Bachchan's role as a doctor
with a cynical view of life garned him his first Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award . He then
played his first negative role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in Parwaana (1971).
This was followed by several films including Reshma Aur Shera (1971). During this time, he
made a guest appearance in the film Guddi which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri . He
narrated part of the film Bawarchi . In 1972, he made an appearance in the road action comedy
Bombay to Goa , directed by S. Ramanathan . Many of his films during this early period did not do
well, but that was about to change. 10

Rise to stardom: 1973â€“1983



Director Prakash Mehra cast him in the leading role for the film Zanjeer (1973) as Inspector
Vijay Khanna. The film was a sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had
generally preceded it and established Amitabh in a new personaâ€”the "angry young man"
of Bollywood cinema. 2 He earned a Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. Filmfare considers
this one of the iconic performances of Bollywood history. 10 The year 1973 was also when he
married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together; not only in
Zanjeer but in films such as Abhimaan which followed and was released only a month after their
marriage. Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram in the film Namak Haraam , a social drama
directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of
friendship. His supporting role won him his second Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award .

Bachchan in Deewar .

In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as Kunwara Baap and Dost ,
before playing a supporting role in Roti Kapda Aur Makaan . The film, directed and written by
Manoj Kumar , addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and
emotional hardship. Bachchan then played the leading role in film Majboor , released on 6
December 1974, which was a remake of the Hollywood film Zigzag . The film was only a moderate
success at the box office. 11 In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres from the comedy
Chupke Chupke , the crime drama Faraar to the romantic drama Mili . 1975 was the year when he
appeared in two films which are regarded as important in Hindi cinematic history. He starred
in the Yash Chopra directed film Deewaar , opposite Shashi Kapoor , Nirupa Roy , and Neetu Singh
, which earned him a Filmfare Nomination for Best Actor. The film became a major hit at the box
office in 1975, ranking in at number 4. 12 Indiatimes Movies ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25
Must See Bollywood Films . 13 Released on 15 August 1975 was Sholay (meaning flames), which
became the highest grossing film of all time in India, earning INR 2,36,45,00,000 equivalent
to US$ 60 million, after adjusting for inflation . 14 Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. In
1999, BBC India declared it the "Film of the Millennium" and like Deewar , has been cited by
Indiatimes movies as amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films . 13 In that same year, the
judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award
called Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years .

Bachchan starred in comedies such as Chupke Chupke (1975) and Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) and in
films such as Kabhie Kabhie (1976). In 1976, he was once again cast by director Yash Chopra in
his second film, Kabhi Kabhie , a romantic tale in which Bachchan starred as a young poet named
Amit Malhotra who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja played by
actress Raakhee . The film saw him again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award. In 1977,
he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Amar Akbar Anthony where he
played the third lead opposite Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor as Anthony Gonsalves. In 1978 he
starred in all four of the highest grossing films of India in that year. 15 He once again resumed
double roles in films such as Kasme Vaade as Amit and Shankar and Don playing the characters of
Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look alike Vijay. His performance won him his second
Filmfare Best Actor Award . He also performed in Trishul and Muqaddar Ka Sikandar which both
earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. He was billed a "one-man industry" by the
French director FranÃ§ois Truffaut . 16

In 1979, for the first time, Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the film Mr.
Natwarlal in which he starred alongside Rekha . His performance in the film saw him nominated
for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the Filmfare Best Male Playback Awards . In 1979, he
also received Best Actor nomination for Kaala Patthar (1979) and then went on to be nominated
again in 1980 for the Raj Khosla directed film Dostana , in which he starred opposite
Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman . Dostana proved to be the top grossing film of 1980. 17 In
1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film Silsila , where he starred alongside his wife
Jaya and rumoured lover Rekha . Other films of this period include Ram Balram (1980), Shaan
(1980), Lawaaris (1981), and Shakti (1982) which pitted him against legendary actor Dilip
Kumar . 18

1982 injury while filming Coolie



On 26 July 1982, while filming Coolie in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan
suffered a near fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor
Puneet Issar . 19 Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him
to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However as he jumped towards the table, the corner of
the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic rupture from which he lost a significant
amount of blood. He required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in
hospital for many months, at times close to death. The public response included prayers in
temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of
well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating. 20 Nevertheless, he spent
many months recovering and resumed filming later that year after a long period of
recuperation. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of
Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success. 21

The director, Manmohan Desai , altered the ending of Coolie after Bachchan's accident.
Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of
script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the
man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film
the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen
marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident. 20

Later, he was diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis . His illness made him feel weak both mentally
and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. At this time he became
pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received and stated before every
release, "Yeh film to flop hogi!" ("This film will flop"). 22

Politics: 1984â€“87



In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of
long-time family friend, Rajiv Gandhi . He contested Allahabad's seat of 8th Lok Sabha
against H. N. Bahuguna , former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and won by one of the highest
victory margins in general election history (68.2% of the vote). 23 His political career,
however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a cesspool . The
resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the " Bofors scandal " by a
newspaper, which he vowed to take to court. Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of
involvement in the ordeal. 24

His old friend, Amar Singh , helped him during a financial crisis due to the failure of his
company ABCL. Therefore Bachchan started to support Amar Singh's political party, the
Samajwadi party. Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi Party and became a Rajya Sabha member. 25
Bachchan has continued to do favors for the Samajwadi party, including advertisements and
political campaigns. These activities have recently gotten him into trouble again in the
Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him,
stating that he is a farmer. 26

A 15 year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by Stardust and
some of the other film magazines. In his own defense, Bachchan claimed to have banned the press
from entering his sets until late 1989. 27

Slump and retirement: 1988â€“1992



In 1988, Bachchan returned to films, playing the title role in Shahenshah , which was a box
office success due to the hype of Bachchan's comeback. 28 After the success of his comeback
film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films failed at the box
office. The 1991 hit film, Hum , for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award , looked
like it might reverse this trend, but the momentum was short-lived as his string of box office
failures continued. Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this period that
Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor , for his performance as a Mafia don in
the 1990 film Agneepath . These years would be the last he would be seen on screen for some time.
After the release of Khuda Gawah in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years.
In 1994, one of his delayed films Insaniyat was released but was also a box office failure. 29

Producer and acting comeback 1996â€“99



Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up Amitabh
Bachchan Corporation , Ltd. (A.B.C.L.) in 1996, with the vision of becoming a 10 billion
rupees (approx 250 million $US) premier entertainment company by the year 2000. ABCL's
strategy was to introduce products and services covering the entire section of the India's
entertainment industry. Its operations were mainstream commercial film production and
distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television
software, celebrity and event management. Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the
first film was produced by the company. Tere Mere Sapne failed to do well at the box office but
launched the careers of actors such as Arshad Warsi and South films star Simran . ABCL produced
a few other films, none of which did well.

In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film Mrityudata , produced by
ABCL. Though Mrityudaata attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero,
the film was a failure both financially and critically. ABCL was the main sponsor of the 1996
Miss World beauty pageant , Bangalore but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal
battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that
ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top level managers, eventually led to its
financial and operational collapse in 1997. The company went into administration and was
later declared a failed company by Indian Industries board. The Bombay high court, in April
1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay bungalow 'Prateeksha' and two flats
till the pending loan recovery cases of Canara Bank were disposed of. Bachchan had, however,
pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to Sahara India Finance for raising funds for his
company. 30

Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career and had average success with Bade Miyan Chote
Miyan (1998), 29 and received positive reviews for Sooryavansham (1999) 31 but other films
such as Lal Baadshah (1999) and Hindustan Ki Kasam (1999) were box office failures.

Return to prominence: 2000â€“present

Bachchan at the IIFA Awards in 2006

In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in Yash Chopra 's box-office hit, Mohabbatein , directed
by Aditya Chopra . He played a stern, older figure that rivalled the character of Shahrukh Khan
. His role won him his third Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award . Other hits followed, with
Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love (2001), Kabhi
Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Baghban (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a
range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in Aks (2001), Aankhen
(2002), Khakee (2004) and Dev (2004). One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was
Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's Black (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an aging teacher of a
deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised
by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor and fourth
Filmfare Best Actor Award . Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a
variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard
advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the hit films Bunty Aur
Babli (2005), the Godfather tribute Sarkar (2005), and Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna (2006). All of
them were successful at the box office. 32 33 His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were
Baabul (2006), 34 Ekalavya and Nishabd (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his
performances in each of them were praised by critics. 35

In May 2007, two of his films Cheeni Kum and the multi-starrer Shootout at Lokhandwala were
released. Shootout at Lokhandwala did very well at the box office and was declared a hit in
India, while Cheeni Kum picked up after a slow start and only had average success. 36 A remake of
his biggest hit, Sholay (1975), entitled Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag , released in August of that
same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical
reception. 36 The year also marked Bachchan's first appearance in an English-language film,
Rituparno Ghosh 's The Last Lear . The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film
Festival on 9 September 2007. He received positive reviews from critics who hailed his
performance as his best ever since Black . 37 Bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in
his first international film, Shantaram , directed by Mira Nair and starring Hollywood actor
Johnny Depp in the lead. The film was due to begin filming in February 2008 but due to the
writer's strike, was pushed to September 2008. 38 The film is currently "shelved"
indefinitely. 39 Vivek Sharma 's Bhoothnath , in which he plays the title role as a ghost , was
released on 9 May 2008. Sarkar Raj , the sequel of the 2005 film Sarkar , released in June 2008 and
received a positive response at the box-office. Paa , which released at the end of 2009 was a
highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son Abhishek's Progeria-affected
13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards Bachchan's
performance. It won him his third National Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Best
Actor Award . In 2010, he debuted in Malayalam film through Kandahar , directed by Major Ravi
and co-starring Mohanlal . 40 The film was based on the hijacking incident of the Indian
Airlines Flight 814 . 41 Bachchan did not receive any remuneration for this film. 42

Television career



In the year 2000, Bachchan stepped up to host India's adaptation of the British television
game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? entitled, Kaun Banega Crorepati . As it did in most
other countries where it was adopted, the program found immediate success. He has hosted all
but one of the seasons of the show. Canara Bank withdrew its law suit against Bachchan in
November 2000. Bachchan hosted KBC till November 2005, when he fell ill. At that time he was
admitted to Lilavati Hospital 's ICU once more, to undergo surgery for diverticulitis of the
small intestine . 43 During the period and that following his recovery, most of his projects
were put on hold, including KBC . 44 The show's success set the stage for his return to film
popularity. In 2009 Oscar winning movie Slumdog Millionaire in the first question of Who
Wants to be a Millionaire? contest "Amitabh Bachchan" was the correct answer to the question
"Who was the star of Zanjeer ? Feroz Abbas Khan performed as Amitabh Bachchan in a scene in the
movie while Anil Kapoor performed as the host of the contest. Bachchan hosted the third season
of the reality show Bigg Boss in 2009. 45

Barabanki land case



In the runup to the Uttar Pradesh state assembly elections, 2007 , Bachchan made a film
extolling the virtues of the Mulayam Singh government. His Samajwadi Party was routed, and
Mayawati came to power. citation needed

On 2 June 2007 a Faizabad court ruled that he had legally acquired agricultural land
designated specifically for landless Dalit farmers. 48 It was speculated that he might be
investigated on related charges of forgery , as he has allegedly claimed he was a farmer. 49 On
19 July 2007, after the scandal broke out, Bachchan surrendered the land acquired in
Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh and Pune . He wrote to the chief minister of Maharashtra , Vilasrao
Deshmukh, to donate the lands that were allegedly acquired illegally in Pune. 50 However, the
Lucknow Court has put a stay on the land donation and said that the status quo on the land be
maintained.

On 12 October 2007, Bachchan abandoned his claim in respect of the land at Daulatpur village in
Barabanki district . 51 On 11 December 2007, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court gave
a clean chit to Bachchan in a case pertaining to alleged fraudulent allotment of government
land to him in Barabanki district. A single Lucknow bench of Justice said there was no finding
that the actor "himself committed any fraud or manipulated any surreptitious entry in the
revenue records". 52 53

After receiving a positive verdict in Barabanki case, Amitabh Bachchan intimated to
Maharashtra government that he did not wish to surrender his land in Maval tehsil of Pune
district. 54

Bachchan featured on an advert in shopping mall in India

In January 2008 at political rallies, Raj Thackeray , the chief of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena
, targeted Amitabh Bachchan, asserting that the actor was "more inclined" towards his native
state than Maharashtra. He expressed his disapproval of Amitabh's inaugurating a girls'
school named after his daughter-in-law, actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan , at Barabanki in
Uttar Pradesh, rather than in Maharashtra. 55 According to media reports, Raj's censure of
Amitabh, whom he admires, stemmed out of his disappointment of not being invited to Amitabh's
son Abhishek 's marriage to Aishwarya, despite invitations to his estranged uncle Bal and
cousin Uddhav. 56 57

Responding to Raj's accusations, the actor's wife, SP MP Jaya Bachchan, said that the
Bachchans were willing to start a school in Mumbai, provided the MNS leader donated the land to
build it. She told the media, "I heard that Raj Thackeray owns huge properties in Maharashtra,
in Mumbaiâ€”Kohinoor Mills. If he is willing to donate land, we can start a school in the
name of Aishwarya here." 58 Raj responded to it saying, "Jaya bachchan claims she does not know
me then how come she knows how much property I own?". Amitabh abstained from commenting on the
issue. However, he apologized to Raj for controversial remarks from Jaya in some other
incidence. " 59

Bal Thackeray refuted the allegations, stating, "Amitabh Bachchan is an open-minded
person, he has great love for Maharashtra, and this is evident on many occasions. The actor has
often said that Maharashtra and specially Mumbai has given him great fame and affection. He
has also said that what he is today is because of the love people have given him. citation needed
The people of Mumbai have always acknowledged him as an artiste. citation needed It was utter
foolishness to make these parochial allegations against him. Amitabh is a global superstar.
People all over the world respect him. This cannot be forgotten by anyone. Amitabh should
ignore these silly accusations and concentrate on his acting." 60

On 23 March 2008, more than a month and half after Raj's remarks, Amitabh finally spoke out in an
interview to a local tabloid saying, "Random charges are random; they do not deserve the kind
of attention you wish me to give." 61 Later, on 28 March at a press conference for the
International Indian Film Academy , when asked what his take was on the anti-migrant issue,
Amitabh said that it is one's fundamental right to live anywhere in the country and the
constitution entitles so. 62 He also stated that he was not affected by Raj's comments. 63

online poll. The organisation noted that "Many people in the western world will not have heard

was honoured with the Actor of the Century award at the Alexandria International Film
Festival in Egypt in recognition of his contribution to the world of cinema. 69 Many other
honours for his achievements were conferred upon him at several International Film
