More Tentative Than Resolute



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4nCQdxzS_vo/Tv5UjROKnwI/AAAAAAAAAvw/2VISKTMZrog/s320/wikipedia+woman+writing+Lesser+Ury+Frau+am+Schreibtisch+1898.jpg
’Tis the time to turn attention to that most traditional of traditions, the making of New
Year Resolutions—and yet, I hesitate. I hesitate because, having learnt from experience,
I habitually fail to do that for which I put my most earnest energy declaring ’twill be so.

And yet, it is admirable to peruse those declarations when coming from the mouths of others.
Many write in such glowing terms about their intentions that I nearly feel compelled to stand
to my feet and shout out a fervent “hurrah!” for their noble plans.

Having succumbed to such calendar-conquering attempts in my past, I’ve since been
persuaded to adopt the sage advice of the Apostle James, who in near-antiquity warned :

“Now listen, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year
there, carry on business and make money.’ Why, you do not even know what will happen
tomorrow.”

At least I can vouch for that—not much further than the week before Christmas, I wouldn’t
have been able to tell you that I’m about to board a plane to visit a cousin who is unexpectedly
facing her last moments of battling cancer. Who would have known when she presided at her
daughter’s wedding less than six months ago? Who even expected such a trip a month ago?

So I learn to be circumspect about this calendar thing. How can I say with certainty what I will
accomplish in 2012?

And yet, I can dream. Not pie-in-the-sky dreams, mind you, nor the carefully-calculated
“dreams” called in the business world “ goals ” or in the mom-at-home world “to-do
lists.” I’ll take my dream inspiration from the type of star-following journey of some
wise men long ago. They took their cue from a specific star: following it as long as it was
moving, but having the good sense to stop when it hovered and to then seek further direction
from details closer at hand.

And so, on this starry (somewhere!) eve, here are my New Year’s Tentativities.

First of all: For all the blessings, help and encouragement I’ve received along my way, I
wish to give back. I’ll start this promptly with a New Year’s Day greeting of gratefulness
on my first post in January. I’ll follow up with some action to support my words by
volunteering to help make more archived source documents available online for the
genealogy-searching public. I’ve already started on this one by indexing for
FamilySearch.org on records I’ve wanted to see online (Catholic Church records in
Chicago, for instance) and for local goodwill (our county’s Genealogy Society’s joint
project with FamilySearch.org to make our county’s obituary notices available online for
all). Thanks to a blog I frequent , I see that a county my Stevens line claimed as home in the 1850s
has yet to be indexed for its marriage records, and it will be a simple matter for me to join the
fun there, as well as to discover other indexing projects as my time allows through the rest of
the year.

Second, I want to pick up some loose threads from my wish list for 2011, and pursue family
history details for some potentially historically-significant family members in my
McClellan line in Florida. I’ve received an e-mail from a reader with some details about
this family and I can hardly stand the wait to blog about it. I also want to fulfill my wish to
write up some of that data for a Wikipedia entry that is currently a mere stub for lack of willing
writers to elaborate on the topic.

Third, of course, I want to continue unfolding the accumulated hundred-year-old
memorabilia I acquired about the Chicago Tully and Stevens family and related lines. Believe
me, there is much more to cover, and though I have much of the raw data on hand, it will require
quite a bit of background research to round out. That journey will take us through some
post-World War II adventures, then step back in time to explore a branch of the family that,
through a story-book courtship and wedding, brings us from Chicago to rural Ohio. It will
include exploration of young ladies’ letter writing ministries of encouragement for the
seriously ill during those times of isolation before health-restoring and life-giving
medicines. And it will eventually bring me back, squarely face-to-face with the Tully brick
wall that keeps me from addressing our roots in Ireland.

Finally—and this is my grandest, though most timorously-voiced goal—I wish to further
organize this material as part of a book to be written for our business. That book will provide
the background story for a message my husband has been giving to teenagers over the last decade
on valuing their own life enough to comprehend its impact on others—especially if it were
carelessly tossed aside. That presentation has grown out of my husband’s own life message
and leaves an indelible mark wherever he has spoken. We are hoping a book which encapsulates
this message will enable him to reach even more young people.

Dreams? Yes.

Achievable? Possibly—although I can’t vouch for my ability to be task-driven and
focused at all times. (I tend to side with Lorine McGinnis Schulze of Olive Tree Genealogy when
it comes to “frenetic.” And I’m okay with that.)

But as a friend of mine once reminded me when I considered, at my age, going back to college for
another degree: at the end of the year, whether I do this or not, it will still be the end of
another year. Why not make it count?

Cat Genealogy and Dog Tags

Sitting here at my keyboard, having just finished the series of World War II era letters from my
father-in-law, Francis X. Stevens , I could possibly succumb to a sense of driftlessness.
After all, the point of the series has nicely come to a close and, wrapping it up, I now can be
permitted to roam through a wide open field of possible next topics. The mood is
mellow—after all, it is that wonderful holiday lull between Christmas Day and New Year’s
Day—and I am accompanied loyally by my ever-present feline companion. What more could I
ask, slipping up to the eve of a New Year, for a pressure-free moment to select this blog’s
next direction?



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AgvWl96iB14/Tv1bJVK35eI/AAAAAAAAAvY/vhTzMYmv1iY/s320/Luke+the+Narnia+Kitten.jpg
Said feline companion can even provide inspiration for my next move. He, making his online
debut as Luke the Narnia Kitty, has seen his career trajectory rocket to self-fancied
position of Senior Editor of A Family Tapestry in short order. Yet for all his illustrious
accomplishments in life, he hails from a mere commoner’s background. There is no paper
trail at any FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale FÃ©line to document his genealogy—nor,
alas, any mention at the more plebian American Cat Fanciers Association . Truth be told,
though his accomplishments are impressive, he is only the great-grandchild of a humble jail
cat, a domestic short-hair rescued from G Barracks at the County Honor Farm. Beyond that brief
familial history lies genealogical research’s proverbial brick wall.

And with that, we pause for Luke’s sake to contemplate the unfairness of life which doles
honors upon, and which prefers recognition of, Blue Bloods and Silver Spoons.

Perhaps, if the talented and literarily-refined Luke* had been more like his arch
nemesis—Folly*, the household’s carefree Sealyham Terrier —he would have been more
fortunate in his genealogical pursuits, for Folly is represented by a constituency boasting
interest in such matters. You see, Folly (as well as her predecessor—and distant cousin, by
the way—Ego*) simply need do no more than contact her representative at the American Kennel
Club to certify her lineage. Should she have cared to do so, she could produce documentation
linking her all the way back to the line’s origin in those first generations in Wales in the
mid 1800s.

It does seem that the all-important link to a constituency with a vested interest in
preserving vital documentation is key to being able to persevere in family history research.
I know that, in my family’s case, if it weren’t for government records such as birth and
death certificates or religious documentation in church organizations for which such
information bears eternal significance, I would have precious few resources from which to
glean the slightest inkling about my ancestors. I would be no better off than my feline friend
Luke—who is, after all, merely of a common domestic sort. Without such organizations
providing genealogical resources, I would find myself, too, resigned to Cat Genealogy.

And in the case of Frank Stevens, a Chicago boy in the 1940s who is also of a mere common domestic
variety, I am fortunate that he, too, is part of a constituency for which record-keeping holds
a high importance. He became part of a military organization from which I can extract many more
records than his doting mother ever thought to tuck away in her dresser drawer.

In Frank’s case, I can access his Official Military Personnel File from the National
Personnel Records Center in Saint Louis, the designated branch of the National Archives
tasked with delivering these files . With an online application , followed by a faxed copy of
the appropriate next-of-kin’s signature, and a wait of about ninety days, I will become
another recipient benefiting from being part of a constituency for whom record-keeping is
highly valued. In accessing Frank Stevens’ military records, our family will then step
from the breed of unrecognized domestic commoners—the realm of Cat Genealogy—into the
streamlined research world of institutional documentation, for which I will be able to show
much more than just his “dog tags.”

And for this New Year’s Eve’s eve, that sounds like a likely resolution to add to my list.

*As a literary postscript, it might be of interest to note the source of each of these monikers.
Luke is the namesake of Luke Skywalker of Star Wars . Folly's name is inspired by the original
story of 101 Dalmatians . Ego took his name from a line of a poem attributed to Friedrich
Nietzsche ("I go through life followed by a dog known as Ego") which I heard set to music in an a
cappella piece by Lars-Erik Larsson—having once heard, I was, of course, obligated to
follow suit. How much each of these personas may be adapted to illustrate types of genealogy
researchers might be an interesting diversion to contemplate on a New Year's Eve....

Just An Orphan Sailor



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lJH0x2rMsLs/TvwFecAhDYI/AAAAAAAAAvA/qOEdvsXJfQk/s1600/Frank+Stevens+home+on+leave+fr+Navy++-+cropped.jpg
Now that Frank Stevens has returned home to Chicago from his tour of duty in the south Pacific
during World War II, and before we find out what is to happen to him next, we may as well take a look
at a piece of paper that was tucked into the envelope along with the letter to his parents dated
March 22, 1945. It is my guess, based on the mismatch of this paper with that of the actual
letter, that perhaps his mother mistakenly tucked this one into the wrong envelope for
safe-keeping.

Whatever the sequence may be, the sentiment on this page may represent Frank’s own
ambivalent response to his last few years’ experience aboard that lesser-known vessel
called the Landing Craft Infantry .

  U.S.S. LCI (L) 707 C/o. Fleet Post Office San Francisco , California

THE AMPHIBIOUS SAILOR

You’ve heard of the Air Force and the Paratroops, You’ve heard of the Army and other
groups, But think now as hard as you can, Have you ever heard of the Amphibious man.

The Amphibious gob is of real rugged sort, But unlike the fleet, He has no home port; Goes where
he is needed, does what he can, This poor orphan sailor, the Amphibious man.

You might be a Battleship sailor, from a Cruiser or off a Tin Can, Maybe fresh out of Boot
training, or perhaps a second cruise man, They pick the men at random, how else could they
provide, A few might choose the duty, but mostly they are shanghaied.

You’ve heard plenty of the navy, of ships both fore and aft, But we’ll bet you a pretty penny
you’ve never heard of Landing craft, They’ve built a few already and are building plenty
more, For they’ve got to have the LCI to win this blasted war.

They come in with the Transports in the middle of the night, Sail around to rendezvous, can’t
even show a light, Find their way in the darkness, and land upon the shore, Through bombs,
discharging their cargo and going back out for more.

Bringing in the first wave doesn’t end the job, For the troops upon the beach can’t live
without this gob. He brings in reinforcements and everything they use, His job is full of
danger but he never makes the news.

For when the beach is taken and the radios start to tell, You’ll hear of Marines and Soldiers
and how they went through Hell. You’ll thrill to front page stories of their heroic job, But
you’ll never hear a word of praise for the poor Amphibious Gob.

And when this war is over and he’s back in Civilian life, How in hell will he explain to his kids
and to his wife? They know he was in the Navy, but he’s the subject of a gyp, He’s just an
orphan Sailor - - -, A Gob without a Ship…….

Separation Anxiety



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Fncjquorf0o/TvlFogAyFeI/AAAAAAAAAuo/1_uWSlPwxq4/s1600/Frank+Stevens+home+on+leave+fr+Navy++-+cropped.jpg
For the last two months , I’ve been working my way through the collection of letters sent
during World War II by my father-in-law, Frank Stevens , to his parents, William and Agnes
Tully Stevens in Chicago. After the letter dated October 26, 1945 , I have no more letters from
Frank prior to his arrival home—and not that many letters after that point, either. I did
find some documents showing his intention to acquire further medical training while in the
service, but no indication as to whether his application was approved or denied. It did, at
least, indicate his intention to remain in the Navy.

But now I find a document showing his “date of separation” as December 21, 1945. That
leaves a very slim margin, indeed, for his hoped-for arrival in Chicago in time for Christmas
from his jumping off point at San Pedro, California . While a young man full of determination
can sometimes work miracles, this doesn’t explain what has become of his career plans.  
That date of separation leaves me quite perturbed. I, of course, know the rest of the
story—at least the gist of what is yet to come. But I don’t know the details of the hows and
whys. All I know at this point is that, despite evident hopes of further training in the field of
aviation medicine, Frank Stevens now has a piece of paper filled with bureaucratic words like
“separation” and “discharge.”

On To Better Things

It appears that Frank Stevens is now asking for additional training in the medical field in
which he is already serving—and that his Commanding Officer is endorsing his request. I
wonder if he has his cousin Joe McGonagle , fallen with the crew of his Flying Fortress over
Germany, in mind as he makes his request.

What Brings Frank Home



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bnR5wUsccL8/TvQoYWuvI2I/AAAAAAAAAsM/UyK0De7Ocg0/s1600/Frank+Stevens+home+on+leave+fr+Navy++-+cropped.jpg
Sometime after Christmas day, the weather clears up around Kansas City and Frank Stevens is
able to finish his long journey from somewhere out in the Pacific to the port of San Francisco
and across over half the country to finally arrive at his parents' new home in Chicago.



So what brings him home now? To reconstruct what must be happening in Frank's world, I have to
rely on some other documents, as I have (at least at this point) no more letters prior to
December 1945 from Frank. Come September, however, there is a memorandum issued by the
Medical Officer heading up the LCI group which includes Frank’s ship, recommending Frank
to the Chief of the Navy’s Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. In this now-postwar world, things
are starting to change, but Frank is evidently intending to continue in this military way of
life.

Guess Who’s On His Way Home?!



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dy-atAneLr8/TvTklR-sXMI/AAAAAAAAAts/IUzmYFieN4o/s1600/Frank+Stevens+home+on+leave+fr+Navy++-+cropped.jpg
After lots of false starts in the direction of home, after plenty of shattered hopes about
being home for his twenty-first birthday or even for Christmas, it looks like Frank Stevens
will indeed be able to run up the steps and “plant a smooch” on Will and Agnes Tully Stevens
on the front porch of their new home in Chicago. As anyone can imagine, Frank is ecstatic.



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CpGWI9l5bEA/TvTjzr3XABI/AAAAAAAAAtI/ivIachNkvAY/s400/19451026+letter+fr+Frank+Stevens+-+pg+1+-+cropped.jpg


                                             
October 26 th , 1945
                                             
Okinawa Shima (Island)
                                             
Ryukyu Rhetto (Chain of Islands) Dear Mom, Dad and All:             Received
Dad’s letter of the 16 th and Mom’s of the 18 th today. Very much relieved to hear that
everything is okay with Dad and the bunch. The news that Gerry is on the mend didn’t go bad
either, guess we’ve lots to thank the Lord for.             I’ve been using a
lot of penicillin lately Dad and I was told and later found out for myself that it is most
effective when given at three hour intervals, keeps it at a level that is most beneficial. We
have had quite a few ear infections in this area in the past few weeks and the wonder drug is
really doing a wonderful job in fact it surprised hell clean out of me.
            By the time you Folks get this I will be on my way HOME, don’t run and
look out the front window now cause it will be at least a month and a half before I run up the steps
to plant a smooch on all of you. Chances are good that I’ll be home for Christmas, can hardly
believe it myself but our skipper was ordered over to the port director’s office to pick up
our sailing orders within twenty four hours and though our first port can’t be told at
present we know it’s in the right direction. Guess you know that the crew is really all hipped
up about it, I’m a little cloud bound myself so if this doesn’t make sense just take it for
granted I’ve blown my top, slightly of course!!!!!!!!   Despite the excitement of the good
news, Frank always keeps in mind the health risks his dad has been facing lately. He is tempted
to make some contingency planning on his father’s behalf—anything to gain even a
minute’s advantage may be what saves his life. Frank is persistent in doing everything he
can to assuage any worries on his dad’s part. He’s adamant that any “reward” his mom
talks about "going on to" does not happen any time soon—especially any time before he can get
there to be with them, himself.

              Do you have to go to Mercy hospital Dad? How about the Evangelical?
Lots closer to home and a better neighborhood, suppose you are thinking about the cost?
            Don’t say another word about my giving you my dough as it’s not
mine, it’s ours and if it weren’t for Mom and Dad I wouldn’t be here to earn it so let’s
not hear any more about it, Okay?             I haven’t received the cable as
yet so call up the red cross and make with the Bronx cheer, that outfit is food for the birds as far
as I’m concerned anyway.             I was in Buckner bay for the first typhoon
and it was plenty rugged, for the second one we were up at the northern end of the island at a place
called Unten Ko, you have to go up a river to reach it and it is fairly well protected, had we been
in the main anchorage for the second one we could have scratched one LCI off of the navy
register, know we would have ended up on the reef. I’m pretty sure I’ve got a lot of the
Saints looking out for me otherwise I’d be a dead pigeon now. Wish I knew what Ship our cousin
Bill is on, he is very probably right up here at Buckner bay now.             I
never heard from John acknowledging receipt of my last money orders so I don’t even know
whether or not he received them, well I’ve got the stubs so I’m not going to worry about
them. Too bad that he has been ill, infections can be such nasty things.
            The news that Bill has been upped is swell, the kid rates the best and
that’s for sure. I’ve never met Sister Pat, think I would like to though, I’ve heard so
much about her, I wonder if Sister Attracta is still at Mercy?             I
don’t like Pat being on the night shift at work, the neighborhood isn’t the best to be out in
after dark, tell her I said to be careful.

  By the way, Pat owes me a letter, I thought I was the world’s worst letter writer and
procrastinator, she has the title and it’s unchalanged. Hope her jaw is better now and the
trouble mended. Is her boy friend home from the ETO as yet???????            
Quite a few of the original crew have left the ship and we have had boot replacements now, seem
like nice boys but all beat their gums because the[y] were taken so close to the end of the war of
course that makes me feel just grand and every time one of them opens his mouth I proceed to shut
it for him, I call them delayed 4F’s and it makes them very unhappy. They sit around and tell
about the big money they were making on the outside and then beat their teeth about the navy. One
of them told me the navy handed out too much crap and that on the outside he wouldn’t take it, on
the outside he was a foreman and he gave out all the guff so he said, So I told him that first he
isn’t on the outside any more, second I didn’t gave a damn what he was out there cause in here
he was just a boot and so green that we would have to hang him out to dry before we could burn him and
third the lad cleaning the head needed some help and I thought he was just the man for the job.
Since then he has been very cooperative and has ceased to flop his chops at least when I’m
around.             Well I’m going to bring this to a screeching halt and get in
a little sack time. By the way if any mail is delivered to the house for me please hold it for me and
don’t forward it.             So long for now all take care of yourselves and
keep writing.
                                             
Loads of love;
                                                    
Frank

P.S. Mom I hope that reward you all talking about is delayed 50 years or so.

Swell People and Tough Breaks





Image:

Always a people person, Frank Stevens rounds out his five page letter to his brother Ed and his
young wife in Chicago with comments about their mutual relatives—mostly siblings,
especially those whose darling babies are starting to take center stage around the old
Stevens household. Frank’s been gone from home so long that he has not actually met these
grandchildren of his dad and mom , but he sounds just as present in their lives as if he is right
there with them, instead of half a world away in the south Pacific.



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-48yv3v12HUg/TvQT5JzrTOI/AAAAAAAAAq4/Kw1AjH2yK34/s400/19450715+fr+Frank+Stevens+-+pg+4+-+cropped+2.jpg

            [One of Will and Agnes’ grandsons]  must be pretty good looking
with his hair cut like a boy’s, I believe he has a lot of the old nick in him—should turn into
quite a lady killer, make his uncle Ed look like an amateur. So me little god-daughter is a good
baby huh? Well she just takes after her uncle Frank, ask your mother in law I was the bestest baby
ever. Too bad I had to grow up. From Mom’s last letter it sounds as if the kid is allergic to damn
near everything, maybe he will snap out of it later on—of course mom always did baby him too
much and that might have a lot to do with the way he is now. His brother Frank is allergic to just
two things: wild women and Canadian club.

While Frank is running away from wedding bells as fast as he can, it sounds like plans may be
afoot for his sister, who has been writing a few letters, too.



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DJvEy7I18TQ/TvQUL1q1CdI/AAAAAAAAArE/26S3XQTlKPI/s400/19450715+fr+Frank+Stevens+-+pg+4+-+cropped+3.jpg

            Pat stops me, she never has known just what she want to do, that’s
just what she needs though—a house full of kids and a husband that doesn’t beat her too
often. Is the proposed victim that shavetail that has been over in Europe? Don’t know the lad
myself but I’ve heard that he is a pretty nice chap. Well Pat is a good kid and I hope she knows
what she’s doing, she’s sort of a feather-brained character though

I had to chuckle at the insight Frank had into his brother’s predicament in his new role as
father. And Frank remembers some relatives on Ed’s wife’s side and wants to keep in touch
with them, too.

I see that Dee-dee is now known as daddy Ed, guess he proved himself with the last addition.
Never knew Ed to go this long at any one stretch before without a car, incidently I hope that Pat
hasn’t thrown the clutch out on the Chevy as I’ve got a lot of running around to do when I get
home again.             The wash job that little [one of Ed’s children] gave
the house must have really been something, I trust that Ed (Daddy) had a man to man talk with the
offspring when he came home that night, it must be hell trying to bawl out a kid for doing the same
thing that you probably did yourself as a youngster. If that’s one of the thrills of being a
mother I for one am glad that I am physically incapable of becoming one, washing didies and
cleaning up after a three foot tornado aren’t my idea of a lot of fun. I’ve been meaning to
write to Tom and Elsie for quite some time, think I might get a letter off to them tonight, they
sure are swell people and I think a lot of them.

When Frank gets to this last part of his extraordinarily long letter, he touches on a subject
for which I had meant to provide more background information (and will in the Spring when we
move on to that side of the family). It is indeed a sad conclusion to a now many-months-old
story. And Frank awkwardly tries to inject some humor into a situation that perhaps hit him too
close to home for his personal comfort.

The young man, Joe, that Frank refers to here is a cousin serving in the Air Force (at that time,
part of the United States Army). Joe was part of the crews flying missions from England over
Germany. In 1944, Frank’s aunt and uncle in Ohio received word that their son was missing and
presumed dead—but evidently a search for confirmation was still being conducted. Yet one
sad additional part to the story was that Joe ’s young bride, Harriet , was expecting their
first child .

I’m not sure who told Frank the news about Joe, but considering Frank’s own situation in
the war at that time, it may have been just too difficult for him to take. One sometimes develops
a tough exterior to survive the waves of devastating news that keep hitting. That’s how
Frank sounds now as he awkwardly tries to cope with the confirmation about his cousin—the
news that the family now knows, at long last, what has become of Joe McGonagle.

            Kind of a tough break for Harriet but at least she knows that Joe is
really gone, did she lose her baby or did she finally have it? From the way Bill McGonagle talked
she is a pretty good looking girl. Ad. Stevens F. X. USN make a special study of young widows low
rates call after six. Really shouldn’t kid I guess but what the hell tears never fixed anyone
and a good time would probably make the kid feel a hundred percent better.
            Johnny just came up and said “Sugar Report.” I said, “Yes, but
don’t tell my brother Ed. We’re trying to keep it a secret.” So anyhoo Irish said “Sure
and give Mutzie me love and a little regards to her old man.” See baby we all loves ya like mad.
Haven’t got a group picture of the three of us but will see what I can do and some singles. Have
to wrap this up now as its beginning to take on all the aspects of a book, won’t tell you to be
good but as always be careful, take care of yourselves kids and I’ll do the same at this end,
night now
                                                           
Your affectionate brother

Before ’46 Rolls Around



Oh, the many small celebrations of life that keep slipping by, even when big brother is away in
the Navy!

“The Kid,” as Frank Stevens usually calls his younger brother when he isn’t calling him
“Chip,” is actually Gerald Anthony Stevens , the youngest child born to William and Agnes
Tully Stevens . Gerry was only eleven years of age when his next-oldest brother left home for
the Navy Training Center at Great Lakes early in 1942. With a birthday occurring late in the
year, so not quite fifteen at the time of this letter from Frank to their older brother Ed and his
wife, Gerry must have just graduated from grade school—yet another special occasion Frank
is not able to attend.

            Glad the kid graduated ok. I can imagine he was excited, as I know I
sure was, felt sort of like the first dance—at least it did to me. Got any idea of what
high-school folks are going to send him to?

The signant ring you give the kid sounds ok but of course I like diamonds, you know me champagne
appetite and a beer pocket. I’d like to have seen Ma presiding at a fun fest for the club gala at
the new shack, there’s just one

  thing I know for sure about that crowd and that is that they won’t be holding any more baby
showers for the members. Check on that Miss Blue! All kidding aside they are a swell bunch and
I’ve still got a blanket coming. I could really go for one of those old time parties that mom
knows how to throw ninety percent of those and ten percent of one of my type really turn into
something big. Check with Father Davidson on that. The way you describe it the new house must
really be nice hope I see it before ’46 rolls around.

Frank seems to feel much more freedom to be, well, frank in his letters to his brother and his
wife. He brings up one sore spot in the family—something that I’ve yet to figure out, as
only with the receipt of this stack of papers from last August’s trip to Chicago have I even
encountered the names of this next-mentioned couple. Often referred to as if part of the
family, the wife is not someone I can find in any of the usual genealogical research places. And
yet, much later in a letter home to Agnes, this woman refers to her as “Mom.” Since the
elder Stevens family took in students as boarders from time to time, I wonder if this was her
link to the Stevens family—or perhaps the family took in whatever that decade’s
equivalent of foster children might have been.



Though the young woman is well thought of by family, for whatever reason, her husband, Lee, is
more coolly received. Whatever he has been up to during these war years meets with downright
disapproval from the uncharacteristically outspoken Frank. Though Frank doesn’t say so,
the war has evidently taken a lot out of him. Even so, this and more comments (which I’ve
removed) were meant only as sibling-to-sibling confidences; perhaps their mom has reason to
see things vastly different than do the brothers.

              So Lee is finally being caught up with. If he has any doubts as to
what branch of the army he is going into I can clarify them for him. All uncle Sam needs are
Infantrymen and his next address is going to be fort footblister somewhere USA. Yea verily I
say unto you quote You can fool some of the people some of the time but where does it get you? In the
end???????? End of quote. T. S. That boy has been spoofing the draft board too Damn Long, not
that I like to see homes broken up or anything like that but this chile has been getting parts off
of old fords thrown at his POSTERIOR just about long enough to want everybody else I know out
here for company Period. …(This is all on the QT Mutz lets keep peace in the family if
possible) Friday the thirteenth is a hell of a day to start in the service.

There are kinder words for other members of the family. Although Frank was very close to his
brother Ed, he also seems to have quite a warm spot for his older brother Bill as well. Though I
don’t know what financial or health strains the couple are under at this time, Frank
fervently but realistically hopes the best for them.

            Mom told me that Bill and Max are expecting again. Can’t see it
myself but if the doc says its ok well, I guess she’ll be all-right. Do know that she isn’t
strong enough to undergo much of a siege, poor kid she hasn’t had much fun—has she? I feel
sorry for both Bill and Max, if I ever saw two people any more in love than those two I can’t
remember. They really have had some tough breaks. I’m afraid it will be just a little more
than Bill can take if anything happens to her. All we can do is leave it up to the man upstairs, he
usually straightens things out in his own way.

Can’t, Don’t Want To, Can’t Afford To



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ujaRBYIzryk/Tu2BNr9E0tI/AAAAAAAAApA/kdjqTzTmpQA/s1600/Frank+Stevens+home+on+leave+fr+Navy++-+cropped.jpg
When I found the stash of additional letters home from my father-in-law, Frank Stevens , I
guess it rattled me so much that I bolted straight into posting those new finds while I was still
in the middle of another letter. Since I’ve finished the series on the letters from that
third discovery, let’s pick up where we left off : in the middle of a letter from Frank to his
brother Ed and his wife. Dated July 15, 1945 , it picks up in our timeline right where we left off
with Frank’s last letter home on July 9. This one reveals a bit more of Frank’s thinking
about plans for his future, and what is to become of his relationship with Jeanne. I wonder how
much of this is the result of his parents’ advice to remember he is still only twenty years of
age.



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FPybY4qR6iA/Tu2B9TH7kJI/AAAAAAAAApI/obxRty2Em3k/s400/19450715+fr+Frank+Stevens+-+pg+1+-+cropped+3.jpg

            You’re right in thinking that I want to get home but I think
civilian life is going to be a bit tame for this kid when it is all over, besides I’m strictly a
sad sack when it comes to having a trade or being interested in anything but what I’m doing
right now. On top of that I kind of like to travel 



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ob5hXe-UAF0/Tu2C_is5EXI/AAAAAAAAApQ/lF8A1dv0QtM/s400/19450715+fr+Frank+Stevens+-+pg+2+-+cropped+1.jpg

and see the rest of the world and I’d never be able to do that if I were a civilian, I’d just
never have that much money. No kidding Mutz I haven’t saved a damn cent since I’ve been in
this outfit and I don’t think I ever shall, the folks sort of keep me drained, don’t get me
wrong, I’m not bitching or anything but that’s the way it stands. I know that I owe the folks
a lot and I also realize that Pat is going to get married some day and she rates that much out of
life. I’m sort of holding the bench down till Chip gets big enough to support Mom and Dad . Wish
that I could help them out with more than I do but right now its out of the question, just so they
are comfortable and happy is all that I care about at present. Now I find that the little woman is
starting to dream of hearing the pitter patter of tiny feet and they aren’t mice. Mutze just
howinhell does a guy go about giving a gal the brushoff by way of letter. I don’t want to hurt
her feelings because she really is a nice kid, in fact one of the nicest girls I’ve ever gone
out with BUT I can’t get married, I don’t want to get married, I can’t afford to get
married and last but not least I happy the way I am. Love em all is my motto, can I help it if one
loves back. I might have gotten a little ardent but not that ardent. I mean no feeling hurt on
either side and I was always a (I blush) gentleman if a Stevens can be one. If you don’t believe
me ask me older brudder but then again I have always been called wilder than he, at least
that’s the way I heered it. Suppose you give me your version of that?

One other piece of news that Frank included in this letter has me puzzled.

               Yeah it too bad about the skipper and I have the unhappy task of
writing his parents a letter, really don’t know how too start it or for that matter how to
write any of it, guess I’ll blunder through it some way.

I’ve tried to examine names on the Navy Muster Rolls included at Ancestry.com , but can’t
locate any changes that would indicate a death or serious injury on board his ship at such a
ranking level, nor any reason why Frank would be the one tasked with sending a personal note.
Perhaps, in addition to the official notices, there might have been a tradition of making a
more personal contact from among those who served alongside the man—something I’m
entirely unsure about. At any rate, someone thought that Frank’s letter-writing skills
would be adequate for the sad occasion. Posted by

Another Type of D-Day



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dj0u589yY3s/Tu0lc6rURPI/AAAAAAAAAow/v4nkN7_tLmc/s1600/Frank+Stevens+home+on+leave+fr+Navy++-+cropped.jpg
With the battles in the South Pacific behind him, Frank Stevens seems to be fixated on
returning to the paradise of his first post after joining the Navy: the Virgin Islands.

Hearing from one of the old gang still stationed at St. Thomas , Frank discovers that his friend
and his wife are expecting a different type of Christmas gift. Jokingly calling it “D
Day,” they are looking forward to the arrival of their first child.

While these are not relatives of our family lines, I’m still curious to find out who these
people are—really good friends? Acquaintances? Just great letter writers in the face of
the day-to-day monotony embedded within the tumult of war?

It will have to be another ten years before I can access any census records on this Tom and Ida Fox
and their baby born in December, 1945. There are too many entries in the Navy muster rolls for
the name, “Thomas Fox.” I don’t even know if Tom was a friend from the old neighborhood in
Chicago, or a coworker met during Frank’s tour of duty.

At any rate, the letter pretty clearly shows Frank’s intentions to return to service in the
Virgin Islands when he is done with his first four years in the Navy.

            Also heard from Tom Fox (St. Thomas) and he said they (he and Ida )
expect their “D” (delivery) day in December. Sounds real happy and is having a swell time
down on the rock, wish I were back down there with him. Believe I’ll request duty down there
when I get back to the states next time. Will close now folks be good and take care of yourselves.

Sweltering at the Recreation Base

Sending gifts home to his mom in Chicago from the exotic outposts of his tour of duty in the south
Pacific, Frank Stevens seems to have finally caught a moment to recuperate with his shipmates
from the strains of two of the key battles wrapping up World War II on his side of the world. 

How could they help but rest? In this tropical heat, everything—and everyone—seems to be
melting!

July 9 th , 1945 Dear Mom, Dad an All:             This is just going to be a short
note as its too hot (109°) to write or do much of anything.             Had a
couple of snap shots taken the other day and they came out pretty good, I’m enclosing the neg
and wonder if you will take them and have a dozen of each made and enlarged to about 6 x 3 in size.
            As you can see two invasions haven’t changed yours truly, I’m
still in one piece.             We are at a rear area recreation base now and are
getting a little liberty, managed to pick up a few votive knick-knacks for you. I imagine you
have received the necklace by now Mom , I sent it air mail and it should get there in about a week or
ten days. Posted by

Home for the Holidays?



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SIyyTjCWFWc/Tul0dnbmcbI/AAAAAAAAAoI/kqoC7s-p2gQ/s1600/Frank+Stevens+home+on+leave+fr+Navy++-+cropped.jpg
Almost exactly half a year before Christmas, 1945, Frank Stevens mentions in his letter to his
folks that he sure would like to be home for the holidays. It’s been a rough three-and-a-half
years in the Navy, especially in these last five months out in the South Pacific, and he’s
ready to be relieved.

But that doesn’t seem to be what’s driving him to want to head home. More than anything, he
is concerned about his father ’s health. Perhaps somewhere deep within that unspoken
internal region of hunches and premonitions, Frank is feeling that he might not make it back to
Chicago in time.

            Say Dad have you been taking care of yourself lately? If not, why not?
Haven’t any idea when I’ll be relieved but hope I get home for the holidays, really would be
too good to be true if it happened that way.

            Will be able to give you a pretty good story in the near future, got
scads to tell but the censor says no at the present.             I know this is a
poor excuse for a letter so I’m enclosing something that might make with a laugh.
            Really must close now, lots of love to all—will write more later,
                                                                       
Love,
                                                                             
Frank

The Censored Way of Life



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-adIWUMkYrlw/Tuls58twrDI/AAAAAAAAAoA/Mneu490z5gw/s1600/Frank+Stevens+home+on+leave+fr+Navy++-+cropped.jpg
After the third week of June, 1945, the battle of Okinawa draws to a close as key islands are
declared secured and converted to Allied air bases. The USS LCI(R)-707 and many other
amphibious craft remain in the vicinity as part of that occupation. Frank Stevens , now
Pharmacist's Mate First Class, snatches a few moments to jot a note to his folks in Chicago,
mainly to keep his dad from worrying about how he is doing.

The ever-present censor is hovering in the back of Frank’s mind as his writing style seems to
revert to those “incoming” mail reports of his earlier days fresh from the Naval Training
Center .

June 28 th , 1945 Dear Folks:             Just have time for a few lines as I have to
get this censored and in the mail in about 20 minutes. Things are still the same, working hard
and not much sleep. Expect things to change and think we are going to get a good rest in the near
future. We rate it if I do say so myself, they really have pushed us for the last five months. Had a
mail call today, one from Jeanne but none from you folks. Heard from John about a week ago and he
sounds lots happier, guess he is getting settled and things are looking brighter. Glad Ed +
Mutz have found a place of their own, sounds as if Dee dee has a pretty fair job. Posted by

About Me

        Jacqi Stevens

    

        It is my contention that, after a lifetime, one of the greatest needs people have is to
        be remembered. They want to know: have I made a difference? I write because I can't
        keep for myself the gifts others have entrusted to me. Through what I've already been
        given--though not forgetting those to whom I must pass this along--from family I
        receive my heritage; through family I leave a legacy. With family I weave a tapestry.
        These are my strands.
