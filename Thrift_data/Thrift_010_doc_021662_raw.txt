Image: images/icons/icon1.gif Leftist Country



I was flipping through channels on my TV the other day, and came across the country music
channel. While I pretty much hate country, I was wondering if there are country musicians that
can be considered leftist? Is this even possible with this genre? __________________

I would say that yes, it technically could. Country music is essentially rural in nature, and I
would argue also widely American. Though it is unlikely that country music would spread to a
country which would accept Leftist ideologies, it is theoretically possible for Leftists to
compose music of this style. Rather than "Them durn Democrats ain't never gonna get ma guns" it
would be more along the lines of "That there bourgeoisie ain't never gonna monopolize the
weapons of revolution". While I would find it wholly tasteless, any lyrics could potentially
be organized into the country rhythm and style and be accompanied by the same twangy, lilting
music, and this includes Leftist lyrics. __________________

Try listening to Pete Seeger or (60's) Bob Dylan, the Weather Underground actually took their
name from a Bob Dylan song.



If you want something a little more recent try listening to Conor Oberst, he penned a few
protest songs back in the mid 2000's. The Following User Says Thank You to Who? For This Useful

i think its fair to call bob dylan leftist and country. several country artists were seriously
concerned with working conditions in the south and were politically active "bluenecks" as
far as raising minimum wage, ect, but were not radicals in any way. hobo8675309 View Public

realized it was nonsense, and that the only thing that was important was to live his own life
happily and freely, not to "mess around with other people's lives" by working for civil and
human rights, ending war and poverty, etc. He was asked what he thought about the Berkeley

about Sacco & Vanzetti. He wrote a column for the Communist Party newspaper called "Woody Sez"
and lived in a commune for a while. You may recognize him as the guy who wrote "This Land is Your

homeless people snipped when it's performed today.

It is sad that on a leftist forum there are those who haven't heard of Woody Guthrie.



I would venture that some of the mixed feelings about music and its sociopolitical impact
occur because of the disconnect between the emotional immediacy of music and the perceived
legitimacy of words set to it. I have heard rightists applaud the DDR's Nationalhymne, not
realizing what they were hearing, because it stirred them. These same types will be deeply
suspicious of a Steve Earle because he's a "goddam communist" ( whether true or no I couldn't
say; his work has a deep anti-corporate streak), even as they boogie down. Music, as opposed to
lyrics by themselves, is something you either like or you don't. There's no need to build and
buttress fact and argument. I like, without apology, some traditional gospel songs because
they are good music. I don't have to react to words. Modern "Christian music", though, goes
real bad real quick on the double count of being lyricwise cryptofascist corporate pablum
and, musicwise, sterile soulless shit.

I think about as country you can get on the left, or as left you can get in country. Although I'd
classify him more as Americana.

Good point about Earle as Americana. All of these pigeonholing musical categories are pretty
much meaningless. I have wondered how such an artist as Ramon Ayala is perceived,
sociopolitically and beyond a purely musical standard, in Mexico- would he do
narcocorridos. Last spring Los Tigres ran bad afoul of the political structure by releasing a
video animation which apparently cut way too close to the truth about government/cartel
collusion. I'd love to catch any of the Norteno groups next time I'm down south. redsky View

in Mexico- would he do narcocorridos. Last spring Los Tigres ran bad afoul of the political
structure by releasing a video animation which apparently cut way too close to the truth about
government/cartel collusion. I'd love to catch any of the Norteño groups next time I'm down
south. I don't really know who those people you're talking about are. I'll check them out,
since I'm always looking for new inspiration and music inspires me tremendously.



I'm also not sure what a corrido is, some type of Mexican folk song/poem, correct? Have you
heard of Americo Paredes?

Is there a market for leftist country musicians? (I'll have to capitalise on my lovely guitar
playing skills if there is!) The original protest songs in the Western world were Folk music.

I know I've heard protest songs from out of Appalachia against the coal industry. I wonder if
anyone has names of bands which sang these? Elfcat View Public Profile Send a private message
