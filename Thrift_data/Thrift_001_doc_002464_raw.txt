September 4th, 2012

Any reader of my blog, or anyone they knows me personally will know there is one luxury that I
don’t mind spending money on… Candles.

If I could, I would have scented candles burning around me 24/7. I love them. They make me feel
different and special things, they transport me and they smell absolutely divine!

But they only smell divine if you find the right ones… And as I’m always searching high and
low for great candles, I have once again hit the big time on these ones. Palm Beach Collection.

Palm Beach CollectionÂ is an exquisite new eco-friendly Australian lifestyle
productÂ range for true lovers of contemporary style, with a feeling of indulgence.

The all-naturalÂ Palm Beach CollectionÂ range is luxurious yet affordable and
consists ofÂ beautiful hand-poured scented candles and reed diffusers in an extensive
array ofÂ delicious scents including Vintage Gardenia (my fave), Coconut & Lime, Pear &
Cinnamon, Honey &Â Peach Blossom and Mint Leaf & Avocado.

I did my research and discovered what Palm Beach Collection was all about and who was behind
it.Â Â Brother and sister duo,Â Kirsten WalkerandÂ Mike Grey developed this
incredibleÂ collection of eco-friendly soy wax and essential oil candles with the
landscapes of Sydney in mind.

Kirsten and Mikeâ€™s childhood was spent in the beachside surrounds of
Avalon,Â Clareville and Palm Beach in Sydney, where their parents still reside. Palm
BeachÂ Collection is very proudly a family owned and run Australian business. The team
areÂ passionate about ensuring their product remains Australian made close to the shores
ofÂ their beloved home in Sydney.

The clever pair have travelled the globe extensively over a number of years to research
andÂ develop what they believe to be the finest fragrance creations from
leadingÂ international experts in the art of perfume. From humble beginnings as a
start-upÂ business less than three years ago, Palm Beach Collection is now recognised
amongstÂ the best Australian made and owned candle collections, with more than 400
stockistsÂ Australia wide.

I had the pleasure of interviewing Mike Grey about Palm Beach Collection.

1. There are many candle collections out there, what makes your product different?

This is a very good question. I believe the story behind Palm Beach Collection and how we came
about as a brand has a lot to do with creating our originality. Palm Beach Collection is not just
a substandard product with a label slapped on its jar or bottle, we have created this
collection with love- the love of family. The entire Palm Beach Collection team are family and
we have created this together-family made and owned, it is truly a heart-warming story and I
feel like this translates in our brand and product. We are an eco-friendly collection and use
renewable supplies such as soy which is a big point of difference.

2. There is a luxurious beach Hamptons style feeling around the collection, have you
purposely gone for this style? Is it one you live in your own life?

We love everything about the area we live in and we wanted to create a Palm Beach experience in
every product we have. Our packaging and fragrances reflect our lifestyle and surroundings,
being both beach and sophistication. I think this has caught the eye of Hampton enthusiasts
but personally you canâ€™t beat Palm Beach Sydney!

3. Scents trigger memories, especially candles for me. Do any of your candles bring back
special memories?

Absolutely! I love how quickly I can be transported back to a time in the past just by scent.
White Rose & Jasmine reminds me of our family garden where I grew up. The Jasmine is such a strong
trigger that I literally visualise a certain day, just amazing. Mint Leaf & Avocado brings
back Christmas for me as a small boy. I can remember the holidays and the excitement of the beach
bringing back so many memories. Our scents have been created with this in mind, everyone has a
history making each favourite so personal.

4. What is your inspiration behind each of the candle and diffuser concoctions?

We have been inspired by our surroundings here on the Australian Northern Beaches. Many
native flower oils and beautiful citrus extracts accompanied by wooden base notes have
helped create this. Mood plays a big part in the creation of a fragrance, like mentioned above
scent does entice feelings through the senses. This is why I love this range, I can use a
fragrance to create mood or to alter it. We have also travelled extensively and taken ideas
from European inspiration, some of the fragrances being developed in Europe are just superb.
We like to look for points of difference to inspire us as well.

Itâ€™s hard to ask a mother or father which one of their kids is their favourite â€“
but letâ€™s be honest, they all do! Which is your favourite candle and diffuser?

Ha ha I love it, and may I say quite the fitting question as we are brother and sister! We all have
our favourites and mine is White Rose & Jasmine in both the candle and the diffuser, I generally
am not a floral lover but this fragrance I just canâ€™t get enough of!

6. What is the most common piece of feedback you get about your collection?

Love the name, love the scents and love the packaging. Also what ideas have you got for the next
candle fragrance?

7. Do you know of any celebrities/high profile people that use your products? If so who and is
there a story behind that?

Nicole and Lionel Richie loved the candles while they were in Australia and took some back to
the US with them, Australian Olympian Leisel Jones is a huge fan and Lara Bingle and her mum also
love the brand!

8. What is next for Palm Beach Collection?

We are still growing as a business and we have started to export to Europe and the UK. Along with
the launch of our E boutique just last month we have a some exciting things in the pipeline.

It is important to remain dynamic in this market so without giving to much away you can expect to
see some amazing newness happen to the range in the next few months.

Expanding out into new countries and representing quality Australian made products in
various markets is next. We want to be the best ambassadors for Australian made home fragrance
products both at home and off shore.

The Palm Beach Collection prices range from $37.95 for theÂ Candle
CollectionÂ andÂ Diffuser CollectionÂ through $109.95 for theDeluxe
CandleÂ range. With a growingÂ selection of more than 20 divine fragrances such as
Coconut & Lime, Tahitian Mango,Â French Vanilla and Sweet Basil & Citrus, Palm Beach
Collection continues its rapidÂ expansion with the launch of their first e-commerce
store as well as more product linesÂ currently under development and due for release soon.

Do yourself a favour and purchase one of these candles. I love them and am stocking up on them for
summer!

TIP: Grab some of the smaller ones to take with you on holidays, I’ll be taking a few to Byron
Bay this year. What this does is sets a scent and a memory – you’ll be able to take yourself
back on holidays while you’re burning your candle at home or the office.
