America is in the midst of a raging cultural and spiritual war. Forces of Good, Light,
Conservatism and a Judeo-Christian Worldview daily battle the forces of Evil, Darkness,
Socialism, False Religions and Philosophies. A Good Choice is on the frontlines exposing
evil across America’s political and social spectrum.

Obama's failed leadership on Medicare reform

O n Saturday I read the following tweet by Tim Pawlenty as quoted in the Mansfield (Ohio)
News Journal article titled, " After Obama's European tour, challenges at home ."



"(S)orry to interrupt your European pub crawl, but what was your Medicare plan?" --- Tim
Pawlenty tweet

Our Teleprompted President is a better Campaigner-in-Chief than he is Commander-in-Chief.
He demonstrates that he lacks basic leadership experience and skills. He must be defeated in
November 2012.

current occupier of the White House:



"I miss Saturday morning, rolling out of bed, not shaving, getting into my car with my girls,
driving tohe supermarket, squeezing the fruit, getting my car washed, taking walks."

--- Barack Obama to the editors and publishers of the Hearst magazines, lamenting his lack of

Hip Hop Rap on Abortion

H at tip goes to @yosephdaviyd on Twitter who posted a link to this excellent video. Powerful
lyrics follow. Memorial Day is an opportunity to remember our fallen Veterans in the various
wars in which America has participated. It is also an opportune time to remember the 53 million
plus babies of Veterans and others who have been murdered in their mothers' wombs. This is
nothing less than an American Holocaust, an American Atrocity. May God forgive us our great
sin.

.





Chapter 4: Abortion





This thing is drastic - my sadness I can’t mask it.



It’s tragic how wombs have turned into caskets .

Genocide on the unborn – Have you seen this?

Babies sacrificed on the altar of convenience .







At least two lives are shredding - Impossible, not to regret it,

As hard as she tries, she won’t forget it.

A personal war that hurts to the core ,

But yet there’s hope with a merciful Lord! Posted by gregjaye at 4:50 AM No comments:

The Whole Armor of God, Part 13b

Today I return to my series of articles commenting on the concept and principles involved in
the Armor of God, which the Apostle Paul described in the New Testament. This is the topic of the
Sunday school lesson, which I am currently teaching.

.

That you may be able to withstand in the evil day: Ephesians 6:13.

.

Evil comes against each one of us in one form or another. This scripture (Ephesians 6:13) is
telling us that we are to be able to withstand it (evil).



Solomon writes that evil comes upon us unawares. Ecclesiastics 9:11,12 illustrates this
fact, “I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to
the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet
favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. For man also knoweth not his
time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so
are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them."



Solomon writes that time and chance takes place, and overtakes all people. We live thinking
that life will continue on only to discover we are old. This happens through no fault of one’s
own. It just happens. Chance happens to each of us. A person is at the wrong place at the wrong
time or is at the right place at the right time.



To deal with the unexpected, or even to prevent it, requires faith in God and God’s help. Only
He knows the future.



My brother, at 17 years of age in September of 1969, was driving south on State Route 19 out of
Fremont, Ohio. He crossed a railroad track and started around a wide bend trying to drive it
at 75 miles per hour. The front right tire went off the pavement onto the gravel berm. He
quickly whipped the steering wheel to the left at which point the car rolled, the door flew
open, and he was thrown out of the car. It rolled over him: killing him instantly. He was caught
at an evil time which came upon him suddenly. Before we say he didn’t withstand in the evil day
we need to realize that he was born-again. That means that he went to heaven when he died.



Granted, this was a situation of his individual choosing. When you are being thrown out of the
car and the car is rolling over you; your options are few. At that time, your previous
relationship with the Almighty becomes mighty important. Jesus said, “I am the way, the
truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father but by me (John 14:6).” Once a person is
born-again they are going to heaven when they die. They do not have to fear the future. You can
repent of your sins by confessing to God that you are a sinner and inviting Jesus into your heart
and be born again.



December 22, 1964 I had my own encounter of being caught at an evil time. Driving down a mountain
road in Iran toward Kerman, Iran I rolled the ¾ ton truck I was driving. I was pulling a trailer
behind me which had no brakes. In negotiating a wide left hand turn in the road the trailer tried
to pass me on the right. I turned the steering wheel to get the truck aligned with the trailer but
to no avail and the truck ran into the side of the mountain and rolled over. When the accident was
investigated the investigators were amazed that the cab was not torn off the truck. They
noticed that I had lashed a completely full propane bottle, five feet in height, to a bow behind
the cab and the truck pivoted on the propane bottle. The truck was still drivable although the
cab heater was smashed. The company commander was tired of the troops having accidents so he
put out the word that the next soldier to have a vehicle accident was going to be hung. Not
actually of course, but the soldier may wish he were dead after the company commander finished
with him. Yours truly was the next soldier to have a vehicle accident. Another small problem
was that I had not passed my driver’s test to get a driver's license. I was given a license
anyway. The motor pool sergeant ssid he would teach me to drive. He had not, so he was also
facing big trouble.



To repair the vehicle; parts were taken off of other vehicles which were salvage vehicles. The
cost of the parts thus used was counted as zero. One vehicle was over a thousand miles away and a
mechanic had to take a boat to the vehicle to retrieve it. On the trip He was even caught in foul
weather on the Strait of Hormuz and in a fire fight between warring tribes on the other side of
the Strait from Iran in Oman. The financial threshold for reporting an accident was fifty
dollars. The stated cost of repairing the vehicle came to forty-seven dollars and fifty
cents. The accident was never reported. God had taken care of me both in the accident and in the
aftermath.



Remember, the evil day comes at a time when we are not expecting it. It is God’s power that
protects us and sees us through enabling us to withstand in the evil day.



The Psalmist makes this statement in Psalms 46:1b-7:



“God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear,
though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling
thereof. Selah.



“There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the
tabernacles of the most High. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help
her, and that right early.



“The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. The
LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.”



It is important to withstand in the evil day when our faith is attacked. We are to be faithful
unto death.



What Jesus said to the church of Smyrna is appropriate for each one of us today. Revelation 2:10
states, “Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast
some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou
faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”



The statement in Revelation 12:11 is worth remembering today. “And they overcame him
(Satan) by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their
lives unto the death.”



A vivid demonstration of the above verse is that of the first martyr, Stephen. His history is
found in Acts 6:8-7:60. Stephen was disputing with some people of the synagogue of the
Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, Cilicia and Asia. These brought Stephen before the
council and brought false charges against him. When he was allowed to speak he preached to them
telling them that Jesus is the Prophet Moses spoke about who would come after Moses. The
council was enraged at Stephen. They dragged him out of Jerusalem and stoned him to death.
Stephen held on to his faith and was faithful unto death. He withstood in the evil day.



In 1974 the North Korean government claimed to have eradicated the last of the Christians in
the country. It seems they were building a road for their leader to travel in the country when
they found 29 Christians who had been living underground for two decades. Four of the group
were quickly hung by the neck. The others were allowed to live so they could be crushed while
alive with a steam-roller beginning with the feet and moving up the torso with each successive
pass.



Does this seem cruel to you? Barack Husain Obama has just signed hate crimes legislation
protecting homosexuality. His avowed goal is to make each American accept homosexuality as a
normal life style. The Christians have not been united politically in this country to support
godliness in government policies thus allowing the godless to legalize immorality and
punish godliness. Unless the situation is changed quickly overt state persecution of
Christians is possible.



Prepare now to withstand in the evil day. Posted by Sam at 9:05 AM No comments:

What is absolute anathema to the Left



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sj_g7HUMTOI/TeFwOXZ5MhI/AAAAAAAAF0A/fWaKtDdwQiU/s200/lloyd_marcus.jpg
Lloyd Marcus What troubles, upsets, irritates, infuriates, and concerns the radical Left
elites, who currently are in power in government, media, entertainment, etc. in America, are
conservative blacks and conservative women. Blacks especially, who wander off or escape the
Leftist owned or managed plantations, raise the intense ire of their “entitled” or
“rightful” masters.





The liberal politicians and other so-called elites claim to “protect” and
“provide” for the downtrodden minority. All they want in return is their vote. They
pander to their base, minorities and unions, just like the RINOs pander do to the pro-life and
Tea Party conservatives only for their vote at election time and do the opposite or nothing
when they arrive in Washington. A perfect example is the pittance of real spending cuts that
were extracted by Speaker Boehner in the Fiscal Year 2010 budget so-called showdown with
Nancy Pelosi ’s and Harry Reid ’s Democrat comrades.





The current issue of the Tea Party Review (June 2011) magazine has a number of excellent
articles about conservative women and men, black and white who have the audacity to walk away
from the Democratic Party and its lies and destructive core philosophy.





In one article, “ The heart and soul of a black Tea Partier ,” on page 21 Sakina Mengle asks
the following insightful question, “… (I)s the American Dream under Obama ’s
administration slowly devolving into an unrecognizable nightmare wrapped in
ultraliberal/Progressive ideology?” It most certainly is. It is rapidly devolving,
Sakina . The dreams of our President’s father, which he has taken as his own, are a socialist,
Marxist nightmare and no utopia.

Sakina Mengle Mengle goes on to observe in regard to the election of our half-baked,
half-black President, “I am left to surmise that it was racism, swathed in black pride,
dipped in white guilt, and gobbled up by the establishment media that put an obscure
inexperienced state senator (and one-term federal Senator) into the White House.” Well
said, my sentiments exactly!

Herman Cain Should Get an F.





Saturday, Greg gave Herman Cain an "A" grade after the first debate .  After reading this
article, I think you will change your mind.  Cain says that he is not a politician because he
has never held a public office.  Yet he was the chairman of the Kansas City branch of the
Federal Reserve.  Basically this means that he is technically holding a position within a
private institution, but with tremendous political powers that should not even be given to
elected officials, much less a corporate employee.  Hat tip to Fortunateson of the Daily
Paul for this one.



http://youtu.be/Ol45PnAIFRU

I politely questioned Herman Cain about his praise of the TARP Bailouts back in 2008 and his
chiding of free market purists... I then went on to ask him his opinion of billions of taxpayer
dollars being spent to bailout Foreign Banks in China/Libya/etc... When I mentioned that..
he high tailed it out of there... told me that it was too long of a question to ask.. and one of his
supporters slapped my wrist/forearm (I was shaking hands with Mr. Cain while I was
questioning him)
http://www.tennesseesonsofliberty.com/2011/05/herman-cain-exposed.html



Herman Cain has also said that there is no need to audit the Federal Reserve even though the Fed
bailed out many countries secretly INCLUDING LIBYA.  You now know whose side he is really on.
 I can't see anyone in the field of candidates that I could vote for except Ron Paul or possibly
Michele Bachmann if she runs.  Either way I will have to hold my nose while voting.



And remember that Cain said that he supported Mitt Romney in the 2008 primary.  Unless Cain
does really, really well, he will almost certainly give his delegates to Romney.  Ron Paul,
on the other hand, *might* give his delegates to Michele Bachmann (Gary Johnson will almost
surely have dropped out by then).  Bachmann was on a short list of about 30 candidates for
Congress which Ron Paul endorsed in 2008.  I am not sure though who Michele Bachmann would
give her delegates to if she drops out before the end, but it doesn't really matter if there is no
one else left worth voting for. Posted by Matt at 8:26 PM No comments:

Why Evil Exists in the World Today, Part 2



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LHJvr7vGKUs/TdkXLz544vI/AAAAAAAAAoU/1lkZF-pXiyM/s400/tree%2Bof%2Bgood%2Band%2Bevil.jpg



We see evil all around us today. TV, newspapers, and radio all chronicle the ravages of evil. I
am continuing in a new series today, taking a brief break from my current series, “Armor of
God.”



If you wanted someone to love you; wouldn’t you want them to love you of their own free will,
rather than because they had no other choice?



God Provided the Human Race with A Choice: To Obey God or To Disobey God





God accomplished giving mankind a choice at the time of creation. He created the Garden of Eden
and put in it the Tree of Life and also the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.



Genesis 2:15-17, “And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it
and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou
mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for
in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”



Satan used the serpent to deceive Eve. She chose to disobey God by eating of the fruit of the Tree
of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Adam, who was not deceived, also disobeyed God by eating of
the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.



Genesis 3:6, “And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant
to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat,
and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.”



I Timothy 2:14, “Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the
transgression.”



This was how sin originated in mankind. The source of temptation was Satan, who is the
personification of evil. Eve, then Adam, succumbed to the temptation and sinned. Human
nature has been fallen ever since. Posted by Sam at 9:56 AM 1 comment:

Assessment of Announced Candidates for President as of 5/21/2011, Updated 11 PM

Updated 11:00 pm 5/21/2011 after I found out that Herman Cain formally announced that he is
running for President.



Hat tip goes to OneNewsNow.com for the pictures of the candidates. You can read a more in-depth
account of what the candidates are saying here .  



All of the announced candidates in the race for Presidents are listed below.  They are
listing in my preferred order of ability and preparation for service in that most important
office. There is a reason why I list the incumbent last. if the election were held
today amoung the announce candidates I could only vote for two of the following
candidates, that would be Herman Cain and Dr. Paul .





Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZD-k6Y-U2o8/Tdh65jIKa4I/AAAAAAAAFz0/7p0jCn1Xk-M/s1600/herman-cain_jpg.jpg
  Earlier today C-Span reported that Herman Cain announced that he was running for
President. When I initially wrote this article I was unaware that Mr. Cain was running. I
listened to his 30 minute announcement speech , which he made in Atlanta. He immediately rises
to the top of my list. Here is  why I think he is the best candidate in the current field,,
listen to his words from today's speech, "Is America ready for a real leader, or (does she want
to stay with) a (Teleprompter) reader?" That is powerful stuff. This guy is a social as well as a
fiscal conservative. I would rate him an A  as Presidential material.





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dpBYWSXP3QE/TdgyCTX2jLI/AAAAAAAAFzs/HpZmSef3bPE/s1600/RonPaul_status3.jpg
  Congressman Ron Paul is strong on fiscal conservative issues, he wants to get control of the
Federal Reserve, he questions our entanglements overseas. I would rate him a C+ candidate as
Presidential material.



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yRGxoF8ujLQ/TdgxUaGdxNI/AAAAAAAAFzo/iD4pqBhsQZk/s1600/NewtGingrich_status3.jpg
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has some good ideas, but he also has some very bad
ideas. He turned me off forever when he joined with Nancy Pelosi in support of Global
Warming. This is inexcusable for a Conservative. He is too inconsistent for me. I would
rate him a  D- candidate as Presidential material.





Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zhKI19H9Lss/TdgxMbVqTsI/AAAAAAAAFzk/_NnIfDGxM9E/s1600/GaryJohnson_status3.jpg
I don't know too much about this former Governor. His performance in the first GOP debate
in South Carolina a few weeks ago showed that he was much to libertarian for me. He seemed to be
very weak on the key social issues. I would rate him an  F candidate as Presidential material.





Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QTbrILaU_iU/TdgxEGiCqnI/AAAAAAAAFzg/YshEHEQoX9Q/s1600/BarackObama_status3.jpg
I know too much about this candidate. Prior to his election in 2008  Barack Obama  was the
least qualified, most inexperienced, and least prepared. He has proven over the past 2 1/2
years to be even more inept and inappropriate for this nation's highest office  than when he
was elected. He remains the least qualified and inexperienced. He is literally a vehicle
being used by George Soros and the Left to destroy this nation. He must be defeated. I look at him
as having served Jimmy Carter 's second term, therefore, he is term-limited! He is
un-rate-able as a candidate to continue as President. Posted by gregjaye at 11:19 PM No

Obama’s Middle East Policy: Throw Israel under the bus!



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-saCfv84aEww/TdfDOOkh1LI/AAAAAAAAFzY/_qNqXjv-nQ8/s200/obamaevileye_Netanyahu-vi.jpg
Obama in his second major speech on the Middle East not only throws Israel under the bus, but he
backs up the bus and runs over the nation of Israel, then abandons it for dead! Below are a couple
of troublesome quotes from President Barack Husein Obama ’s Teleprompted speech, which he
delivered this week. This was a very insulting speech given less than 24 hours prior to a
meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .



“The US believes that negotiations should result in two states, with permanent
Palestinian borders with Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, and permanent Israeli borders with
Palestine .”



“As for security, every state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able to
defend itself - by itself - against any threat.”

In the first he wants the borders of Israel to be returned to pre-1967, prewar demarcation.
This is a joke. Israel was attacked. A war occurred. Israel won the war, they ceased the spoils
of war, now Obama wants to see Israel give up their land. Whose side is this guy on? It sure seems
that in everything he does he favors the Muslim cause. And he says he is a Christian?



As for the second quote the President is saying that Israel is on its own. He appears to be
abandoning Americans strongest and perhaps only ally in the Middle East. Is this how we treat
our friends? I agree with those who state that this man is anti-Sematic.



Once again this controversial and increasingly unpopular President has demonstrated his
own and his entire administration’s vast inexperience and his and their Muslim and Marxist
bias.

Raising the roof over the debt ceiling



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EkewJ4FgHuI/TdMVi0CiAFI/AAAAAAAAFzA/lxPmlA5O-jE/s320/Debt+Ceiling.jpg

The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch runs a regular feature in its newspaper identifying an
important issue to the local community and asking for the vote of the readers on that
particular issue along with any related comment. Occasionally I will respond and make a
comment on the issue raised, as I did on today’s topic.

The Hot Issue:



Do you think Congress should raise the federal debt ceiling without huge budget cuts?

______ Yes

__ X __ No



My Response:



No, in fact, Congress should LOWER the debt ceiling and immediately cut spending. The crisis
is not an insufficient debt ceiling. The crisis is that government has been SPENDING beyond
its means. Enough is enough. We need to get a handle on our expenditures. If it mean drastic cuts
across the board, so be it.



I believe that most Americans want Washington's spending spree to stop. This is a winning
political issue. More importantly, it's the right thing to do. It's the moral thing to do. This
is why the GOP won the majority seats in the House of Representatives. The big question is will
the Republicans stand on principle or will they bow to Wasting-a-ton, D.C. mentality, the way
we've always done it, and raise the ceiling?  Posted by gregjaye at 8:49 PM No comments:

Why Evil Exists in the World Today, Part 1



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5G8k7e4F_t4/Tc6pZ4G88fI/AAAAAAAAAoE/VR9sL8jhzSM/s400/monkeys-hear-no-evil-see-no-evil-speak-no-evil.jpg

We see evil all around us today. TV, newspapers, and radio all chronicle the ravages of evil. I
am starting a new series today, taking a brief break from my current series, “Armor of
God.”





If you wanted someone to love you; wouldn’t you want them to love you of their own free will,
rather than because they had no other choice?





Creation of the Human Race  



God created man in His own image, after His own likeness, and gave him dominion over the earth
(authority over other created things on earth).

In Genesis 1:26, 27 we read, “And God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth.’ So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female
created He them.” Therefore, man is the highest form of God's creation. In other words, you
and I are God's ultimate masterpiece.



Part of being like God (made in His image) is having the ability to choose of one’s own
freewill, having self determination. In order for people to have the ability to choose to obey
and love God, they also had to have the ability to choose to not obey and not to love God. This is
the source of freedom and liberty. America's founders understood and acted on this
principle, which is based on the morality found in the Holy Bible. That is the reason why
we have been a free and a great nation.   Posted by Sam at 10:54 AM No comments:

Our (Still) Unsecured Borders

D espite wide evidence to the contrary, such as murders of border patrol agents and Americans
living along our southern border, continuous drug and human trafficking, our increasingly
controversial and unpopular President contends our borders are now secured. He mocks those
of us who recognize the truth about our borders as unwilling to recognize his repeated
assertion that he has made the borders more secure than they ever have been. He cunningly tries
to paint conservatives as wholly anti-immigrants, when we really oppose outright ILLEGAL
immigration and strongly support LEGAL immigration.  



  The President repeats over and over the mantra that our borders are secured. He lies. They
are not. The borders remain porous. Immigration laws remain essentially unenforced.
Sanctuary cities continue to disregard the rule of law. Now his recent campaign speech to his
hopeful 'Hispanic base' in Texas was just that, campaign rhetoric, campaign promises. 

Hat tip goes to the HotAirPundit , which posted this YouTube video featuring Arizona Governor
Jan Brewer on its website recently.

Less talk, more action from GOP "Leaders"!!!



I received an email from Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives John Boehner . I
immediately shot back the following reply:

S peaker Boehner -



Do you mean what you say? The American people would like to see Republicans stand on the
principles that they espouse. Seems once you are safely entrenched in Washington for another
two years, you forget those promises you made.



I am disappointed with the Republican Party as a whole and how little you got in the Fiscal Year
2011 budget battle. In my eyes you lost big time.



We must stop spending. A good place to start is DECREASING the debt ceiling back a couple of
billion instead of raising it even one blue cent.



Please DO something ... I for one am quite tired of all the rhetoric and empty promises!



Sincerely,



- GregJaye







JOHN BOEHNER'S E-BULLETIN: WEDNESDAY, MAY 11

  No Debt Limit Increase Without Significant Cuts And Reforms



This week, I addressed the Economic Club of New York on our efforts to create a better
environment for private sector job growth by cutting government spending, preventing
job-crushing tax hikes, and eliminating excessive federal regulations.  One of the major
issues that I addressed in my remarks is something that I know that many of you have questions
and concerns about: President Obama’s request that we raise the national debt limit.  

  While it is true that allowing America to default by refusing to allow any increase in the
debt limit once it expires would be irresponsible, it would be more irresponsible to raise
the debt ceiling without simultaneously taking dramatic steps to reduce spending and reform
the budget process. 

In my speech, I made clear that without significant spending cuts and reforms to reduce our
debt, there will be no debt limit increase.  These cuts should be greater than the
accompanying increase in debt authority the president is given, and they should be actual
cuts and program reforms.  Broad deficit or debt targets that punt the tough questions to the
future are not acceptable.

   We need to send a signal to investors and entrepreneurs everywhere that America is
serious about dealing with our spending addiction.  We must increase confidence in our
economy and reduce uncertainty for small businesses.  We need to encourage the creation
American jobs. Posted by gregjaye at 6:14 PM No comments:

The Whole Armor of God, Part 13A



Today I continue my series of articles commenting on the concept and principles involved in
the Armor of God , which the Apostle Paul described in the New Testament. This is the topic of the
Sunday school lesson, which I am currently teaching.

Stand against the wiles of the devil, Ephesians 6:11.

To “stand” means to remain in an upright position. To remain unchanged in one’s
opinion, attitude, point of view, to resist hostilities, and to hold one’s ground.  Not
giving in to contraction.

In this passage, Ephesians 6:11, a person is standing against the wiles of Satan. These can
come into a person’s mind as thoughts or suggestions from others. You may wonder, “Where
did that thought come from,” or may even think it is your own thought. Satan can insert
thoughts into our mind. On the other hand, you may hear what someone else says. They both can be a
wile of the devil.

In one such case God has recorded for us in the Holy Bible found in Acts 4:32-37; 5:1-11. People
were selling property and bringing the whole amount of the sale to the Apostles and giving it to
the church. Ananias and Sapphira evidently wanted the prestige of giving 100% of the sale of
their property, but they also wanted the money. They came upon a plan to sell their property,
give 50% to the Apostles and the church, and say it was the total price of the land. This way they
thought they would get both prestige and money. It never occurred to them that this was a wile of
the devil. The first key they failed to notice was that they had to lie to carry out their plan. Of
course they may have thought, “Who will know the difference.” Evidently, they figured
God would never notice or even care.

When Ananias brought the money, Peter asked him why Satin had filled his heart to lie to the Holy
Spirit. Peter told him that he had not lied to man but to God. Upon hearing this Ananias fell down
dead at the feet of Peter. God had recognized the wile of the devil and stood against it.
Sapphira came to Peter three hours later and Peter asked her if the property was sold for such
and such a price. She said that it was the price. Peter asked, “Why did you agree with your
husband to test the Spirit of the Lord?” Then Peter said, “The feet of those who buried your
husband are at the door and they will bury you also.  Then she fell down dead also.”

Another wile happened in Ephesus when the Apostle Paul was there. We read of it in Acts
19:23-41; 20:1. Demetrius, a silversmith, figured out that if images made with hands are not
considered gods by the masses of people the lack of demand for his images of the goddess Artemis
would put him into finical ruin. He told the other silversmiths that their livelihood
depended on this traffic of the images of Artemis. Furthermore the temple would fall into
disrepair. They stirred up several people of the population of Ephesus to riot against the
Christians shouting “Great is Artemis of Ephesians.” The town clerk said that the courts
were open and they could bring any charges to the court but there was no reason to riot. Paul then
left for Macedonia .

We may remember the stages of a wile.

1. Being approached with a false front.  2. Close approximation to the truth exaggerating
the negative.  3. Total lie exaggerating the positive.  4. Enamored by the wonderful
prospects  5.  Forget and disregard the truth; believe a lie and disobey God.

One must know and believe the truth. The battle ground is in our mind, which directs a
person’s actions. This is where knowledge of scripture is necessary. As is written in
Psalms 119:11, “Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.”

There must be a desire to do God’s will. A person must have a desire to do God’s will. Jesus
has this desire. Scripture records this in Psalms 40:8, “I delight to do thy will, O my God:
yea, thy law is within my heart.” Notice that the delight to do God’s will is accompanied by
knowledge of God’s word in the heart. Paul writes that Jesus was obedient to the point of
death. Philippians 2:8, “He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto  death, even the
death of the cross.”

The person who loves God will want to know what He says and will desire to do what He says. Jesus
states in John 14:21, “He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
me:”

Do you love God? If not, you can pray and ask God for help in loving Him. Posted by Sam at 10:02 AM 1

Sheriff Mack Speaks in Ohio



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FG1Hwu_WkrA/TcYIRNazpaI/AAAAAAAAFys/3Q03gcNEz5w/s400/SheriffMack03.jpg

Sheriff Richard Mack spoke this week in two locations in Ohio. I attended his presentation
today in Delaware, Ohio. Sheriff Mack is one of the sheriffs who sued President Clinton over
the implementation of the Brady Bill, which tried to implement stringent controls on the use
of guns throughout the U.S. Wikipedia explains, " Mack received national attention in Mack v.
United States (later restyled to  Printz v. United States ) in his tenure as a local sheriff
for opposition to the   Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act   on the basis that it is
unconstitutional due to congressional action to compel state officers to execute Federal
law."

He spoke about the state sovereignty issue and the need for local officials and we
the people to take back the freedoms we have lost through the years to the
expansion of powers by the federal government. One major point he made was that Socialism and
Freedom are incompatible. Mack says that there is a battle between the Constitutions of the
U.S. and various states and such anti-constitutional things as: Political Correctness,
Federal Programs, Federal Policies, Federal Regulations, and politicians who don't care
about their oath of office. Mack emphasized that the oath government officials take at every
level of government should mean something, but it in practice means little. This must
change. 

To learn more about the former Arizona Sheriff's work today see his websites at
www.SheriffMack.com or  www.CSPOA.org .

Sheriff Mack dedicated his presentation to Judge John Roll , who happened to be the district
judge who ruled in Sheriff Mack 's case originally and who was also the judge who was murdered in
the Tucson massacre at which the Congresswoman Giffords   was severely wounded. It was
informative that no mention of the judge's stellar constitutional judicial stance
was ever mentioned in his obituary or media coverage of his death. Mack also dedicated the
meeting to his mother, who had passed away this week. He gamely when ahead and made his two
presentations in Ohio saying his mother would have wanted him to do it. Tomorrow is Mother's
Day and I pray Sheriff Mack and his family will be comforted by God and the
positive remembrances of his mother.   Posted by gregjaye at 11:08 PM No comments:

National Day of Prayer

I was asked to lead a teaching time at the University of Cincinnati Christian Grads group for
the National Day of Prayer.  I gave each person in the group one or two scriptures to read about
the government or national repentance and then we prayed for America and other countries
around the world.



There is not much of the Day left, but take some time and read these passages, reflect on them and
ask God to help guide the leaders of all of the nations of the world in the way peace and liberty.

Liberty Galatians 5:13

Peace I Timothy 2:1-4

National Repentance 2 Chronicles 7:14

Nation Under God Psalms 33:12-22

Petition Signing on Election Day

This week I went to the polls where I collected signatures for the Ohio Healthcare Freedom
Amendment.  While I was there, there were other people collecting signatures for the repeal
of SB. 5.  The presence of the other petitioners was somewhat helpful to us and vice versa,
because some people who were held up signing the other petition would have walked away while I
getting someone else to sign.  One of the anti-SB. 5 guys was even handing out gospel tracts.



A few of the voters didn't want to sign any petitions--they did not even want to hear an
explanation of what the petitions were about.



On the other hand, some people signed both petitions, without hardly even a decent
explanation of it.  You just have to say "we just want to get this on the ballot so that the
voters can decide", and they sign.  (What if it was about putting Jews in concentration
camps?  "We just want to get it on the ballot"???!!!)  Dumb.



There were a few who signed mine, but not the SB. 5 repeal, but I think that there were a lot more
who signed it than mine.  This is particularly disturbing considering that this was in a very
conservative area.  I am getting a sense that, rightly or wrongly, a lot of policemen,
firefighters, and teachers are angry at the Republicans for enacting this SB. 5.  I've got a
bad feeling that the Republicans are going take a beating in Ohio, Wisconsin, and other
midwest states in 2012.  Not that a Republican sweep would necessarily be the best thing for
this country (that would depend on who they nominate), but retaining the Presidency and large
gains for the Democrats at all levels of government might just finish us off as a nation.



As for the SB. 5 bill itself, I am still undecided and I tend to think it is not the end of world
either if it is repealed or not.  But I have not read the bill, but have only glanced at it.
 Just reading the bill does not mean anything, though because its full of statements about
repealing, editing, or adding in words or short phrases to the Ohio Revised Code.  You can't
really see what it is about unless you read the portion of the Ohio Revised Code before and after
the change.  I doubt that very many of either the supporters or opposition to the repeal have
done that.  I think that, like a lot of other issues, both sides are exaggerating the effects
of this bill.  When I was asked if I would sign, I simply responded that I couldn't because I
hadn't read the bill.  With the Ohio Healthcare Freedom Amendment, it is different because
you can read what will be added to the state constitution right on the petition (and it is not
very long).  One petitioner for the repeal of SB. 5 told me that the bill would encourage jobs
to be filled by out of state workers.  (Well, if it somehow shows favoritism to them, then
yeah, I get your point, but if it treats out of state and in state applicants the same, then
what's the problem?)  I have heard that SB. 5 gets rid of some statewide rules for collective
bargaining, and gives more control to the local governments.  If this is really all it is, and
if the local governments can still have the choice of whether or not to have collecting
bargaining and determine the rules for it, then I'm all for SB. 5.  That is basically my
position on the issue, let the people who are served by the public employees decide how they are
paid, not people on the other side of the state. Posted by Matt at 10:32 PM No comments:

Obama Will Get No Hat Tip From Me

Why did Obama "do right thing" and get Osama?  Well, first of all Obama is obviously a puppet of
the New World Order and the corporations which contributed to his campaign.  His orders may
as well have come off of a teleprompter.  Secondly, it wasn't Obama who got him, it was the Navy
Seals.  And finally, I don't even know if all of this is real or not.  I am not entirely
convinced that Osama didn't die a long time ago, or isn't somehow still alive even.  I have no
real reason to believe the news media, the pentagon, and certainly not the White House.  So
whether the New World Order had some reason for taking out Osama or whether they had some reason
to make people think that he died, I don't know.  But it does seem to make people forget about
Libya, and this could boost Obama in the polls.  But the Bible says,

And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:  That
they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

Late Night Takes: Will Gadhafi be next to join Saddam & Osama?

The Tonight Show With Jay Leno





·      President Obama has done something that no one else has been able to do. He got
Donald Trump to shut up. ·      Saddam Hussein is dead, and Osama bin Laden is dead. If
you’re Moammar Gadhafi, living in exile is starting to sound really good. ·      NATO
bombed Gadhafi’s compound in Tripoli . The bombing damaged countless antique rugs and
curtains, leaving Gadhafi with absolutely nothing to wear.

Late Night With Jimmy Fallon





·      Rush Limbaugh said yesterday that Obama never would have tracked down bin Laden if
it weren’t for George W. Bush’s policies. Although in fairness, Obama never would have
even been elected if it weren’t for George W. Bush’s policies.

·      The good news: Osama bin Laden is dead. The bad news: there is no bad news. ·
     For their honeymoon, the royal couple wants to go somewhere they can have complete
privacy and no one in the country will give away their location. I think they’re going to
Pakistan .

Jimmy Kimmel Live!





·      I would like us to kill bin Laden every Sunday night. It makes for a much brighter
start to the week. ·      After all the talk about caves, bin Laden was hiding in a
million-dollar mansion in Pakistan . The CIA became suspicious when they learned there was a
million-dollar mansion in Pakistan . ·      I just want to point out that “buried at
sea” means “dumped in the ocean.” This could be the best Shark Week ever.
