Dan Carpenter Has No Sense Of History

Star columnist Dan Carpenter uses his column space today to fawn all over Sen. Barack Obama's
rock star appearance before a large German crowd, which had actually assembled to hear one of
Germany's most popular rock bands, when Obama stopped by and took the stage. Carpenter's
complete lack of history shines through as he compares Obama's speech to speeches given by two
former presidents (and I emphasize the word "president"), John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.
Carpenter says:



What's most interesting, in comparing Obama's moment with Kennedy's, Ronald Reagan's and
Bill Clinton's before him, is the perspective.



Their clarion calls for freedom came from a standpoint of national superiority, even
bellicosity in the Kennedy and Reagan cases. No less obviously than Obama , they were singing
to the choir back home. The difference, I would suggest, is that Obama wasn't settling for only
that audience; nor was he letting any audience settle for smug self-righteousness. His
keeper quote, if you will, is the sort of moral challenge I had given up hearing from anyone who
might reach the Oval Office: "The walls between the countries with the most and those with the
least cannot stand. The walls between races and tribes, natives and immigrants, Christian
and Muslim and Jew cannot stand. These now are the walls we must tear down."



So Carpenter thinks Kennedy's and Reagan's speeches were all about war-mongering and
national superiority. Does he have no sense of what the old Soviet Union empire represented to
the world and, more importantly, the European continent? Fortunately, there are still
learned Americans who haven't forgotten already. Victor David Hanson puts it into
perspective as he reacts to Obama's equating the United States to the tyrannical Soviet Union
(on foreign soil I might add). “The two superpowers that faced each other across the wall of
this city came too close too often to destroying all we have built and all that we love,” Obama
said. Hanson retorts:



I would beg to differ again, and suggest instead that a mass-murdering Soviet tyranny came
close to destroying the European continent (as it had, in fact, wiped out millions of its own
people) and much beyond as well — and was checked only by an often lone and caricatured US
superpower and its nuclear deterrence. When the Soviet Union collapsed, there was no danger
to the world from American nuclear weapons “destroying all we have built” — while the
inverse would not have been true, had nuclear and totalitarian communism prevailed. We sleep
too lightly tonight not because democratic Israel has obtained nuclear weapons, but because
a frightening Iran just might.



Kennedy and Reagan weren't speaking on behalf of the American people alone as Carpenter and
Obama would have us believe. They spoke on behalf of freedom-loving people in Europe and
elsewhere around the world who feared Soviet dominance would crush freedom in their country
just like it had throughout Eastern Europe. Does Carpenter forget how many millions of Jews
were killed at the hands of the Soviet dictators? I'm not surprised that Obama has no sense of
American history, but I would expect better of Carpenter. And this is not an issue of liberal
versus conservative. Posted by

Ed Treacy: Return Of The Living Dead?

Marion County GOP Chairman Tom John reacts to the election of Ed Treacy by the Marion County
Democrats as their new county chairman in a press release this evening:



"We have further evidence of the tired disarray in the Marion County Democrat Party. Tonight,
in their own version of Night of the Living Dead, the Democrats chose to exhume former chairman
Ed Treacy from the political graveyard. Rather than come up with fresh people or ideas,
Treacy's return serves as further proof that Democrats have nothing new to offer Marion
County."

With Friends Like Ludacris, Can Obama Win?

Grammy award-winning rapper Ludacris has a reputation for writing rap songs with
sexually-explicit lyrics which promote violence and disrespect for women. He's apparently
thought he could boost Sen. Barack Obama's presidential candidacy by writing a rap song about
how Sen. Hillary Clinton is an "irrelevant bitch" and how "McCain don't belong in ANY chair
unless he's paralyzed." "It's time to get out and vote! paint the White House black and I'm sure
that's got 'em terrified." Wow! Yeah, that's going to help Obama out a lot. You can listen to the
video by clicking here . Here are the lyrics to Ludacris' latest piece of work (Note how much
they bring home the point I made in my previous post):





I'm back on it like I just signed my record dealyeah the best is here, the Bentley Coup paint is
dripping wet, it got sex appeal never should have hated you never should've doubted him with a
slot in the president's iPod Obama shattered 'em Said I handled his biz and I'm one of his
favorite rappers Well give Luda a special pardon if I'm ever in the slammer Better yet put him in
office, make me your vice president Hillary hated on you, so that b^$&%* is irrelevant Jesse

McCain Campaign Picks Up On Obama's Celebrity Status

The campaign of GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain may have picked up on a theme which
will resonate with middle America. Sen. Obama's campaign is all about being a celebrity. When
you peel away the facade, there's no substance underneath. McCain campaign manager Rick
Davis calls Obama the "biggest celebrity in the world, comparable to Tom Cruise, Britney
Spears and Paris Hilton." One particular statement following Obama's foreign trip is biting
him hard and re-enforcing the perception of him as a narcissistic, egotist. Obama told a group
in Washington after his trip that he is the "symbol" for the world's aspirations for America
and that we are now at "the moment … that the world is waiting for." Yes, it's the arrival of the
new messiah . Davis says:



Only a celebrity of Barack Obama's magnitude could attract 200,000 fans in Berlin who
gathered for the mere opportunity to be in his presence. These are not supporters or even
voters, but fans fawning over The One. Only celebrities like Barack Obama go to the gym three
times a day, demand "MET-RX chocolate roasted-peanut protein bars and bottles of a
hard-to-find organic brew -- Black Forest Berry Honest Tea" and worry about the price of
arugula.



Yet, despite all of the fans, paparazzi and media adoration, the American people still have
questions: Is Barack Obama prepared to lead? Is being famous the same as being a credible
commander in chief?



Like most worldwide celebrities, this status has fueled a certain arrogance. As The
Washington Post reported this morning, Barack Obama has gone from his party's presumptive
nominee to "its presumptuous nominee." His advisers are constantly reminded that their
candidate is not actually the President of the United States, despite the "presidential"
seal. On his plane, his chair reads "President."



The arrogance of a man with so few accomplishments is really hard to stomach when you think
about it. The man has been a U.S. Senator for 3 years and has been campaigning for president for
more than half of that time. He was an undistinguished member of the Illinois Senate where he
engaged in "politics as usual", lining the pockets of his political contributors with
government contracts and jobs. The Washington Post's Richard Cohen hit one out of the
ballpark today with this simple question to those fawning over Obama's candidacy:



"'Just tell me one thing Barack Obama has done that you admire,' I asked a prominent Democrat.
He paused and then said that he admired Obama's speech to the Democratic convention in 2004. I
agreed. It was a hell of a speech, but it was just a speech. On the other hand, I continued, I could
cite four or five actions -- not speeches -- that John McCain has taken that elicit my
admiration, even my awe."



McCain's campaign manager has Obama pegged. "As the world's biggest celebrity, Barack Obama
has the entourage and all the trappings of fame," Davis says. "Today, his campaign is more
about advancing Barack Obama and less about solving the challenges facing our country." In my
view, Obama epitomizes everything I abhor about my generation. People of my generation
expect everything without working for anything. They look down upon and disrespect people
who've found their place through hard, honest work. They hate their parents for what they
aren't. They admire people who trample all over others resorting to any means, legal or
otherwise, to get that 5,000 square-feet home with a 3-car garage to fit their Lexus and BMW
automobiles. Ronald Reagan used to look at our country and say confidently that the best days
for America are still ahead of us. Does anyone really believe that anymore? Does the Obama
generation really have any respect for a 70-plus year-old former prisoner of war who
demonstrated unselfish valor in service to his country? Sadly, I think not. Posted by

Who Worked For The Russell Foundation?

Some of the subjects of an investigation into the misspent funds of the Russell Foundation
believe the news media and the blogs have been unfair in their reporting of the bankrupt
foundation. WRTV's Jack Rinehart broke the story first on the scandal surrounding the
foundation almost two weeks ago. He reported that a grand jury investigation was being
conducted to learn how as much as $1.5 million in funds may have been misspent by key persons
involved in the foundation. Rinehart reported:



According to the bankruptcy declaration obtained by 6News Friday, the foundation had racked
up more than $2.5 million worth of debt.



Records show the foundation's financial officers signed off on credit card bills of
$106,000, including $36,000 for office rugs.



The foundation also owned 17 vehicles, including a $50,000 Cadillac Escalade , and
maintained offices in a southeast side business park on lakefront property.



Authorities are also investigating missing funds that could total as much as $1.5 million,
according to court records, Rinehart reported.



Rinehart's report, quoting Russell Foundation President Bishop Michael Russell, said
Russell himself had initiated the bankruptcy filing and the reporting of the alleged missing
funds to the prosecutor's office. "The Russell Foundation and Bishop Michael Russell
welcome the investigation by authorities into the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of
dollars from Foundation bank accounts during 2006 and 2007," the statement from Russell's
attorney read. "The Foundation initiated the request that this matter be fully
investigated, and will continue to provide full cooperation with the investigators
assigned to the case." Rinehart's report indicated that search warrants had been executed on
City-County Councilor Paul Bateman and Manuel Gonzalez by the grand jury. In a later report by
the Star's Jon Murray, Bateman claimed he had been set up as a scapegoat and had done nothing
wrong. Bateman appeared to point the finger at Russell. "The bottom line is the guy used Jesus
Christ to pull us all in," Bateman said. "In the end, it was all a lie."



Although the bankruptcy filing lists Russell as the President of the foundation, a telephone
directory on the foundation's website omits his name. The phone directory , however,
contains a staggering 26 names of persons holding positions with the foundation and
identified as having a telephone extension at the foundation's headquarters at 4455
Southport Crossing Way in Indianapolis, which is now closed. That list includes Bateman and
Gonazales , who held key positions with the organization, but both claimed to work for the
foundation only as volunteers. You can bet most of the 26 people listed had no clue what was
going on with the spending and wish their names never appeared on the foundation's website.
With all of the important titles people were assigned, it's hard to understand why there
wasn't at least one person who provided a check and balance role in the foundation's spending
to avoid the $2.5 million bankruptcy the organization now faces. If Bateman and Gonzalez were
just volunteers, then who was actually employed by the foundation and had responsibility for
its day-to-day operations? The names and titles of the persons listed on the foundation's
telephone directory, include the following:



Patricia Anderson, Director of Funding Disbursement Compliance

Paul Bateman , Chief Corporate Officer

Darryl Borders, Corporate Financial Officer

Heather Bupp , Secretary/Receptionist

Patricia DeWalt , Director of Accounting

A.C. Ellis, Chief Structural Engineer

Janice Focht , Executive Secretary

Erika Fowler, Executive Secretary

Ron Franklin, Chief Corporate Director

Manuel Gonzalez, Chief Financial Advisor

Jennifer Greene, Office Manager

Dr. James Hill, Chief Grant Manager

Kelvin Jarrett, Director of Program Management

Elaine Johnson, Director of Human Resources

Dr. Kevin Jones, Chief Administrative Officer

Dr. Gloria King, Chief of Latino Affairs

Velveeta Knox, Chief Operations Officer

Dr. Roger Knutson , Chief of Technological Research

Kaiser Lowe, Corporate Counsel

Dr. Randall Sheppard, Director of Church Support Grants

Kenneth Torrance, Director of Cost Reimbursement & RF Program Grants

Dr. Elaine Walters, Chief Corporate Liaison

Monica Webster-Lowe, Corporate Counsel

Carline Wilkes, Accounting Manager

Andrea Womack , Director of Human/Social Service Grants

Does Size Matter?

A couple of Democratic blogs are featuring a video of Gov. Mitch Daniels entitled, "Don't Want
No Short Man Mitch." The photos give one the impression the knock is on Gov. Daniels' short
stature. Those familiar with the original song by Gillette entitled, "Don't Want No Short
Dick Man", understand what size means and it has nothing to do with a man's height. The
uncensored version of the song makes that abundantly clear, if the title doesn't. Posted by

Sam Carson A Volunteer For Mitch Daniels

Jim Shella blogs about how Sam Carson, son of the late U.S. Rep. Julia Carson (D), is a volunteer
for Mitch Daniels' re-election campaign . Sam Carson, the first cousin of U.S. Rep. Andre
Carson and son of Sam (the Daniels' volunteer), first announced last week and then almost as
quickly withdrew his candidacy for Marion Co. Democratic chairman against Ed Treacy. This
comes as no surprise to me. Perhaps no other person in the state of Indiana has made more money
off the Daniels administration than lobbyist Lacy Johnson, a powerful force behind the
Carson political machine. Recall that Johnson helped bring about businessman Bill Mays as a
major backer of Daniels in the African-American community four years ago. Johnson also
successfully lobbied Sen. Earline Rogers and Sen. Glenn Howard to back his Major Moves
program, which has made lots of money for Johnson's law firm, Ice Miller. Some believe that the
Daniels administration assigned former excise police officer Andre Carson to the
Department of Homeland Security to boost his credentials a year ahead of his planned run for
Congress this year. Also, Daniels' support for Jon Elrod in the special election was a bit hard
to detect. Think about it. If Sam Carson had managed to win the chairman's race against Treacy,
Ice Miller would have controlled both political parties in the county lock, stock and barrel.

Gallup Poll Puts McCain Ahead By Four Points

A USA Today/Gallup Poll released today gives Sen. John McCain a 4-point, 49%-45% lead in the
presidential race over Sen. Barack Obama. Those numbers are absolutely stunning given that
the poll was released after Obama's much ballyooed trip to the Middle East and Europe this past
week. Last month, this same poll showed McCain down by six points. Most polls still show Obama
with a slight lead. Over the years, I've found presidential polls taken prior to Labor Day to be
pretty useless. Syndicated columnist Robert Novak makes this point well in his column today.
Novak observes that Obama's lead over McCain in most polls is not nearly as good as that held by
Democratic candidates at similar points in past presidential elections. Novak writes:



In 1976, Jimmy Carter took a 33-point summer lead over President Gerald Ford and won in a photo
finish. In 1988, Michael Dukakis led George H.W. Bush by 17 points after being nominated in
Atlanta before he lost the election. Al Gore and John Kerry were ahead of George W. Bush in the
summer.



Novak notes that Obama's numbers, despite his lead, have remained below the 50% level,
suggesting he is far from closing the deal with voters. This suggests to Novak that McCain
could still back into a win despite the lousy campaign he is running. This will be Novak's last
column for awhile. He announced today he has been diagnosed with a brain tumor . This may
explain the confused state he seemed to be in last week when he was cited by D.C. police for
striking a pedestrian and driving away. Press coverage of this year's presidential race just
won't be the same with Tim Russert and now Robert Novak gone from the day-to-day coverage.

City's Finances Still Look Bleak

Even after a record 65% increase in the City's income tax, property tax increases and a $1
billion pension debt bailout by the State of Indiana, Indianapolis is still operating in the
red according to the Controller for the City of Indianapolis. The City will even have to take
out a $150 million loan just to make it through the year. Budget forecasts for the next few years
look even worse with expenditures expected to surpass revenues in the foreseeable future
unless drastic changes are made. This is what happens when you live beyond your means for so
many years. The opening of the $700 million Lucas Oil Stadium this month and the demolition of
the RCA Dome (despite owing $70 million on it) to make way for a $200 million convention center
expansion are emblematic of the recklessness with which the City has continued to borrow and
borrow beyond our means to repay it. According to the numbers released by the Ballard
administration today, expenditures for the 2008 budget are far exceeding the budget
approved by Mayor Peterson and the Democratic-controlled council last year--at least $30
million. With a source of revenue yet to be found to finance the operating and maintenance
expenses for Lucas Oil Stadium, the City is facing a much worse financial crisis than people
were led to believe during last year's budget debate. Posted by

Obama's Broken Promise To His African Tribe

The Evening Standard (a foreign publication) gives us the skinny on Sen. Barack Obama's true
character. Amid great fanfare, Obama visited the tribe of his family in Kenya and a school
named in his honor in 2006. During the visit, Obama promised assistance to the impoverished
community. Two years later, family and tribe members are faced with the reality that Obama
broke the promise he made to them. David Cohen writes:



The small brick house with no running water, a tin roof and roving chickens, goats and cows is
owned by Sarah Obama, Barack's 86-year-old step-grandmother. Inside, the walls are
decorated with a 2008 Obama election sticker, an old "Barack Obama for Senate" poster on which
he has written "Mama Sarah Habai [how are you?]", a 2005 calendar that says "The Kenyan Wonder
Boy in the US", and more than a dozen family photos.



But this bucolic scene in his father's village of Kogelo near the Equator in western Kenya
conceals a troubling reality that, until now, has never been spoken about. Barack Obama, the
Evening Standard can reveal, after we went to the village earlier this month, has failed to
honour the pledges of assistance that he made to a school named in his honour when he visited
here amid great fanfare two years ago.



Obama folks will no doubt quickly deny that Obama ever offered any financial assistance to the
school when he promised help. But even Obama's grandmother thought that was what he meant.
"When he comes down here, he will change the face of the school and, believe me, our poverty in
Kogelo will be a thing of the past," Cohen quotes 86-year-old Sarah Obama as saying to the
community. "Senator Obama has not honoured the promises he gave me when we met in 2006 and in his
earlier letter to the school," the school's principal now says. "He has not given us even one
shilling. But we still have hope."



Isn't it amazing that Sen. Obama can raise record sums of money to fund his own political
campaign, but he can't raise a few paltry bucks to help out the community of his own family in
Kenya? How difficult would it have been for him to call up a few of his Hollywood friends and
raise a few million bucks at a private fundraiser? His visit two years ago was all about another
photo op for his presidential campaign. Posted by

Allstate 400 Disappointing To Fans

The sight of Richard Petty wasn't enough to make up for what had to be the most disappointing
running of the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard. Problems with the Goodyear tires and numerous
scheduled cautions took the excitement out of the race, making it look more like a Formula One
race than a NASCAR race. Attendance was also noticeably down, reflecting the big economic
downturn the country is experiencing. Pole sitter Jimmie Johnson held off Carl Edwards to win
the race. The race saw no more than 12 laps of continuous green light racing at any point in the
race with about a third of the race being run under the caution lap. Posted by

Free Rock Concert Drew Crowd In Berlin, Not Obama

History repeats itself in this campaign. A couple of months back the news media failed to
mention a large crowd in Portland, Oregon gathered for a free concert in a park before Obama
took the stage. In Berlin, two very popular German bands played a free rock concert to lure
large crowds and the media failed to report it. The German band, Raemonn , is accustomed to
drawing large crowds as confirmed by this video . CNN's Christianne Armanpour looked rather
foolish trying to explain the lack of euphoria for Obama following his speech. “I did ask
some people as they were leaving what they thought," Armanpour said. "Everybody said good,
good. But I was surprised that there wasn't this sort of euphoria afterwards, given how many
people had come to listen and how much it had been anticipated." Psst . . . It was the free
concert, stupid. Posted by

The Meaning Of "Natural Born Citizen" And What It Means For Obama's Eligibility

A historian and former journalist, Judah Benjamin (a pseudoname), has put together a
scholarly paper on the meaning of the requirement in Article II of the U.S. Constitution that a
person be a "natural born citizen" in order to serve as president of the United States and what
it means for Sen. Barack Obama's eligibility for our nation's highest office. The paper is
laid out in a two-part series at the Texas Darlin blog. You will likely find his conclusion's
about the meaning of "natural born" surprising and be even more surprised by his conclusion
that Obama became an Indonesian citizen after his mother married his step father and moved the
family to Jakarta when Obama was six years old. Benjamin readily admits he is not a lawyer, but
his well-researched paper was reviewed by a constitutional lawyer at Columbia University
and an expert on Indonesian law.



Benjamin concludes that Obama is barred by Article II from serving as president of the United
States. His argument can be summed up as follows:



Barack Obama has been a citizen of multiple nations. And even if his citizenship outside the US
was renounced, Article II of the U.S. Constitution prohibits him from being President, for
the same reason that naturalized citizens are prohibited: divided loyalties.



Article II reads, “No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United
States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of
President." Benjamin goes to great pains in his paper to explain this clause does not have
anything to do with the location where you were born; rather, it's about one's allegiance and
loyalty to the United States. Quoting Justice Swayne from a precedent-setting case, U.S. v.
Rhodes , explaining Article II: “All persons born in the Allegiance of the King are Natural-
Born subjects, and all persons born in the Allegiance of the United States are Natural-Born
Citizens. Birth and Allegiance go together. Such is the Rule of the Common Law, and it is the
Common Law of this Country…since as before the Revolution.” Dual nationality,
according to Benjamin's article, is "impossible as a condition". That's why persons who have
become naturalized citizens are ineligible to be president Benjamin explains--because
they have had allegiance to another country. To the extent any law passed by Congress runs
counter to this understanding, Benjamin reminds us the Constitution will always trump a
statute no matter how long ago it was written or what people think of its import today.



Benjamin takes time in his article to address the brush up in the liberal media over Sen. John
McCain's eligibility to serve under Article II because of his birth in the Panama Canal Zone.
McCain’s parents, Benjamin explains were "serving as agents, or ambassadors, of their
country while serving in the Panama Canal Zone." Because McCain's parents had been sent to the
Panama Canal Zone by our government, their child "born abroad" would always be considered a
"natural born" citizen. To the extent McCain may have also been considered a "dual citizen"
under Panamanian law, Benjamin says that status would have been washed away when he joined the
U.S. Navy. Benjamin dismisses the notion that the 14th Amendment in any way altered the
requirement in Article II as suggested on Sen. Obama's Fight The Smears website and
elsewhere.



In Benjamin's analysis, Obama's problem has nothing to do with whether he was born in the U.S.
For purpose of his analysis, he assumes Obama was born in Hawaii as he claims. Obama's problem,
according to Benjamin, is that he has been a citizen of more than one country. And Benjamin's
main point of contention on this does not rest with his father's Kenyan nationality but rather
his conclusion that Obama became an Indonesian citizen. What? Yes, that's what Benjamin
believes based upon everything he has been able to review that is available in the public
record. Benjamin focuses on Obama's school records from STLP Asisi, his first Elementary
School. Benjamin says it is undisputed that his school records include the following
information:



He was enrolled on January 1st 1968, given Serial No 203 and placed in Class 1 B. His Religion is
given as Islam, his Nationality Indonesian, his Father’s Name as L Soetoro Ma., his
Father’s Occupation as Official, Director General’s Office TNI [Topography Division
Indonesian Army] and his Name as Barry Soetoro.



Based upon Benjamin's analysis of Indonesian law, Obama had to have been adopted by his step
father and changed his name to Soetoro. Under Indonesian law, Obama automatically became an
Indonesian citizen when his step father adopted him. Further, Benjamin supports his
contention based upon who was eligible to attend a state-run school at which he was later
enrolled--only Indonesian citizens. But how could Obama have later re-entered the U.S. as a
U.S. citizen and remained here all of these years? Benjamin surmises that Obama's mother
retained a U.S. passport for him, which he was issued based upon his birth in the state of
Hawaii. He left Jakarta using his Indonesian passport as Barry Soetoro when he was ten years
old and entered the U.S. on his American passport as Barack Obama, a practice Benjamin
describes as common but not legal. "There is clear prima facie evidence that Senator Barack
Hussein Obama has held at least two Citizenships, American and Indonesian, Benjamin
concludes. "Under Article II of the Constitution that disqualifies him for POTUS, and it
should."



Benjamin makes some interesting observations about the resolution the U.S. Senate passed
earlier this year to declare Sen. McCain a "natural born" citizen within the meaning of
Article II and, thus, eligible to serve as president. "Why were Democratic Senators trying to
pass a Resolution making Senator McCain undoubtedly legally eligible when this issue had
already been cleared up in 2000 and again in 2004?" Benjamin asks. He notes a particular
recital Sen. Obama and Sen. McCaskill insisted on adding to the resolution: “Whereas
previous presidential candidates were born outside of the United States of America and were
understood to be eligible to be President". According to Benjamin, based upon news reports,
Obama and McCaskill attempted to remove from the resolution this recital: "Whereas John
Sidney McCain, III, was born to American citizens on an American military base in the Panama
Canal Zone in 1936.” "It seems clear that McCaskill and Obama were attempting to create a
blanket Resolution covering ALL Foreign Born candidates," Benjamin opines. McCain did not
need this resolution in Benjamin's view. Posted by

Ethics Committee Votes To Censure Gray

It was supposed to be a bipartisan vote of the City-County Council Ethics Committee to decide
whether to censure former CCC President Monroe Gray for failing to disclose his business
relationship with a city contractor on his financial disclosure statement, but Democratic
member Paul Bateman resigned a few hours before the meeting because of an impending grand jury
investigation against his involvement in the Russell Foundation and Councilor Bill Oliver
didn't show up for the meeting. The Ethics Committee's two Republican members voted to
recommend a censure of Gray to the full council and forward a copy of its report to the Marion
County Prosecutor. "The entire intent of this committee was to restore confidence in the
public with City Council that we're doing things in an ethical way," the Star's Francesca
Jarosz quotes Councilor Pfisterer as saying about the recommendation. Marion Co.
Prosecutor referred Gray's case of alleged ghost employment at the Indianapolis Fire
Department to a special prosecutor last year. As with all of these cases of public corruption
in Marion County, nothing has become of Gray's case. Memo to U.S. Attorney's Office: HELP!

Obama's Health Care Plan

If you want an indication of what Sen. Barack Obama's plan is for health care, look no further
than how a big political supporter siphoned off money from pharmaceutical companies for a
foundation he created and then diverted the money to Obama's pal Tony Rezko, now sitting in
jail after being convicted on 16 charges of political corruption in federal court earlier
this year. Obama's good doctor friend, Dr. Paul S. Ray, set up a private foundation to support
medical research and education. This is what he did with the money according to the Sun-Times:



While on the county payroll, a top urologist at Cook County Hospital solicited nearly $1
million from drug companies over the last decade for his private foundation.



Dr. Paul S. Ray's pitch was that the money would go toward medical research and education.



But most of the money hasn't gone to health care at all. Instead, Ray invested it -- mostly in
Tony Rezko.



Rezko is the convicted influence-peddler who had been a prodigious fund-raiser for
politicians including Sen. Barack Obama, Gov. Blagojevich and the late Cook County Board
President John Stroger, the ultimate boss of the county hospitals.



Ray had long worked with Stroger's godson, Orlando Jones, a top administrator at Cook County
Hospital who became Stroger's chief of staff. Jones eventually left county government for a
job with Rezko. Last September, after he had been questioned by the FBI, Jones committed
suicide.



Ray set up the Paul S. Ray Urology Education and Research Foundation 16 years ago. It began
investing with Rezko's companies in 2002, according to reports Ray filed with the Internal
Revenue Service. The foundation invested $500,000 with Rezko Concessions, which operated
Panda Express and Papa John's Pizza restaurants. It also put $100,000 into a proposed housing
development Rezko unsuccessfully sought to build on a 62-acre site along the Chicago River in
the South Loop.



Ray, 63, of Chicago, also invested his own money with Rezko, spending millions to buy real
estate and Papa John's Pizza restaurants from Rezko.



Can someone explain to me how a health care foundation can invest money in a chain of pizza
restaurants? Oh yeah, you read my post earlier today on Indianapolis' Russell Foundation so
you know just how far awry corrupt people can get with these supposed nonprofit entities.
Well, this is where it gets really interesting. Ray's investments with Rezko didn't turn out
so well. Recall also that the feds weren't too happy when Tony Rezko showed up at Orlando Jones'
home a short time after he supposedly committed suicide when he was supposed to be on home
detention. Jones was a top administrator where Dr. Ray worked. Here's what the Sun-Times
tells us about Rezko's deals gone bad with Dr. Ray:





Ray's foundation appears to have lost the $500,000 it invested with Rezko Concessions --
nearly half of the foundation's assets. But the foundation apparently got back the $100,000
invested in Rezko's failed South Loop development.



Ray is battling lawsuits over two deals with Rezko. One was filed by Jabir Muhammad, a son of
Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad, claiming Rezko and Ray fraudulently took ownership
of the South Side mansion where Muhammad lives. The other involves a $646,949 loan Ray
allegedly got from a Rezko associate, Elie Maloof, to buy the Papa John's restaurants that
Rezko owned in Wisconsin.

Ray's purchase of those restaurants is part of a second, still-pending criminal case against
Rezko. Federal prosecutors say Rezko engaged in a conspiracy so Ray could buy the Papa John's
stores in Wisconsin. Ray -- who has not been charged -- has been granted immunity from
prosecution to testify against Rezko.



Yeah, you read that right. Ray and Rezko are entangled in a dispute with the Nation of Islam
founder's son over the ownership of his Southside mansion. Recall that Rezko played an
instrumental role in helping Sen. Obama purchase his Southside mansion not too far away from
Muhammad's mansion. Note that reports indicate that Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam has
provided assistance to Obama's campaign from the get go. And what about that $6,000 Ray
contributed to Obama's Senate campaign? Obama contributed it to charity after details of his
financial entanglements with Rezko emerged publicly. Wake up America! Posted by

Russell Foundation Scandal Turning Heads

The Russell Foundation describes itself as "a Christian faith-based organization that
recognizes that all people are made of one blood, and therefore should co-exist as one body of
people upon the earth, living in various nations, yet emanating from the same instance of
human origin." People knowledgeable with the grand jury investigation of the nonprofit
organization in the wake of its recent bankruptcy filing describe a small group of
individuals squeezing every last ounce of blood out of the organization for their own
personal benefit. There are tales of a California clothier being flown into town to fit the men
in charge with the finest in tailored suits. The women had to settle for the best that
Nordstroms had to offer. A northside jeweler crafted gold rings with "RF" initials to
distinguish the illustrious crew doing God's work. Exotic rugs were purchased and then
disappeared without the bill ever being paid. And a high-ranking Indianapolis police
department official pulled double-duty as "chief of security" for the group. An IMPD police
cruiser couldnt' cut it. He had a Cadillac Escalade to make his important rounds.



As the Star's Jon Murray notes in his story yesterday , it is estimated that at least $1 million
was misappropriated by key officials within the organization. All totalled, the
foundation's filing lists more than $2.5 million in debts and assets of just $235,000. A grand
jury investigation is focusing on three individuals, Rev. Michael Russell, Indianapolis
City County Councilor Paul Bateman and Manuel Gonzalez. While one of the investigated is
protesting his innocence, a source close to the investigation says the individual cannot
account for nearly $500,000 in foundation expenditures. The foundation accumulated at one
point about 17 cars, most of which are identified in the bankruptcy filing. The source says
forged signatures allowed one of the individuals to get hold of nearly $100,000 using a
financing scheme through a Connersville car dealer for cars already purchased.



The source suspects the individuals in charge of the foundation went on the spending spree in
anticipation of an $11 million investment from an outside investment firm. There were big
plans. Talks with some of the country's wealthiest businessmen in America were supposedly
underway--hence the need for a "chief of security". The focus was no longer on helping
inner-city poor with housing and other needs. There was big talk of a high speed monorail from
Indianapolis to Chicago, tapping a closed down steel mill in Northwest Indiana that would
help put many unemployed in Da Region to work. Ethanol production was planned. It all required
lots of walking around money we're told. Cash-filled wallets were needed to work the halls at
the State House and our nation's capitol to win support for the foundation's projects
according to one tale.



The matter is now in the hands of a Marion County grand jury. The Star's Jon Murray writes,
"Earlier this month, investigators seized computers, files and financial documents from
the foundation's headquarters on Indianapolis' Far Southside, according to court
records." "Another search of Gonzalez's home resulted in the seizure of a computer and
records." Murray's article notes that a grand jury investigated another nonprofit run by
Russell's former wife in 2004. "The center's board accused Russell's then-wife, Executive
Director Florence Alexander, of financial malfeasance, spurring a search of the
Near-Northside community center by Brizzi's grand jury investigators," Murray writes. "No
charges resulted, but the center later went into receivership." Will this investigation end
the same way? Who knows. I would feel more confident if the feds stepped in and took over this
investigation, particularly since the allegations involve a federal tax-exempt
organization.



UPDATE: The Star's Jon Murray reports on the resignation of Councilor Paul Bateman as a member
of the Council's Ethics Committee following news of the investigation of the Russell
Foundation. Marion Co. GOP Chairman Tom John called for Bateman's resignation from the panel
at a press conference outside the City-County Building earlier today.



UPDATE II: An observant AI reader brought to my attention this story from the July 5, 2008 Gary
Post-Tribune discussing the death of the planned monorail by the Russell Foundation. John
Byrne wrote:





This time last year, Northwest Indiana was abuzz with the possibilities of a space age public
transit system and hundreds of local jobs to support it.

Remember the monorail from East Chicago to Indianapolis? Well, it apparently has become yet
another of the region's transportation pipe dreams.



Much ink was spilled over the plan, which investors first unveiled to state legislators in
spring 2007.



A silent, ecologically sound train could carry people and freight between East Chicago and
Indianapolis, a model for the rest of the nation.



Best of all, it wouldn't cost the public a dime to build.



The Westminster International Corp., a Montana investment group, would front all the money
to build the transporter on existing railroad right-of-way, company spokesman Richard
Shafsky told a group of local officials in Merrillville last year.



And better yet, Shafsky said the company would reopen a local steel mill to construct monorail
infrastructure and sell it around the country.



On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Shafsky said a lack of political support locally killed the
monorail plan.



"It never got past the initial discussions," said a representative for Shafsky who declined
to give her full name.



Area political consultant Joe Gomeztagle worked on behalf of the monorail investment group
-- which included the faith-based Indianapolis non-profit the Russell Foundation -- to
coordinate discussions with decision makers along the proposed route between Lake Michigan
and the state capital.



Gomeztagle said he recently received word from Russell Foundation lawyers that the group had
declared bankruptcy.



"I was worried as this went along that they would give people around here hope for this monorail
proposal and then it wouldn't work out," Gomeztagle said.



Russell Foundation attorneys were not available this week to discuss the agency.



A telephone number listed on the Russell Foundation Web page has been disconnected.

Superdelegate Andrew Misled On Residency; Didn't Vote In Indiana Primary

The former head of the Indiana Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee misled
the public when he announced on the eve of Indiana's Democratic primary in May that he was
changing his allegiance from Sen. Hillary Clinton to Sen. Barack Obama . The late move miffed
the Clinton campaign and Sen. Evan Bayh . Andrew was originally slotted to be a superdelegate
from the State of Maryland, but he convinced party officials to move his superdelegate status
to Indiana based on the understanding he supported Clinton for president. When Andrew
announced his switch, he was criticized for no longer being a resident of Indiana. WISH- TV's
Jim Shella notes Andrew's defense then:



"I was born here. I own a house here and I happen to work in Washington just like every United
State Senator and Congressman does," said Andrew.



Well, not quite. As Jim Shella points out, the Carmel house Andrew once owned is now owned by
Colts owner Jim Irsay . Shella also reports that Andrew did not vote in the Indiana primary
because he isn't a registered voter here. "Several attempts to contact Andrew for comment,
both at his Washington law office and through associates in Indianapolis, were
unsuccessful," Shella reports. "Should Andrew be in the Indiana delegation to the Denver
convention?" Shella asks. Here's the real shocker. Andrew didn't vote in the Maryland
primary, either. Posted by

Class Action Lawsuit Filed To Recover Pan Am Plaza Funds

Attorney Paul Ogden made good on his promise and filed a class action lawsuit in Marion
Superior Court 13 to recover at least $6 million from the recent sale of Pan Am Plaza property by
the Indiana Sports Corporation to private developers, which was supposed to be repaid to the
City of Indianapolis as part of a restrictive covenant the City entered into with the ISC when
it gave the property to ISC in 1985. The administration of Mayor Bart Peterson rushed through
an amendment to the original development agreement which let ISC off the hook for repayment so
it could sell of the land for a price the ISC has refused to disclose publicly. The rush to close
the deal before Peterson's term ended circumvented the law according to Ogden's suit.
Ogden's suit notes the following deficiencies:



    

    - The resolution approved by the Metropolitan Development Commission made no mention of
    the original restrictive covenant.

    

    - The resolution omitted the fact that the amendment to the 1985 development agreement
    would cause the City to give up $6 million.

    

    - The resolution was approved by MDC on a voice vote along with other proposals without any
    public debate.

    

    - The City is still paying debt obligation for the original cost of purchasing the Pan Am
    Plaza property, which was rolled into the bond obligations for Circle Centre Mall.

    

    - State law required Mayor Peterson to bring the proposed change in the redevelopment
    plan to the City-County Council.

    

    - State law required that there be notice of the proposed modification in the
    redevelopment plan, information provided to the public at at public hearing, and an
    opportunity for the public to remonstrate or object to the change--all after the council
    approved the resolution.

    

    - The Metropolitan Commission was required to take final action determining the public
    utility and benefit of the proposed project.

    

    - And finally, because the property interest in the covenant exceeded $50,000,
    City-County Council approval was required.

    



Hat tip to the Indiana Law Blog, which has more here . See my earlier post on this subject here .
Ogden's suit notes that the original development agreement was signed by Michael Browning in
his capacity as Vice President of the ISC. Browning's company was later awarded the right to
redevelop the property on behalf of the ISC. The ISC recently sold the property in question to a
development group including Kite Realty Group. Kite was a major contributor to Mayor Bart
Peterson. Posted by

When The Kids Aren't At School

Lawrence Township Trustee Mike Hobbs works as a volunteer at John Marshall Community High
School. When attendance numbers hovered around 50% recently, Hobbs decided something
needed to be done to incentivize parents to make sure their kids are in school. He and John
Marshall principal, Jeff White, came up with a plan. Any parent with a case pending in Hobbs'
office for rent, utility, food or other emergency assistance will see their case held up if
their children are enrolled at John Marshall but they aren't attending classes. This will
provide a little extra incentive to the parents to be responsible in ensuring their kids are in
school. And if they're in class instead of on the streets, there is less chance they will be
getting into trouble. What do you think? Posted by

Advocates Against Domestic Violence Blame Denial Of Protective Order For Woman's Death

A double-homicide and suicide arising out of a domestic dispute this morning has advocates
against domestic violence blaming the denial of a protective order for today's tragedy.
According to WISH-TV, April Wills requested a protective order against her ex-husband, Carl
Wills. Instead of being granted a traditional protective order, Marion County granted Wills
what is known as a "non-violent contact order."



"Most other counties don't even entertain the idea of a non-violent contact order because a
non-violent contact order is an order that says it's okay to have contact with somebody as long
as it's not violent," said Kerry Hyatt Blomquist of the Coalition Against Domestic Violence.



Advocates tell WISH-TV that there has been a growing trend in Marion County to issue a
"non-violent contact order." In addition to beating another woman last fall, Carl Wills had
the following run-ins with his ex-wife over the last several months according to the Star:



In June 2007, Wills knocked on the door of his ex-wife’s Winterberry Drive apartment. When
she did not answer, according to a report, he slashed a tire on her car.



In April 2007, Wills kicked in the door of April Wills’ apartment in the 3600 block of Green
Ash Court, according to another report, and fled the scene before police arrived.



In January 2006, police arrested Wills for domestic battery after he reportedly punched
April in the face and body at an apartment in the 4200 block of Majestic Lane.



Not surprisingly, Wills had a prior conviction for reckless homicide from 1992. According to
the Star, he served 7 years of his 8-year sentence. Posted by

Scratch John Edwards From Obama's VP List

No sooner had Time confirmed that former Sen. John Edwards was on Obama's short list for vice
president than the National Enquirer broke a story alleging that its reporters caught up with
Edwards at the Beverly Hilton after he left a hotel room of a woman at 2:40 a.m. this morning who
the tabloid claims gave birth to a child belonging to Edwards. According to the tabloid
report, Edwards hid out in the hotel's basement bathroom until security arrived to help
escort him out of the hotel after its reporters confronted him about his alleged meeting in the
hotel room of Rielle Hunter and his supposed love child. Hunter once did filming work for
Edwards' presidential campaign. Edwards wife, Elizabeth, is still being treated for
cancer. Assuming Edwards had any chance of landing a spot on the ticket with Obama, this news
will certainly wash it away. Posted by

Indiana Wins Highest Credit Rating

Standard & Poor's Rating Service has upgraded Indiana's credit rating to AAA, the first time
in the state's history that it has achieved this status. Gov. Mitch Daniels jumps on the
announcement. "The upgrade reflects the state's continued strong management that has led to
the property tax reform that has realigned state and local spending and is not expected to
impact the state's long-term financial performance," Daniels said. A press release from the
governor's office notes that schools will be able to borrow money at a lower interest rate as a
result of the upgrade. Only nine other states enjoy a AAA rating from S&P, including Florida,
Georgia, North Carolina, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri and Utah.

Is Jindal McCain's Pick?



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hi9W7dbsNYY/SIUiWIF_CQI/AAAAAAAAAwc/NVv0GbP_fqc/s200/jindal.jpg
Political columnist Bob Novak is reporting that Sen. John McCain may announce his vice
presidential choice this week. According to Novak , the current favorite is former Gov. Mitt
Romney. The Fix' Chris Cilizza notes that Sen. McCain is scheduled to travel to New Orleans
later this week to meet with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal . The 37-year-old is considered a
rising star in the Republican Party. Despite his young age, Democrats could ill-afford to
criticize him as unqualified. His resume is much more impressive than Sen. Barack Obama's ,
the presumptive Democratic nominee. He was elected to Congress the same year Obama was
elected to the Senate, and last year he won election as governor. He ran the Louisiana
Department of Health under former Gov. Mike Foster. He served as executive director of the
National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, a 17-member panel charged with
devising plans to reform Medicare. He later served as Assistant Secretary of Health and Human
Services in the Bush Administration, an appointment which required Senate confirmation.
Jindal would become the first Indian-American to land on the national ticket of either party.
Piyush is his birth name. He adopted the nickname Bobby after the Bobby Brady character from
the "Brady Bunch."

Jobs For Ex-Offenders A Top Priority For Ballard

Mayor Greg Ballard is putting his full support behind an effort to encourage Indianapolis
employers to hire ex-offenders. Colts Coach Tony Dungy has agreed to chair Ballard's
"Ex-Offender Re-entry Program." Ballard's plan not only includes an effort to place
ex-offenders in city and county jobs but also a preference in city contracting for businesses
which agree to employ ex-offenders. A city ordinance is required to enact the bidding
preference. It is this latter proposal which is likely to draw the ire of some in the business
community and elsewhere.



The city is already providing preferences to women and minority-owned businesses. Mayor
Ballard recently added another preference category for veterans. The net effect of all these
preferences is to disadvantage male and white-owned businesses which seek to employ the best
employees available. Hiring ex-offenders could prove both costly and too risky for these
small business owners. It is also counter-intuitive. Are law-abiding people going to lose
out to job opportunities because a would-be employer had to hire an ex-offender to win or
retain a city contract?



Whenever I read about ideas like this one I'm reminded of William Bennett's, "The Book Of
Virtues." We've become a society which rewards bad behavior and punishes good behavior. We
need programs which reward good behavior. It's as if virtue has become a vice. Just wait and see
who has their hands out first to get a piece of the taxpayer money needed to fund this program.
The same old "do- gooders " who've been feeding at the public trough for years. Who is going to be
held to account when a public employee is harmed by the violent act of an ex-offender this
program compelled to be hired? Or when public funds or property turns up missing because the
city compelled the hiring of a person with a prior theft-related conviction?



Of course, the big proponent of this plan is Deputy Mayor Olgen Williams, a convicted felon who
stole from the U.S. Post Office while employed there to feed his drug habit. Although there is
evidence Williams turned his life around and successfully obtained a presidential pardon so
he could run for public office in Indiana, in my mind, his past criminal record should have
disqualified him from holding such a high-ranking position in our city government. Mayor
Ballard obviously thinks much differently than I do on this point, and he wants to fill city
government jobs with more people just like Williams. I know there are many people who think I'm
being too hard-lined on this particular issue. My parents spent a great deal of time teaching
their children the importance of understanding right from wrong. It is very disheartening to
see so much reward in our society today for people who abandon this important principle for the
quick gain. As long as we continue to embrace a society where there are no bad consequences for
bad behavior, we shouldn't be surprised at how badly people behave. I guess the motto "Do The
Crime, Do The Time" has been replaced by "Do The Crime, Reap The Reward." Posted by

Investor's Business Daily Knocks Obama's Reliance On Lugar

Indiana Daily Insight picks up on a knock in an Investor's Business Daily editorial of Sen.
Barack Obama's use of Sen. Richard Lugar in his latest ad to bolster his foreign policy
credentials. IDI's Ed Feigenbaum writes, "Investor's Business Daily editorializes
negatively about 'The Obama-Lugar 'Coalition', suggesting that U.S. Sen. 'Barack Obama has
a curious way of trying to hoodwink voters into believing he is more hawkish than they think —
by showing them how pally he is with a leading Republican dove.'" The editorial puts into
perspective the non-role Obama has actually played in eliminating Russian nuclear weapons
and Lugar's own misjudgments on Iraq:



Obama claims he and Lugar kept Russian nuclear weapons out of the wrong hands. But beyond
getting a tour of a junkyard for old warheads in Russia in 2005, and supporting
Lugar-sponsored missile legislation, it's actually unclear what Obama did.



Lugar is a poor choice of Republican for Obama to pair up with in feigning foreign policy
credibility. The last thing Lugar did of any note was deliver an interminable speech on the
Senate floor a year ago. In those remarks, he complained that 'our continuing absorption with
military activities in Iraq is limiting our diplomatic assertiveness there and elsewhere in
the world.' He called for 'a multifaceted diplomatic offensive' instead of President Bush's
military surge.



Lugar's betrayal was described as historic by the Senate's top Democrat, Harry Reid.
Portrayed in much of the media as a foreign-policy wise man, Lugar and his advice proved dead
wrong. Had his counsel been followed last year, a chaotic Iraq would be dominated today by
al-Qaida and Iran.



Now Lugar is actually being mentioned as a possible cross-party running mate for Obama. The
Hoosier claims no interest, but back at the 1980 Republican convention in Detroit the
then-little-known senator was almost begging publicly to be placed on the ticket with Ronald
Reagan .... Lugar later sowed distrust with Republicans when he suggested selling out
Nicaragua's Contra freedom fighters in the 1980s in exchange for a communist Sandinista
version of 'free elections.'



Now, in an election year, Lugar describes the assertions in Obama's commercial as 'accurate'
— rather than taking the opportunity to blast Obama's naive foreign-policy radicalism."

Krauthammer On The "Audacity Of Vanity"

Charles Krauthammer pens a salient column in the Washington Post on Sen. Barack Obama's
attempt to stage at speech at Brandenburg Gate in Berlin as a nice photo-op for his general
election campaign against Sen. John McCain. German Chancellor Angela Merkel rightfully
pointed the egotistical candidate in another direction. As Krauthammer points out in his
column, Obama, unlike Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, has not earned the right
to speak at this historic site. Krauthammer writes:



What Obama does not seem to understand is that the Brandenburg Gate is something you earn.
President Ronald Reagan earned the right to speak there because his relentless pressure had
brought the Soviet empire to its knees and

he was demanding its final "tear down this wall" liquidation. When President John F. Kennedy
visited the Brandenburg Gate on the day of his "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech, he was
representing a country that was prepared to go to the brink of nuclear war to defend West
Berlin.



Who is Obama representing? And what exactly has he done in his lifetime to merit appropriating
the Brandenburg Gate as a campaign prop? What was his role in the fight against communism, the
liberation of Eastern Europe, the creation of what George Bush the elder -- who presided over
the fall of the Berlin Wall but modestly declined to go there for a victory lap -- called "a
Europe whole and free"?



Krauthammer could have also said that both Kennedy and Reagan served their country during
World War II. Kennedy shunned the advantage a privileged life as the son of an ambassador
brought him and put his life in harm's way. Reagan set aside his budding movie career for a new
role acting in training videos for the military. Although not a life threatening role as
Kennedy's, the actor served the role his country asked of him. Obama can point to no such
service for his country.



Krauthammer goes a step further and picks up on the narcissistic nature that many Americans
are just now beginning to learn about Obama. Krauthammer wonders how a politician with so
little in the way of achievement could have such an inflated opininon of himself:



Every senator looks in the mirror and sees a president. Nonetheless, has there ever been a
presidential nominee with a wider gap between his estimation of himself and the sum total of
his lifetime achievements?



Obama is a three-year senator without a single important legislative achievement to his
name, a former Illinois state senator who voted "present" nearly 130 times. As president of
the Harvard Law Review, as law professor and as legislator, has he ever produced a single
notable piece of scholarship? Written a single memorable article? His most memorable work is
a biography of his favorite subject: himself . . .



Obama may think he's King Canute, but the good king ordered the tides to halt precisely to
refute sycophantic aides who suggested that he had such power. Obama has no such modesty.



Krauthammer's closing is perfect. "As he said on victory night, his rise marks the moment when
'our planet began to heal.' As I recall -- I'm no expert on this -- Jesus practiced his healing
just on the sick. Obama operates on a larger canvas." Isn't it refreshing to see a Washington
pundit with an objective perspective on Obama? This craziness has got to end. Never before has
someone so unqualified to be president been elevated to represent so much more than what he
truly is. Posted by

John Criticizes Ballard For Transparency

The Star's Brendan O'Shaughnessy takes a look at Mayor Greg Ballard's performance half way
through his first year. That outgoing Marion Co. Democratic Chairman Mike O'Connor and close
advisor to former Mayor Bart Peterson directs criticism at Ballard's performance is no
surprise. Criticism from the Mayor County GOP Chairman, though, is a different matter. Tom
John, a newly-minted Ice Miller partner, thinks Mayor Ballard is making a mistake by allowing
the public access to performance reviews prepared by his Administration and promising to
hold public budget reviews. "Any time you wade into something you can't control, there's a
risk someone could stand behind you and shoot arrows in your back," John said.



The public access to performance reviews, which John doesn't want open to the public, is the
new IndyStat site on the Mayor's website, described as "Accountability In Action For The City
Of Indianapolis." The Mayor's Office of Enterprise Development conducts regular
performance evaluations of various agencies of city/county government to review spending
and performance data and to determine areas for need of improvement or change. If you want to
peek inside your government, this is the place to go. The site puts key data and critical
analysis prepared by the Office's Mike Huber and Kristen Tusing at your fingertips. It's also
all public information, so it's not like Mayor Ballard is giving us access to information to
which we aren't entitled. And it's entirely in keeping with his promise to bring transparency
to government. As I recall, John himself issued several press releases during last year's
campaign touting transparency in government and, specifically, criticizing Mayor
Peterson and the Democratic-controlled council for shutting the public out of the City's
budget process. Why John chose to hit Ballard on this of all subjects is beyond me. I think he
must have had his Ice Miller hat on instead of his county chairman's hat when O'Shaughnessy
interviewed him for this story, although I suspect his partners wished he had worn the latter
for this interview.



The criticism Mike O'Connor directs at Ballard is that he's acting too much like a
"caretaker." "The mayor (should be) the community cheerleader, the clearinghouse when
there is a crisis, the only person who can build consensus," O'Connor told O'Shaughnessy. The
Star's editors picked up on this theme last week, suggesting that Ballard was missing in
action on the City's continued crime problem and policing concerns. I have issues with his
approach on a number of issues, but I think the Mayor has been very visible and highly-engaged
on these and other issues. The "caretaker" description used by O'Connor is actually more
descriptive of his former boss' management style. He showed up for a lot of photo-ops but
otherwise seemed to leave it to others to do the heavy lifting. I think Robert Vane summarizes
this point best with his comment. "Voters decided they wanted a workhorse, not a show horse,
and that's what they got," Vane said.



Overall, I was somewhat disappointed in the story. The sidebar to the story contains more
useful information than the story itself. Many of Ballard's supporters are disappointed in
some of his actions to date, but this story really didn't touch on it. Turning to the same
political insiders for key jobs in his administration has been a source of irritation to many.
Providing such an enlarged role in his administration to Rev. Olgen Williams and his minister
friends, who played absolutely no role in Mayor Ballard's election last year (and,
theoretically, if not legally, should never play a role in politics), has been perplexing and
alienating to his core supporters. And Ballard's slowness in implementing promised ethics
reforms has signaled more business as usual. At the end of the day, however, Ballard's
administration is a refreshing change from the corrupt and out of touch Peterson years.
There's still plenty of time for Ballard to get his act together. Let's hope he's listening.

Drive-By Prayer Minister's Daughter Murdered

Rev. Malachi Walker has been on the forefront of the Peace In The Streets initiative and
conducts neighborhood prayer gatherings in troubled areas of Indianapolis known as Drive By
Prayers to discourage youth from taking up crime. Early this morning, his 24-year-old
daughter, Chanelle Wells, became the City's latest homicide victim . Someone broke into her
home on the City's Far E astside and shot her multiple times. Police found a handgun, two AK47s
and marijuana in her home. Wells leaves behind three children ranging in age from 5 months to 6.
She became the 70 th homicide victim of the year. Posted by

Ivy Tech Wants To Demolish Historic Building

Ivy Tech won state and city approval for a $69 million construction project at the site of its
near northside campus in Indianapolis along Fall Creek with the understanding it would
preserve the historic former St. Vincent Hospital Building facing Fall Creek as you cross the
bridge on Meridian Street. Now, Ivy Tech officials have presented drawings which propose to
raze the historic building, along with all the surrounding buildings. This, according to the
IBJ's Cory Schouten , has the Indiana Historic Landmarks Foundation in an uproar.



As with anything Ivy Tech does, politics seems to have a role in the project. Schouten notes
that Ivy Tech dumped its former architect on the project, Jim Schellinger's CSO Architects,
and replaced it with Schmidt Associates, a big contributor to Gov. Mitch Daniels'
re-election bid.



From the outside, the old St. Vincent Hospital appears to be a real treasure and certainly a
landmark building for the Fall Creek neighborhood. It really is a gateway of sorts as it stands
facing the greenway along Fall Creek Parkway. Judging by the comments on Schouten's Property
Lines blog, people aren't real cracked up about the proposed replacement building. Some
describe it as looking like one of those suburban warehouse buildings. Posted by

Stopped While Driving White In A Black Neighborhood

Last February, I attended a Mayor's Night Out at the Jubilee Center on the City's near
northside . Public Safety Director Scott Newman told the gathered neighborhood residents to
expect stepped up enforcement as a means of getting guns out of the hands of felons. Newman told
the gathering that routine traffic stops are an effective and legal means of accomplishing
this objective. Let's put this policy to the test.



I spoke tonight to a prominent neighborhood leader and local business owner who was subjected
to one of these "routine traffic stops." Shortly after this fine gentleman, who happens to be
Caucasian, left a black friend's home in the area of West 29 th Street, he was tailed by an IMPD
officer. After traveling about five blocks, the officer turned on his lights and pulled him
over. The officer approached him and demanded to know why he was "buying crack in a black
neighborhood ." His efforts to explain to the officer that he had simply been visiting a friend
in the neighborhood weren't succeeding. "Why are you shaking," the officer demanded of him.
As his nightmare continued, six police officers gathered at the scene. He found himself being
patted down with his hands on the hood of the car. Drug sniffing dogs were brought to the scene to
search his car. In a particularly embarrassing moment, a client of the businessman drove by
among many others, looking on in shock at what he had just witnessed. The officer relentlessly
badgered him for answers about his whereabouts. Finally, after nearly an hour, the officer
tossed his driver's license, registration and proof of insurance onto the street. "You got
lucky today," the officer said as he walked away.



If Scott Newman believes that routine traffic stops such as the one this man encountered at
6:45 a.m. this past Monday is legal, then he better head back to law school. This police officer
had absolutely no probable cause for pulling this man over other than his belief that a white
man should not be driving in this particular black neighborhood at that time of day. The victim
in this case has filed a complaint with the City. If the City is wise, a public apology will be
immediately issued to this man for the police officer's gross misconduct. I think we all share
a commitment to bringing crime under control in Indianapolis. But this kind of police
misconduct cannot be tolerated for a moment. If you want to stop someone for speeding,
ignoring a stop sign or driving with a headlight out, that's fine. Profiling drivers based on
race in a particular setting, black or white, stopping them and then subjecting them to
unreasonable searches and detentions is simply unacceptable. Posted by

Ballard Has Plan To Clean Up Police Department

Public Safety Director Scott Newman announced a plan to get tough on bad cops in the wake of more
than a half dozen police officers being arrested since the first of the year for a variety of
crimes. "Nothing can substitute for honest men and women who understand thattheir career as
police is a sacred trust they hold for the public," Newman said. "Still, it is incumbent on us to
make sure that every safeguard is put inplace to channel those men and women in the right
direction, and to helpus find out quickly when they have gone the wrong direction." "We are
ashamed of the actions of the few, but we are proud of the actions of the many, and we won't
hesitate to use these measures that we announce today and others to make sure the bad apples are
plucked out and tossed aside." Here are the steps Newman outlined at yesterday's press
conference:



    

    - More intensive supervision of officers in the field.

    

    - Tighter accounting and inventory controls of search warrants and seizures of drugs and
    money.

    

    - Bringing back the previous practice of polygraph tests for officers assigned to
    narcotics enforcement, vice, intelligence and property room.

    

    - Creating the position of recruiter in order to ensure the departmentattracts the best,
    high quality candidates, including establishing apresence on college campuses.

    

    - Establishing a staffed Office of Career Development with the task of guiding officers
    toward more directed career goals, cultivating management and leadership skills, and
    providing more consistent evaluations and training.

    

    - Requiring performance evaluations on a regular basis.

Photographers Shot At Eastside Fire

A WISH-TV photographer and a freelance photographer were shot early this morning while
firefighters fought a blaze at an abandoned house in the 800 block of N. Tacoma Street. A
firefighter's air tank was also hit. Both shooting victims were taken to Methodist Hospital
according to the Star's Tom Spalding. WISH-TV's Kevin Hankins has been released. "I was just
gathering shots around the scene and then all of sudden heard a pop and felt something on my left
back," said Hankins. Fox59 News is reporting a fire at a second abandoned house. You may recall
that Indianapolis suffered a rash of fires at abandoned homes on the City's southeast side
last year. Also, Fox News reports that a shooting outside Club Industry this morning led to a
high speed chase by police ending with a rollover of the fleeing SUV on Keystone Avenue. Just
another night in the City. Posted by

Obama Influence Peddler Cashing In Early

For the Obama folks, the election in November is a mere formality. In their minds, the race is
already over and Obama is simply taking a five-month long victory lap to the White House. This
is particularly true with the sleazy influence peddlers who surround Obama. Long-time Obama
friend, former staffer and political advisor Dan Shomon offers us a taste of that "Change"
Obama promises to bring to Washington in this pitch for his government affairs practice:



“Should ‘CHANGE’ occur in November as polls indicate, we should see a lot of people from
Illinois moving to Washington, D.C., and taking key spots in an Obama administration. Now is
the time to anticipate these changes."



“We will be in Washington, D.C., August 4, 5, and 6, and we’re interested in scheduling a
meeting with your government affairs team to discuss the changing political landscapes and
our services and capabilities.”



“Dan is mentioned in every book about Sen. Obama and is profiled in Sen. Obama’s book,
‘The Audacity of Hope.’ Dan has been interviewed in recent months by Time magazine, the
Washington Post, ABC’s ‘20/20,’ CNN, the L.A. Times, the Chicago Tribune and many
other publications about Sen. Obama.”



Of course, the Obama campaign professed shock and disappointment at Shomon's solicitation.
“As Mr. Shomon acknowledges, this e-mail was poorly conceived and inappropriate in both
tone or content," Obama's campaign said. "He has also committed, and we fully expect, that his
firm will take the utmost care to avoid in the future actions or any appearances such as that
raised by this e-mail.” Yeah, right. This guy figures with Tony Rezko headed to prison for a
long sentence, the field is wide open for him. Note that Shomon's solicitation describes him
as "Obama’s longest serving campaign adviser and strategist."



Obama, while in Indiana yesterday, took time out for a lofty interview with Jake Query and
Terri Stacy , morning show folks at WIBC. It was in keeping with the dumbing down of America
approach to American politics. The questions were about on this level:



Terri: Do you wear boxers or briefs? HaHaHaHaHeHeHe



Jake: Are you a Mountain Dew Man? Hey, Put It Right There.



Terri: Can I keep one of your used soda cans as a keep-sake?



Jake: Is it true how big it is, you can tell me, good buddy?



Terri: Can I hold it? HeHeHeHe?



Jake: Oh yeah, our boss wanted us to ask you if Evan Bayh is going to be your choice for Vice
President?



Terri: Oh, boo! Jeff Smulyan is a party pooper. He cut our pay! Posted by

Munster Condo Association Sued For Discrimination

The Justice Department is suing the Autum Ridge Condominium Association in Munster because
its Board allegedly denied housing to a black couple with children. The Association had a rule
in place until 2007 which prohibited sales to anyone with children under the age of 18 if the
children were to live in the units. In this case, however, the previous owner of the condo had
children living in her unit with her. The Northwest Indiana Times' Joe Carlson's explains
what led federal authorities to conclude the Association discriminated against the couple:



According to government filings in Hammond federal court, condo association officials did
not raise an issue about Valentine's two children violating board policy until after the
officials learned Valentine and Haddox were black during face-to-face meetings.



Until June 25, 2007, the association had a rule prohibiting sales to anyone with children
younger than 18 if the children were to live in the units. But the previous owner, Diane
Webster- Rangel , had two children living in the condo, federal filings allege.



Haddox and Valentine would have been the first black residents in the 20-unit development at
633 South St. since the association was formed in 1986,

the government lawsuit states.



Department of Justice spokeswoman Jamie Hais said her department's lawsuit is the result of a
complaint received and investigated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development.



Civil Rights Division trial attorney M. Elizabeth Parr states in the federal complaint that
the board's decision not to approve the $122,000 sale between the previous owner and Haddox
violated the Fair Housing Act by discriminating on the basis of race and familial status.



Other victims included the seller, who had to accept a lower purchase price from a white buyer
in 2007, and Haddox's real estate agents, who did not get paid for their work on the deal, the
lawsuit alleges.



Collins points out in his story other housing discrimination lawsuits the federal
government has brought in the region. Last year, the government sued the Town of St. John for
denying a zoning variance to a man who wanted to allow unmarried persons suffering from MS to
live in his home for treatment. The town had an ordinance against unmarried persons living
together in a single residence. In 2002, the government brought a case against Lake County
after a head of the economic development agency was fired because he supported an affordable
housing project in Lake Station which might attract minorities. And who said the Bush Justice
Department doesn't enforce civil rights? Posted by

Six Candidates Vie For 7th District GOP Nomination

It may seem hard to believe, but there are six candidates who will be competing at this Friday's
caucus to replace Jon Elrod on the ballot for 7 th District Congress. According to the Indiana
Daily Insight, they include Gabrielle Campo , Kevin Green, Ray Irvin, Patrick O'Connor,
Michael Simpson, and Jason Turnbill . As an elected precinct committeeperson in the
district, I've heard from only one of the candidates. Patrick O'Connor, a claims adjuster for
Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, who telephoned me this evening. The law firm of Ice Miller,
as represented by Marion Co. GOP Chairman Tom John and 7 th District GOP committeeman John
Hammond, is backing Campo . It's no secret that Ice Miller has strong ties to the Center
Township Democrats (the firm represents Center Township Trustee Carl Drummer) and the
Carson political machine. Ice Miller partner Lacy Johnson is very close to Andre Carson who,
like his grandmother, provides an important link to the firm's D.C. lobbying practice. I'm
not sure what to make of this "party support" for Campo . It's kind of like former Marion Co. GOP
Chairman John Keeler's support for Greg Jordan in the 2003 mayoral race. Keeler's law firm,
Baker & Daniels, had a provision in their legal contract with the City of Indianapolis at the
time which said Keeler couldn't speak out against Mayor Peterson. As you may recall, Jordan
struggled to raise money and lost badly to Peterson. Posted by

Mayor Greg Ballard today announced the appointment of veteran firefighter Brian Sanford as
his choice for Chief of the Indianapolis Fire Department. Sanford formerly served as Deputy
Chief of IFD’s EMS Division, and until IFD’s most recent consolidation with Warren
Township, he served as that township’s Fire Chief. According to a press release from the
Mayor's Office, Sanford "emerged as the top choice through a highly competitive process."

Anatomy Of An Internet Rumor

Last week, a few local Democratic blogs in a southern state began circulating a rumor that a
prominent statewide elected Republican official had been caught in bed having sex with a male
staffer by his wife. The rumor had it that the young up-and-comer, who towed the conservative
line on things like gay marriage, would be announcing his resignation shortly. Word had it
that Sen. John McCain's campaign had acted quickly and removed the next Larry Craig from an
official role in his campaign. The rumor quickly spanned across the Internet, being touted by
the usual liberal suspects as an another example of a hypocritical family values Republican
gone bad. By the time it made it's way to the Daily Kos , it wasn't just a rumor, it was a fact. Some
local Indiana blogs (including those critical of this blog's decision to report Larry
Sinclair's sex and drug allegations against Sen. Barack Obama ) jumped on the bandwagon as
well.



Well, guess what, the resignation of the official never took place. A planned press
conference to address the claim was supposedly called off after the state's leading
newspaper decided there was no story to report. One of the local blogs began back-peddling on
the story. The blog wrote:



A source close to (Blank), in adamantly denying the allegations about (Blank) in rumors that
are circulating, called the rumors “atrocious” and “as bad a smear attempt as (Blank)
faced in 1998.” ((Blank) was a Republican candidate for Lt. Gov. in 1998 when he was
confronted with accusations that he assaulted and raped a prostitute. The accusations where
shown to be false, and (Blank) won the election.) Another local blog, which is no fan of the
high-ranking Republican in question, offered this prescient perspective on the effort to
make the rumor true on Internet blogs:



Over the last few weeks of this rumor being propogated , and the last week of this being all over
the Internet, there hasn ’t been a single shread of corroboration that anything has
happened except that (Blank) and his wife are on the outs.



Guess what guys? That story’s pretty old. Here’s a big secret (Blank) probably doesn ’t
want you to know about. A lot of people that work with and around him don’t like him, and they
talk smack about him to me and others (mostly others, and then it trickles down to me weeks
later). I didn ’t bring up his purported marital problems because it didn ’t even occur to
me to bring it up . . .



And that record is often believed and spread beyond our small group of readers and beyond the
Internet. So it becomes accepted by many that Barack Obama is a Muslim who doesn ’t say the
pledge of allegiance, the September 11 attacks were actually a government conspiracy, and
(Blank) is actually gay . . .



So my conclusion is that (Blank) shouldn ’t resign over this petty crap, and those of us who
are his vocal [and reasonable] opponents shouldn ’t jump on this bandwagon of slander.
(Blank) is unfit for office and has a history of ethical lapses, immature actions,
demagoguery, and politicization of his official duties. Do we really have to stoop low and
become rumor spreaders? Do we need to go so low as to make unfounded accusations about his
sexuality, especially those of us who cite his homophobia as one reason for our opposition?



What happened to this prominent southern politician this past week is simply inexcusable.
The blogs on the Left will do anything to destroy a Republican, no matter how harmful it is to the
wife and family of the politician whom they are targeting, and justify it based on political
ideology. I know nothing about this Republican official. Maybe there is some truth to the
rumors, but it seems to me there should at least be a person with some first-hand knowledge
stepping forward with information before you go and spread it all over the Internet. You can't
google this man's name without reading all kinds of stuff about what a hypocritical , closeted
homosexual he is now. And based on what? As one local blogger said after the fact, "Did any of you
even bother to ask his wife who supposedly kicked him out of the house if it was true?"



We saw this same thing earlier this year when a local Democratic blogger published a false and
defamatory claim that a Republican candidate for Congress was gay and then had the audacity to
claim he considered the Republican candidate a friend and meant no harm by it when called out on
it. The same Democratic blogger did the same but even worse to an openly gay Democratic
candidate for Congress in 2006 so it came as no surprise. Nationally, one blogger has made a
name for himself outing closeted homosexual politicians, as long as they are Republicans. He
has repeatedly published unsubstantiated rumors about a southern Republican governor
being gay. He even named a young male staffer with whom the governor had supposedly had sex,
only to have the male staffer later deny the claim. As I learned a long time ago, with these kinds
of people, their ways are always Machiavellian . The ends always justifies the means. If it can
destroy the person's political career, it's justified whether it's true or not.



Note that I have intentionally chose not to link to any of the blogs in question or identify the
name of the politicians in question to avoid propagating the rumors associated with these
politicians' names. It's easy enough for you to find on your own by doing your own google
search. I'm not going to give them the satisfaction of boosting traffic to their sites, which
is the reward they are seeking for their dirty deeds. Several of the usual suspects attempted
to post comments about the rumor pertaining to this politician on this blog over the last
several days anonymously, of course, as they always do when carrying out their dirty work.
