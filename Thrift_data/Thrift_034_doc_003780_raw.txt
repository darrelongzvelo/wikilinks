Bad Ass Looks Bad Ass



My first reaction to this trailer was to say to myself:

“Who the fuck made a movie about my dad without his consent?”

I’m not even kidding.

My dad might not be Mexican, or look at all like Danny Trejo for that matter, but if you were to
throw a camo jacket on him, and put him on a bus, chances are the events of this trailer would
inevitably play out, in real life; and likely with twice as many fist fights.

Speaking of Danny Trejo,Â I’m happy to see him finally get some leading roles at this late
stage in his career.

Typically a typecast supporting actor, my dad and I used to have a joke about Mr. Trejo, namely
the fact that he seemed to die in every movie we saw him in.

Thankfully, someone else took the time to assemble this, a nearly 4 minute compilation of
every Trejo death in all of cinema:

Any man who’s been killed by Jason Mewes , Bobby D and Mickey Rourke , (twice!) has my respect.

When I was a kid, my friends and I knew him as “That Guy,” but somewhere down the line,
through his many epic onscreen deaths; he earned the greatest honor any bit actor can hope to
achieve:

That of making his name known to the general public.

That being said, while Machete , and now Bad Ass remain his only starring roles, Mr. Trejo has
come a long way from his days of playing “Ruddy Complexioned Mexican #5.”

While Bad Ass does in fact look bad ass, in a less extreme/stylizedÂ  Hobo With a Shotgun sort
of way, the whole “based on a true story” thing has got me a little confused.

I mean, it’s made fairly clear that the concept of the movie is taken from this:

The rest of the movie however, is undoubtedly bullshit.

That’s necessarily a bad thing, I just don’t get why they’d bother to base a movie on a
well-known incident, only to go ahead and fictionalize the rest of the story.

“Inspired by” likely would’ve been the proper turn of phrase.

Also, I hate to say it, ’cause it’s so fuckin’ obvious that it makes me sound like a
simpleton for mentioning it, but both the title and the concept feel a little to close to
Kick-Ass if you ask me.

Then again, I’m not a Hollywood marketing rep that stares at market research data all day, so
maybe those similarities are exactly what is going to make the movie bankable.

Even so, the lack of humor/heart in the trailer lead me to believe even that won’t save it.

That being said, the movie honestly doesn’t look all that worthwhile, outside of the
punching I mean, though I’d be curious to see how my dad would react to it.

My guess is he’d find a tad more relatable than he’d care to admit…

The Top 10 Manliest Man Moments #7: The Poe-Dozer





Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/manly-man-final1.jpg?w=406&h=394

Welcome back folks, to the Azn Badger’s list of theÂ  Top 10 Manliest Man Moments!

So far we’ve covered the head-exploding exploits of Kenshiro from Fist of the North Star ,
the unbridled savagery of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s John Matrix in Commando , and the
sporadic and unfocused heroism of Han Solo.

Indeed, with every entry on this list we’ve explored a number of different forms of
MANLINESS , and today will be no exception.

Today, as we name the 7th MANLIEST MAN moment in movie history, we enter the 7th circle of
MAN-DOM :



Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/poe-zone.jpg?w=406&h=206 Make
no mistake, Con Air is a horribly disjointed mess of a movie.

Despite having an all-star cast, Con Air isn’t action-y enough to be an action movie, nor
prison-y enough to be a prison movie; resulting in a film that has no fuckin’ clue what it
wants to do with itself.

In falling flat on it’s face trying to embody the genres listed above, Con Air falls back on
what many Jerry Bruckheimer financed blockbusters attempt to do, namely be “funny.”

Normally this would be acceptable, (and if Michael Bay’s in charge, very likely racist)
however in this case most of the funny lines are delivered by DEATH ROW INMATES , making the
humor just a little bit morally questionable.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/conair-girl.gif?w=406

Haha! Serial killers are HILARIOUS!

Despite all of Con Air’s failings, to it’s credit; it remains a very watchable piece of
mid-90′s garbage.

One thing the movie did do Â  right though, was give us the awesomeness that is Nic Cage’s
Cameron Poe.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/cameron-poe.jpg?w=406

Cameron Poe, feeeeeeeels so good....

A quiet Southern gentleman who just happens to be an Army Ranger, Cameron Poe also happens to be
mullet-ed and blue jean-ed Â DEATHÂ  on 2 legs.

Case in point, Poe is known to be SO FUCKING SAVAGE Â that in defending his PREGNANT WIFE
against 3 drunken yahoos, 1 of whom is armed with a knife; Poe ends up getting sent to prison for
manslaughter.

Seriously man, the guy is SO FUCKING SAVAGE Â that in killing an armed man in self-defense,
he gets sent to prison for 8 years on the grounds that he “should’ve known better,” being
as he’s a FUCKING KILLING MACHINE .



Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/poe-face.jpg?w=406

Anyway, despite Poe’s infinite awesomeness, Con Air as a movie doesn’t exactly afford
him all that many opportunities to be badass.

There’s that one time he rescues a stuffed bunny through “presenting rearward” to a
more than a little surprisedÂ  Nick Chinlund while over-the-top rock music blared in the
background:

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/poe-bedlam.jpg?w=406

Somebody just lost their cherry. Not sure who...

Then there was that one time he Chuck Norris -ed the shit out of some Mexicans to the sounds of
over-the-top rock music:

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/poe-kick1.jpg?w=406

The MANLIEST of MANLY maneuvers: The Roundhouse Kick!

And I guess there was that one time he prevented the rape of that one lady from Total Recall by
beating the shit out of “The Man Who Always Dies In Movies,” Danny Trejo ; also set to
over-the-top rock music:



Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/con-air-danny-trejo.jpg?w=406 In
other words, Cameron Poe; as awesome as he is, seems dependent on the presence of over-the-top
stylings of Trevor Rabin’s orchestral synth-rock music in order to get his swagger on and
kill the fuck out of, well; apparently mostly just Mexicans.

Cameron Poe’s not racist, there just happen to be a lot of Hispanic bad guys that wander into
his path in Con Air.

At least I hope that’s the case…

Thankfully, Cameron Poe’s MANLIEST of MAN moments, and our 7th MANLIEST MAN moment in all of
movies; involves no violence directed at Hispanics, but rather Â plain ‘ole white guys,
which of course makes it all the more PC!:

So here’s the basic setup:

An impeccably dressed John Cusack and that one Irish guy from Star Trek have finally caught up
to the Jail Bird, the plane carrying all of the escaped convicts AKA the bad guys.

Chasing after the plane in pair of attack helicopters, the Irish guy orders his pilot to shoot
it down; while John Cusack’s Vince Larkin does what he can to protect the government’s
property I.E. both the plane and CAMERON FUCKING POE by screaming “CEASE FIRE!” into the
ear of the pilot in the front seat.

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/john-cusack-con-air.jpg?w=406

Dial it down Cusack! The check cleared...

Long story short, some shots are fired, but not enough to knock the plane out of the sky.

During all of this however, Nic Cage’s Cameron Poe is in the process of HULKING OUT over his
diabetic friend Baby-O, played by Bubba from Forrest Gump ; having just been shot in the gut by
John Malkovich’s unitentionally hilarious Cyrus the Virus.

Nearly brought to MANLY tears at the sight of his friends lying on the ground dieing and rapidly
losing his faith, Poe does what any self-respecting MAN would do and casually DECLARES
HIMSELF Â  GOD and sets out on his way to kill a bunch of people:



Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/baby-o.jpg?w=406 Thus begins
the awesomeness of MANLY moment #7.

Standing up from tending to his fallen friend, The Poe’s trademark over-the-top rock music
starts blaring, and shit gets real, really fuckin’ fast!

Stomping down the aisle of the Jail Bird on a bee line for the cockpit, Poe throws on his MANLIEST
of MAN-FACES and ascends to his ULTIMATE level of MAN-SAVAGERY :



Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/the-poe-dozer.jpg?w=406
Despite the massive aura of MANLINESS radiating from him during all of this, a couple of the bad
guys foolishly step up to challenge The Poe-Dozer .

First up is a big-ass blonde, shirtless douchbag with a broken bottle that uses what little
time he has left on this Earth to shout a retarded and borderline incoherent threat at The
Poe-Dozer :

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/freeze-little-bitch-boy.jpg?w=406

Just 'cause you've only got a tenth second to issue a threat, doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

As one might expect, size advantage or not; going toe-to-toe with The Poe when he’s in
full-on Poe-Dozer Mode get’s this poor shmuck beat to shit something fierce.

Quick as you can say “1, 2, 3″ The Poe-Dozer brings it’s blade to bear and claims it’s
first victim:

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/poe-dozer-beat-down.jpg?w=406

Wham, bam, thank you ma'am...

Not skipping a beat, The Poe-Dozer continues his march of MANLINESS , letting out an obscenely
MANLY “HUUOOOAAAH!!!!!” as he steps over the fallen blonde douchebag.

Unfortunately, another bad guy pops up in The Poe’s way; this time armed with a handgun.

Having seen his partner utterly steamrolled by the fury of The Poe-Dozer , the baddie wastes no
time lifting his pistol and opening fire.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/poe-dozer-shot.jpg?w=406

Bad Guy used Bullet Seed! It's not very effective...

Unbeknownst to this particular bad guy though, The Poe-Dozer is immune to gunfire, thusly
causing the otherwise debilitating injury of a bullet to the bicep Â to seem like little
more than a minor annoyance.

… A minor annoyance that serves to ANGER the already POSITIVELY Â  FUMING Poe-Dozer.

That being said, it should come as no surprise, least of all to the bad guy standing before him;
that The Poe-Dozer Â goes to town on this sad sack of fuck with a motherfuckin’ vengeance.

… But not before we cut to a shot of the guy having a moment as he reflects on the error of his
ways:



Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/poe-epiphany.jpg?w=406

Utterly frozen in disbelief at the sight of The Poe-Dozer’s unflinching reactionÂ to
the gunshot wound, the convict finds himself unable to pull the trigger a second time.

His fate sealed, the bad guy quickly succumbs to the unrelenting fury of The Poe-Dozer ;
falling by the wayside after 3 consecutive straight right hands to the jaw.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/3.jpg?w=406

... And here comes #3.

At this point the music has already begun to calm down, thereby stripping The Poe-Dozer of his
inhuman strength and vengeance fueledÂ  MAN-RAGE .

Fortunately, the previous 2 bad guys made up the bulk of The Poe’s resistance in reaching the
cockpit, with the last obstacle remaining in his way (besides the fucking door) being the
effeminate cross-dressing convict, “Sally Can’t Dance.”

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/conair-fag.gif?w=406

Behold, the dreaded final boss of the "March to the Cockpit" stage in Con Air: The Videogame!

Reverting from his uber-violent Poe-Dozer Mode to the more socially acceptable Southern
Gentleman Mode , The Poe sees fit to dispatch “Sally Can’t Dance” in a manner that is
fitting, namely that of laying the smack down with an open palm:



Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/5-fingers-say-to-the-face.jpg?w=406

Huh, ‘guess I lied about the “no violence towards Hispanics” in this scene.

Oh well.

Technically there’s more to it, but in my eyes this moment marks the conclusion of the 7th
MANLIEST MAN moment in movies.

Check back tomorrow for MANLY moment #6 on our list of the Top 10 Manliest Man Moments!

Playstation Move + Sports ChampionsÂ Review





Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/the-playstation-move.jpg?w=406&h=214

Today I spent a good portion of my afternoon kickin’ it with my Korean buddy from up the
street.

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/n10720770_39112504_6462.jpg?w=406

Pictured: Said Korean. He made this, not me.

Being as he’s a gadget oriented person, he saw fit to purchase the new Playstation Move on the
first day of it’s release.

I was fortunate to be invited to christen the mighty motion control device along with him.

Color me surprised when I discovered that it was actually kind of fun to play.

Bear in mind, my impressions are, of course; derived solely from the Sports Champions disc
packed with it.

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/sports-champions-move-logo.jpg?w=406

Azn chick with a bow. Now that's not cliched imagery...

Like most gaming peripheral pack-in games I.E. Wii Sports , Super Scope 6 , etc., Sports
Champions could be viewed as little more than a tech-demo for the device, however in the case of
the Move, it just happens to be a surprisingly deep and full-featured tech-demo.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/super_scope.jpg?w=406&h=265

FUCK. YES.

The game contains 6 different styles of play:

Archery, Ping Pong, Volleyball, Bocce Ball, Disc Golf, and a sword and shield Gladiator Duel.

I leave it to you to guess which game I insisted on playing most often.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/gladiator-2.jpg?w=406

"ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!?"

While I didn’t have the opportunity (nor desire) to try the Volleyball game, I was pretty
impressed with most of the others.

The Archery was pretty straightforward, and definitely favored speed over accuracy.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/robin.jpg?w=406&h=270

Much like how I favor this Robin Hood over any other.

I have to say, requiring the player to actually have to reach over their shoulder to pull the
next arrow from their quiver was a nice touch.

Other than that though, the Archery game was definitely lacking without the use of a second
Move controller to properly simulate the tensile strength on the string of the bow.

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/playstation-move-article-archery-254x298.jpg?w=406

The second controller tracks the distance between the 2 to determine the strength of the shot.
SCIENCE.

My friend is a gadget guy, but he’s also Azn, so I don’t expect he’ll be shelling out the
cash for another controller any time soon.

Moving on, Ping Pong was definitely a standout among most of the games.

Ping Pong was the first game I was privy to trying my hand at, and as such, it served as my
introduction to the technical capabilities of the Move.



Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/playstation-move2.jpg?w=406

TECHNICAL.

My first action in the game was to turn over my wrist before the serve, just to see how well the
Move could track my motions.

I have to say, it was quite satisfying to see my on-screen avatar (some douche in sunglasses
named Dallas) actually match my wrist gesticulations move for move.

Here’s a video of someone (who sucks) playing the same character:

Once I started the game, I found the controls to be quite intuitive and surprisingly true to
life.

I was perhaps most impressed by the controller’s ability to keep up with my movements
despite my wonky style of playing Ping Pong.

I play right-handed, but in a Southpaw stance… And I also play back-handed with the racquet
held at my waist.

Image:

Pictured: The Azn Badger playin' Ping Pong.

Goofy yes, but effective against lower-tier players like myself.

Despite all that goofiness, the Move managed to keep up just fine, allowing me to actually get a
win in Ping Pong before my friend, the owner of the device, even got a chance to.

Bocce Ball was kind of a mixed bag.

I played it hot-seat style with my 2 other friends, and we found that:

A): Bocce Ball is a game that is probably more fun when someone in the room knows the
rules/objective of the game.

And B): Bocce Ball is a game best played in the presence of old people or feebs.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/bocceball6.jpg?w=406&h=448

Pictured: The correct people to stomp on in Bocce Ball.

While pretty fun, especially whenever someone managed to accidentally make a nice shot, the
real problem with Bocce Ball was the Move’s inability to simulate the weight of a Bocce Ball
in your hand.

Trust me, when you’re trying to determine just how much man-force behind your Bocce throw,
more often than not you’ll find yourself overthrowing.

This same problem was present when playing Disc Golf with the same 2 friends.



Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/disc_golf_pole_hole_basket_icon_dark_t_shirt-p2350855121044466533ryr_400.jpg?w=406

Thankfully, no one I know owns one of these.

Although in this case, the problem was much more pronounced.

Disc Golf was kind of like the Wii Bowling of the Sports Champion disc.

Once you “get it,” that is, figure out how to position your wrist and how much man-force to
put behind your shots, for the most part you’ve pretty much figured out the game.

Though my friends and I didn’t come close to mastering Disc Golf in the short time we played
it, I can say this:

Those of us who could straighten their wrists properly (not me) were consistently the victor
in every match we played.

That being said, let’s cut through the bullshit and get down to talkin’ about the only game
in Sports Champions that really matters:

GLADIATOR DUEL



I’ve played Gladiator Duel for about 4-5 hours total now, and I’ve gotta’ say, at least
against the computer; it’s pretty fuckin’ fun.

The basic gameplay of Duel is that of a motion controlled sword fight.

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/ps_move_sports_champions_gladiator.jpg?w=406&h=304

Yes, you do in fact look THIS dorky when playing.

Remember how utterly weak-sauce the controls of Wii Boxing were?

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/wii-boxing.jpg?w=406&h=222

You know how he landed that shot? By flailing around for 5 minutes and getting lucky, that's
how.

Well, Gladiator Duel blows that shit outta’ the water.

Remember how every swing you performed in Wii Tennis, regardless of power or direction, would
always result in a canned animation?

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/spielberg_shiggy_wiitennis.jpg?w=406&h=300

Pictured: Steven Spielberg spite-killing Shigeru Miyamoto at Wii Tennis.

Well, Gladiator Duel spreads it’s cheeks and drops a log all over that shit’s face.

Remember how Rocky successfully ended the reign of the communist reign of the USSR using only
his fists and the magnificent man-force of his man-fists ?

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/rocky4pruitt.jpg?w=406

BOW BEFORE YOUR GOD.

Well, that has nothing to do with Gladiator Duel, but it was fuckin’ awesome…

Anyway, when playing Duel, swinging the Move controller results in any number of attacks,
while doing the same motions while holding the trigger on the controller results in
manipulation of the player’s shield.

Parries, that is defense using one’s sword are possible and indeed recommended, as are the
use of lateral movement and backsteps.

There are numerous context sensitive actions available in the game, so many in fact that I
found myself wondering how fun Gladiator Duel would be to play online with human players.

Here’s a clip, I don’t feel like fishing for pics right now:

Trust me when I say this, the game is far more intense once you step up the difficulty level.

I was quite impressed by the sheer volume of content available in Sports Champions, well, at
least the Gladiator Duel portion of it.

Near as I can tell, there are 10 racially diverse player avatars to choose from, with
apparently an additional six unlockable after completing all of the challenges for each
sports event.

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/sports-champions-20100831015813073-000.jpg?w=406&h=228

Pictured: The 2 Azn characters. Both are Japanese. Go figure.

My buddy and I managed to unlock Titus, the Roman gladiator-garbed boss character of the
Gladiator Duel game.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/images2.jpg?w=406

Pictured: Titus and his trident wielding friend.

In addition to this, different weapon skins and costumes are unlockable for each character,
but perhaps most importantly, many characters possess their own movement animations, with
only a few being reused here and there.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/paletteswapping.jpg?w=406

Thankfully there wasn't a whole lot of this in Sports Champions...

Little details like that were certainly not necessary for the developers to release Sports
Champions successfully, however they are ultimately what kept me from holding all that much
against it.

I can honestly say that I’ll probably never invest in a Move, (I’d need a Playstation 3
first now, wouldn’t I?) however that doesn’t stop me from having a lot of fun playing it at a
friend’s house.

A few words to potential purchasers:

My buddy was telling me that he tried using the Move in conjunction with the game Tiger Woods 11 ,
only to find that the motion controls were stunningly inaccurate.

Also, the same buddy is still trying to find a game that stands out as being a must purchase for
the Move.

To top things off, as mentioned earlier, many games seem to need a second controller to work
properly, so that’s an extra $40 if you seriously wanna’ get the most out of your
experience.

Oh well, that doesn’t stop me from pestering my buddy to buy another controller so we can try
The Fight: Lights Out …

A Tribute to the “That Guy’s” of Action Cinema





Image:

I’d like to take a moment to honor Danny Trejo in recognition of his remarkable achievement
of going from being little more than a “That Guy” in action movies throughout the 90′s,
to landing his first legitimate starring role in Robert Rodriguez’s Machete .

In my early childhood I knew him as “that ruddy-complexioned guy that dies all the time.”

Danny Trejo on the set of Anaconda upon being handed his paycheck.

Later on I knew him as a much friendlier personality in the form of the voices of Enrique on King
of the Hill ,

He's so friendly!

and well; himself, in the videogame Def Jam: Fight for New York .

Well, it’s about 20 years overdue, but finally the day has come that we can all say we know
Danny Trejo as the star of his own movie.

Anyway, in honor of Danny Trejo and the host of other perpetually typecast actors, I’d like
to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the “That Guy’s” of action cinema.

What is a “That Guy,” you ask?

According to Google Images, THIS is a "That Guy." I vehemently disagree.

A “That Guy” is one of those actors that is consistently typecast in various bit-roles,
typically along the lines of “ugly thug #1″ or “dude that gets shot.”

It goes without saying, that the vast majority of “That Guy’s” end up playing villains
throughout the entirety of their careers.

Think of it this way:

If you’ve seen an action movie actor enough times that you know their face, but not their
name; chances are they’re a “That Guy.”

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/noel-gugliemi1.jpg?w=406

Take Noel Gugliemi for instance. You probably saw him in S.W.A.T., Training Day, or The Fast
and the Furious, but you probably didn't know his name.

Over the years there have been a handful of “That Guy’s” that have ascended to
legitimate celebrity, though every case is essentially a million to one shot.

For the most part though, a “That Guy’s” claim to fame generally springs from the list of
big name action stars that have killed them throughout their career.

Take Sven-Ole Thorsen for example:

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/abraxas5.jpg?w=406

The funniest pic I could find.

A veteran of an ungodly number of action films, the big Dane got capped to shit by Leonardo
DiCaprio in The Quick and the Dead ,



he got offed by Steven Seagal in On Deadly Ground , he got the everloving-shit kicked out of him
by Russell Crowe in Gladiator ,

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/8-most-violent-best-picture-winners-05.jpg?w=406&h=270

Yup, that's him on the left.

and to top it all off, he’s been torn apart by Arnold Schwarzenegger more times than I care to
count.

Best of all though, not only has ‘ole Sven been killed by Ah-Nold more times than I’ve used
the word “fuck” on this blog, he’s also accomplished the astounding feat of being
killed by Arnold twice in the same movie franchise .

Said franchise would of course be the Conan series .



Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/conan.jpg?w=406&h=258

Sven was in both films, playing 2 different characters, though in Conan the Destroyer he was
fitted with a dorky looking helmet, most likely to hide his appearance.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/conan353.jpg?w=406

Not this dorky, but close enough.

No article about “That Guy’s” can be made without mention of the uber-prolific Thomas
Rosales Jr.

You may of course remember him as the deaf as fuck Hispanic mercenary, Carter, from The Lost
World .

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/24954-22252.gif?w=406

You're gonna' get Spielberg Spite Killed so bad...

Well, beyond that, chances are you also remember him from Raw Deal , The Running Man , Last
Action Hero , (Arnold killed him a few times) and the sci-fi sequels, Robocop 2 and Predator 2 .

Any man that takes a bullet from Robocop , and gets skinned by the Predator , definitely
deserves special mention.

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/irvin-guesswhothomasrosalesjrrobocop2.jpg?w=406

Robocop likes to be thorough. Shooting people 3 times is standard practice.

Another example of the quintissential “That Guy” I’d like to point out is the classic
“Azn That Guy,” Al Leong .

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/182-5002.gif?w=406

As seen in Die Hard.

If ever there was a need for an Asian “That Guy,” in any action movie ever , chances are Al
Leong was considered for the part.

With his distinctive beard and outrageous bald spot, Mr. Leong made in appearances in such
classics as Bill and Ted’s Excellent adventure (as Genghis Khan no less) and Big Trouble in
Little China , as well as achieved the honor of being killed off by industry greats like Mel
Gibson ( Lethal Weapon ),



Tee hee, that was silly.

and Bruce Willis ( Die Hard ).

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/leong.jpg?w=406

Mr. Leong about a half second before Mr. Willis put half a clip through him.

Though in my eyes he’s nowhere near as accomplished as either of the other 2 men above,
Patrick Kilpatrick is a “That Guy” that deserves mention, if not for his
awesomely-badassÂ  name, then for the sheer strength of his performances.



Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/patrick-kilpatrick-dgg-015348.jpg?w=406

Whenever I look at him, words like "rapist" and "pedophile" spring to mind.

Few “That Guy’s” can match Kilpatrick’s ability to stand out from the crowd with his
creepy mannerisms and borderline down-syndrome kid facial structure.

That being said, Mr. Kilpatrick’s been killed by Steven Seagal in Under Siege 2: Dark
Territory , Bruce Willis in Last Man Standing , Arnold Schwarzenneger in Eraser , and he even
got to be the primary antagonist in the Jean-Claude Van Damme prison actioner, Death Warrant .



Not only that, he got to fight Treat Williams in The Substitute 4: Failure Is Not An Option .

What?

I happen to like Treat Williams…

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/treat-williams-3-sized.jpg?w=406

How could you not like him!?

Anyway, I don’t want to overstay my welcome with this tribute post, so I’ll just finish by
rattling off a few more “That Guy’s” that deserve to be known somewhere on the internet.

Nick Chinlund AKA Billy Bedlam from Con Air , thanks for having the raunchiest, slimiest voice
of any “That Guy” EVER .

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/3115.gif?w=406

Should've put the Bunny back in the box...

Robert Z’Dar , thanks for having the biggest fucking chin on the face of the planet.Â  Oh
yeah, thanks for making Tango and Cash suck just a little bit less too.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/18909-18946.jpg?w=406

Just so you know, he's not wearing any makeup or prosthetics. Seriously.

Tommy Lister , thanks for being the president of THE WORLD in The Fifth Element , and giving us
Deebo in Friday , and Zeus in No Holds Barred .Â  Foh’ real man, I don’t think anyone else
could’ve done so much with so little.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/ls1.jpg?w=406

THAT, my friends, is a unibrow.

Michael Berryman , sorry about theÂ  Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia , but think of it
this way, you saved many a filmmaker a shit ton of money on makeup effects.

Image: http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/berrymanlisker.jpg?w=406

That's him on the left, stupid.

and Brian Thompson , thanks for reminding me of Michael Berryman when you’re head’s
shaved, and for the Buffalo Bob sequence in Joe Dirt .



Brian Thompson in drag = Funny.Â  Spade without Farley = Sad.

Anyway, there’s a shit ton of other “That Guy’s” deserving of recognition, and
perhaps we’ll get to them another day, but for now, here’s to hoping they all know
they’re appreciated.

Remember, just ’cause I don’t know your name doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate what you
do.

Predators Sucked a Honey Badgerâ€™sÂ Ass



Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/predator_-_concrete_jungle_20051.jpg?w=406&h=432

And sucked it good...

Nimrod Antal’s Predators sucked donkey balls.

Like, FOH’ REAL .

Image:
http://aznbadger.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/1796935253_05ddd19656.jpg?w=406

Hah! Betcha' didn't think I could tie in the Hawaiian stuff with donkey balls, am I right?

Nothing happened in the first half of the movie.

My favorite actor in the movie was killed off way too early, and unceremoniously at that.

Adrien Brody spends the whole movie failing at imitating Christian Bale’s Batman voice.

Topher Grace is mostly useless, essentially still stuck playing Eric Forman (don’t ask me
why Eric Forman has a Wikipedia article) from That 70′s Show .

So much of the film was made in homage to the first film in the series that it may as well have been a
remake.

The Predators have virtually no presence in the film, physical or otherwise.



Oh yeah, and the last third of the movie, which is also curiously overlong; takes what little
promise the film might have had, and proceeds to shit all over it.

With poop.

For 45 minutes.

Boy am I glad my brother paid for my ticket this time…
