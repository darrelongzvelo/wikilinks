the Maidenhair Tree , is a unique species of tree with no close living relatives. The Ginkgo is a
living fossil , as a unique species recognisably similar to fossils dating back 270 million
years. Native to China, [ 3 ] the tree is widely cultivated and introduced early in human
history, and has various uses as a food and in traditional medicine.

[ edit ] Description



Ginkgos are large trees, normally reaching a height of 20â€“35 m
(66â€“115 feet), with some specimens in China being over 50 m (164 feet). The tree
has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep rooted and
resistant to wind and snow damage. Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely
branched; the crown becomes broader as the tree ages. During autumn, the leaves turn a bright
yellow, then fall, sometimes within a short space of time (1â€“15 days). A
combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant wood and the ability to form aerial
roots and sprouts makes ginkgos long-lived, with some specimens claimed to be more than
2,500 years old.

Ginkgo is a relatively shade-intolerant species that (at least in cultivation) grows best in
environments that are well-watered and well-drained. The species shows a preference for
disturbed sites; in the "semi-wild" stands at Tian Mu Shan, many specimens are found along
stream banks, rocky slopes, and cliff edges. Accordingly, Ginkgo retains a prodigious
capacity for vegetative growth. It is capable of sprouting from embedded buds near the base of
the trunk (lignotubers, or basal chi chi) in response to disturbances, such as soil erosion.
Old individuals are also capable of producing aerial roots (chi chi) on the undersides of
large branches in response to disturbances such as crown damage; these roots can lead to
successful clonal reproduction upon contacting the soil. These strategies are evidently
important in the persistence of Ginkgo; in a survey of the "semi-wild" stands remaining in
Tian Mu Shan, 40% of the Ginkgo specimens surveyed were multi-stemmed, and few saplings were
present. [ 4 ]

[ edit ] Stem



Ginkgo branches grow in length by growth of shoots with regularly spaced leaves, as seen on
most trees. From the axils of these leaves, "spur shoots" (also known as short shoots) develop
on second-year growth. Short shoots have very short internodes (so they may grow only one or
two centimeters in several years) and their leaves are usually unlobed. They are short and
knobby, and are arranged regularly on the branches except on first-year growth. Because of
the short internodes, leaves appear to be clustered at the tips of short shoots, and
reproductive structures are formed only on them (see pictures below - seeds and leaves are
visible on short shoots). In Ginkgos, as in other plants that possess them, short shoots allow
the formation of new leaves in the older parts of the crown. After a number of years, a short
shoot may change into a long (ordinary) shoot, or vice versa.

Ginkgo leaves in autumn

The leaves are unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins radiating out into the
leaf blade, sometimes bifurcating (splitting) but never anastomosing to form a network. [ 5 ]
Two veins enter the leaf blade at the base and fork repeatedly in two; this is known as
dichotomous venation. The leaves are usually 5â€“10 cm (2-4 inches), but
sometimes up to 15 cm (6 inches) long. The old popular name "Maidenhair tree" is because
the leaves resemble some of the pinnae of the maidenhair fern, Adiantum capillus-veneris .

Leaves of long shoots are usually notched or lobed, but only from the outer surface, between
the veins. They are borne both on the more rapidly-growing branch tips, where they are
alternate and spaced out, and also on the short, stubby spur shoots, where they are clustered
at the tips.

[ edit ] Reproduction



Ginkgos are dioecious , with separate sexes, some trees being female and others being male .
Male plants produce small pollen cones with sporophylls each bearing two microsporangia
spirally arranged around a central axis.

Female plants do not produce cones. Two ovules are formed at the end of a stalk, and after
pollination , one or both develop into seeds. The seed is 1.5â€“2 cm long. Its fleshy
outer layer (the sarcotesta ) is light yellow-brown, soft, and fruit -like. It is attractive
in appearance, but contains butyric acid [ 6 ] (also known as butanoic acid) and smells like
rancid butter or vomit [ 7 ] when fallen. Beneath the sarcotesta is the hard sclerotesta (the
"shell" of the seed) and a papery endotesta , with the nucellus surrounding the female
gametophyte at the center. [ 8 ]

Ovules

    The fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs via motile sperm, as in cycads, ferns, mosses
    and algae. The sperm are large (about 70â€“90 micrometres) [ 9 ] and are similar to
    the sperm of cycads, which are slightly larger. Ginkgo sperm were first discovered by the
    Japanese botanist Sakugoro Hirase in 1896. [ 10 ] The sperm have a complex multi-layered
    structure, which is a continuous belt of basal bodies that form the base of several
    thousand flagella which actually have a cilia-like motion. The flagella/cilia
    apparatus pulls the body of the sperm forwards. The sperm have only a tiny distance to
    travel to the archegonia, of which there are usually two or three. Two sperm are produced,
    one of which successfully fertilizes the ovule. Although it is widely held that
    fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs just before or after they fall in early autumn, [ 5 ] [
    8 ] embryos ordinarily occur in seeds just before and after they drop from the tree. [ 11 ]

[ edit ] Distribution and habitat



Although Ginkgo biloba and other species of the genus were once widespread throughout the
world, their range shrank until by two million years ago it was restricted to a small area of
China . For centuries it was thought to be extinct in the wild, but is now known to grow in at least
two small areas in Zhejiang province in Eastern China, in the Tian Mu Shan Reserve. However,
recent studies indicate high genetic uniformity among ginkgo trees from these areas,
arguing against a natural origin of these populations and suggesting that the ginkgo trees in
these areas may have been planted and preserved by Chinese monks over a period of about 1,000
years. [ 12 ] Whether native ginkgo populations still exist has not been demonstrated
unequivocally.

Where it occurs in the wild it is found infrequently in deciduous forests and valleys on acidic
loess (i.e. fine, silty soil) with good drainage. The soil it inhabits is typically in the pH
range of 5 to 5.5. [ 13 ]

In many areas of China it has been long cultivated and it is common in the southern third of the
country. [ 13 ] It has also been commonly cultivated in North America for over 200 years, but
during that time it has never become significantly naturalised. [ 14 ]

[ edit ] Taxonomy and naming



The species was initially described by Linnaeus in 1771, the specific epithet biloba derived
from the Latin bis 'two' and loba 'lobed', referring to the shape of the leaves. [ 15 ] Two names
for the species recognise the botanist Richard Salisbury , a placement by Nelson as
Pterophyllus salisburiensis and the earlier Salisburia adiantifolia proposed by James
Edward Smith . The epithet of the latter may have been intended to denote a characteristic
resembling Adiantum , the genus of maidenhair ferns. [ 16 ]

The relationship of Ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain. It has been placed
loosely in the divisions Spermatophyta and Pinophyta , but no consensus has been reached.
Since Ginkgo seeds are not protected by an ovary wall, it can morphologically be considered a
gymnosperm . The apricot-like structures produced by female ginkgo trees are technically
not fruits , but are seeds that have a shell that consists of a soft and fleshy section (the
sarcotesta ), and a hard section (the sclerotesta ).

The ginkgo is classified in its own division , the Ginkgophyta, comprising the single class
Ginkgoopsida, order Ginkgoales, family Ginkgoaceae , genus Ginkgo and is the only extant
species within this group. It is one of the best-known examples of a living fossil , because
Ginkgoales other than G. biloba are not known from the fossil record after the Pliocene . [ 17 ] [
18 ]

[ edit ] Etymology



The older Chinese name for this plant is éŠ€æžœ, meaning "silver fruit", nowadays
pronounced as yÃ­nguÇ’ in Mandarin. The most usual names today are ç™œæžœ
(bÃ¡i guÇ’) , meaning "white fruit", and éŠ€æ�� (yÃ­nxÃ¬ng) , meaning
"silver apricot ". The former name was borrowed directly in Vietnamese as báº¡ch quáº£
. The latter name was borrowed in Japanese ã�Žã‚“ã�ªã‚“ (ginnan) and
Korean ì�€í–‰ (eunhaeng) , when the tree itself was introduced from China.

The scientific name Ginkgo appears to be due to a process akin to folk etymology . Chinese
characters typically have multiple pronunciations in Japanese, and the characters
éŠ€æ�� used for ginnan can also be pronounced ginkyÅ� . Engelbert Kaempfer , the
first Westerner to see the species in 1690, wrote down this pronunciation in his Amoenitates
Exoticae (1712) with the "awkward" spelling "Ginkgo". This appears to be a simple error of
Kaempfer, taking his spelling of other Japanese words into account, a more precise
romanization would have been "Ginkio" or "Ginkjo". [ 19 ]

The Ginkgo is a living fossil , with fossils recognisably related to modern Ginkgo from the
Permian , dating back 270 million years. The most plausible ancestral group for the order
Ginkgoales is the Pteridospermatophyta, also known as the " seed ferns ," specifically the
order Peltaspermales . The closest living relatives of the clade are the cycads , [ 20 ] which
share with the extant G. biloba the characteristic of motile sperm. Fossils attributable to
the genus Ginkgo first appeared in the Early Jurassic , and the genus diversified and spread
throughout Laurasia during the middle Jurassic and Early Cretaceous . It declined in
diversity as the Cretaceous progressed, and by the Paleocene , Ginkgo adiantoides was the
only Ginkgo species left in the Northern Hemisphere while a markedly different (and poorly
documented) form persisted in the Southern Hemisphere . At the end of the Pliocene , Ginkgo
fossils disappeared from the fossil record everywhere except in a small area of central China
where the modern species survived. It is doubtful whether the Northern Hemisphere fossil
species of Ginkgo can be reliably distinguished. Given the slow pace of evolution and
morphological similarity between members of the genus, there may have been only one or two
species existing in the Northern Hemisphere through the entirety of the Cenozoic :
present-day G. biloba (including G. adiantoides ) and G. gardneri from the Paleocene of
Scotland . [ 21 ]

At least morphologically, G. gardneri and the Southern Hemisphere species are the only known
post-Jurassic taxa that can be unequivocally recognised. The remainder may have been
ecotypes or subspecies . The implications would be that G. biloba had occurred over an
extremely wide range, had remarkable genetic flexibility and, though evolving
genetically, never showed much speciation . While it may seem improbable that a species may
exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the Ginkgo's life-history
parameters fit. These are: extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and
later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution coupled
with, as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record, extreme ecological conservatism
(restriction to disturbed streamside environments). [ 22 ]

Modern-day G. biloba grows best in environments that are well-watered and drained, [ 23 ] and
the extremely similar fossil Ginkgo favored similar environments: the sediment record at
the majority of fossil Ginkgo localities indicates it grew primarily in disturbed
environments along streams and levees. [ 22 ] Ginkgo therefore presents an "ecological
paradox" because while it possesses some favorable traits for living in disturbed
environments (clonal reproduction) many of its other life-history traits (slow growth,
large seed size, late reproductive maturity) are the opposite of those exhibited by modern
plants that thrive in disturbed settings. [ 24 ]

Given the slow rate of evolution of the genus, it is possible that Ginkgo represents a pre-
angiosperm strategy for survival in disturbed streamside environments. Ginkgo evolved in
an era before flowering plants, when ferns , cycads , and cycadeoids dominated disturbed
streamside environments, forming a low, open, shrubby canopy. Ginkgo' s large seeds and
habit of "bolting" - growing to a height of 10 m before elongating its side branches - may be
adaptions to such an environment. The fact that diversity in the genus Ginkgo drops through
the Cretaceous (along with that of ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids) at the same time that
flowering plants were on the rise, supports the notion that flowering plants with better
adaptations to disturbance displaced Ginkgo and its associates over time. [ 25 ]

    Ginkgo has been used for classifying plants with leaves that have more than four veins per
    segment, while Baiera for those with fewer than four veins per segment. Sphenobaiera has
    been used to classify plants with a broadly wedge-shaped leaf that lacks a distinct leaf
    stem. Trichopitys is distinguished by having multiple-forked leaves with cylindrical
    (not flattened) thread-like ultimate divisions; it is one of the earliest fossils
    ascribed to the Ginkgophyta.

Symbol of Tokyo prefecture, representing a ginkgo leaf.

Ginkgo has long been cultivated in China ; some planted trees at temples are believed to be over
1,500 years old. The first record of Europeans encountering it is in 1690 in Japanese temple
gardens, where the tree was seen by the German botanist Engelbert Kaempfer . Because of its
status in Buddhism and Confucianism , the Ginkgo is also widely planted in Korea and parts of
Japan ; in both areas, some naturalization has occurred, with Ginkgos seeding into natural
forests.

In some areas, most intentionally planted Ginkgos are male cultivars grafted onto plants
propagated from seed, because the male trees will not produce the malodorous seeds. The
popular cultivar 'Autumn Gold' is a clone of a male plant.

Ginkgos adapt well to the urban environment, tolerating pollution and confined soil spaces.
[ 27 ] They rarely suffer disease problems, even in urban conditions, and are attacked by few
insects. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] For this reason, and for their general beauty, ginkgos are excellent urban
and shade trees, and are widely planted along many streets.

Ginkgos are also popular subjects for growing as penjing and bonsai ; they can be kept
artificially small and tended over centuries. Furthermore, the trees are easy to propagate
from seed.

Extreme examples of the Ginkgo's tenacity may be seen in Hiroshima , Japan , where six trees
growing between 1â€“2 km from the 1945 atom bomb explosion were among the few living
things in the area to survive the blast ( photos and details ). While almost all other plants
(and animals) in the area were destroyed, the ginkgos, though charred, survived and were soon
healthy again. The trees are alive to this day.

The ginkgo leaf is the symbol of the Urasenke school of Japanese tea ceremony . The tree is the
national tree of China . The tree is the official tree of the Japanese capital of Tokyo , and the
symbol of Tokyo is a ginkgo leaf.

Ginkgo seeds served with boiled coconut flesh as a dessert in Thailand.

The nut-like gametophytes inside the seeds are particularly esteemed in Asia, and are a
traditional Chinese food. Ginkgo nuts are used in congee , and are often served at special
occasions such as weddings and the Chinese New Year (as part of the vegetarian dish called
Buddha's delight ). In Chinese culture, they are believed to have health benefits; some also
consider them to have aphrodisiac qualities. Japanese cooks add Ginkgo seeds (called ginnan
) to dishes such as chawanmushi , and cooked seeds are often eaten along with other dishes.

When eaten in large quantities or over a long period, especially by children [ 30 ] the
gametophyte (meat) of the seed can cause poisoning by MPN ( 4'-O-methylpyridoxine ). MPN is
heat stable and not destroyed by cooking. [ 30 ] Studies have demonstrated that convulsions
caused by MPN can be prevented or terminated with pyridoxine .

Some people are sensitive to the chemicals in the sarcotesta, the outer fleshy coating. These
people should handle the seeds with care when preparing the seeds for consumption, wearing
disposable gloves. The symptoms are allergic contact dermatitis [ 31 ] [ 32 ] or blisters
similar to that caused by contact with poison ivy . However, seeds with the fleshy coating
removed are mostly [ clarification needed ] [ quantify ] safe to handle.

[ edit ] Medicinal uses



Extracts of Ginkgo leaves contain flavonoid glycosides and terpenoids ( ginkgolides ,
bilobalides ) and have been used pharmaceutically. These extracts are shown to exhibit
reversible, non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibition , as well as inhibition of reuptake
at the serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine transporters, with all but the
norepinephrine reuptake inhibition fading in chronic exposure. [ 33 ] Ginkgo supplements
are usually taken in the range of 40â€“200 mg per day. Recently, a meta-analysis of
clinical trials have shown Ginkgo to be moderately effective in improving cognition in
dementia patients [ 34 ] but not preventing the onset of Alzheimer's Disease in normal people.
[ 35 ] [ 36 ]

[ edit ] In memory enhancement



Ginkgo is believed to have nootropic properties, and is mainly used as memory [ 37 ] and
concentration enhancer, and anti- vertigo agent. However, studies differ about its
efficacy. The largest and longest independent clinical trial conducted by the Journal of the
American Medical Association (JAMA) to assess Ginkgo biloba published the finding in 2008
that the supplement does not reduce incidence of all-cause dementia or Alzheimer disease in
adults 75 years or older who had normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment when given a
twice-daily dose of 120 mg extract of G. biloba . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] However, a similar trial published
in 2010 by the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry concluded that the same extract
formulation of G. biloba (EGb 761), when given as a single 240 mg daily dose, "was found
significantly superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with dementia with
neuropsychiatric symptoms." [ 40 ]

According to some studies, Ginkgo can significantly improve attention in healthy
individuals. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In one such study, the effect was almost immediate and reaches its peak
in 2.5 hours after the intake. [ 43 ]

One study suggests that Ginkgo's effect on cognition may be attributable to its inhibitory
effect on norepinephrine reuptake . [ 33 ]

Nonetheless, a meta-analysis in 2012 published in Human Psychopharmacology (Clinical and
Experimental) by Laws, Sweetnam and Kondel [ 44 ] reported zero effect sizes for the impact of
Ginkgo Biloba on memory, attention and problem solving

[ edit ] In dementia



Ginkgo has been proposed as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease on the basis of positive
preclinical results in mice [ 45 ] and a 2006 study that found 160 mg of ginkgo extract as
effective as a daily 5 mg dose of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil in human subjects.
[ 46 ] A 2008 randomized controlled clinical trial published in the International Journal of
Geriatric Psychiatry found ginkgo ineffective at treating dementia in humans at a daily dose
of 120 mg. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] A similar trial published in the same journal in 2010, however, found
ginkgo effective at treating mild to moderate dementia at the higher single dose of 240 mg
daily. [ 40 ] Another randomized controlled trial, published in JAMA in 2009, found no benefit
from ginkgo in preventing cognitive decline or dementia when given at a dose of 120 mg twice
daily. [ 36 ] A similar study reported in 2012 concluded that long-term use of ginkgo biloba
extract does not affect progression to Alzheimer's disease. [ 49 ] A recent meta-analysis of
nine studies of ginkgo for use in the treatment of dementia concluded that it was more
effective than placebo although, like other dementia drugs, the clinical significance of
these moderate effects was difficult to quantify. [ 34 ] An editorial in The Lancet concluded
that there is substantial evidence that ginkgo biloba does not prevent dementia in elderly
individuals with or without memory complaints or cognitive impairment and is not effective
for prevention of Alzheimer's disease. [ 50 ]

[ edit ] In other symptoms



Out of the many conflicting research results, Ginkgo extract may have three effects on the
human body: improvement in blood flow (including microcirculation in small capillaries) to
most tissues and organs; protection against oxidative cell damage from free radicals ; and
blockage of many of the effects of platelet-activating factor (platelet aggregation, blood
clotting) [ 51 ] that have been related to the development of a number of cardiovascular,
renal, respiratory and central nervous system disorders. Ginkgolides , especially
ginkgolide B, are potent antagonists against platelet-activating factor ; and thus may be
useful in protection and prevention of thrombus , endotoxic shock , and from myocardial
ischeamia . [ 52 ] Ginkgo can be used for intermittent claudication .

Ginkgo has been studied as a potential treatment for sexual dysfunction related to SSRI use,
but failed to show any effectiveness in placebo-controlled trials. [ 53 ] [ 54 ]

The World Health Organization [ 55 ] reports that the medicinal uses of Ginkgo biloba that are
supported by clinical data include treatment of the effects mild to moderate
cerebrovascular insufficiency [ 56 ] as well as the effects of peripheral arterial occlusive
diseases. [ 57 ] Cerebrovascular insufficiency, i.e., insufficient blood flow to the brain,
may manifest itself as such memory deficit, disturbed concentration or headaches.
Peripheral arterial occlusive diseases are those in which the blood flow to the smaller
arteries are restricted and may include claudication, i.e., painful walking, and Raynaud's
disease , a condition in which the extremities such as fingers, toes, nose or ears, feel numb
and cold.

Preliminary studies suggested that Ginkgo might be of benefit in multiple sclerosis, but
clinical trials failed to show any effect on cognitive function in MS patients. [ 58 ]

[ edit ] Supplement Quality and Concerns



The most clinically tested form of gingko is Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) as opposed to whole
leaf powder. GBE contains two major groups of phytochemicals, or marker compounds: flavonol
glycosides and terpene lactones. Extracts shown to work in clinical trials contain at least
22 percent glycosides and 5 percent terpene lactones. [ 59 ]

Ginkgo biloba is thought to have been one of the most adulterated herbal supplements, meaning
ginkgo products were frequently contaminated with other, less expensive substances that
contain these marker compounds. [ 60 ] For example, some manufacturers have used a small
amount of ginkgo extract and added flavonol glycosides from less expensive buckwheat. [ 59 ]

Independent testing of ginkgo supplements has shown a number of products to lack expected
levels of flavonol glycosides and terpene lactones. [ 61 ] In 2003, tests conducted by
ConsumerLab.com found seven of nine popular ginkgo supplements did not contain expected
levels of marker compounds. [ 62 ] In 2006, six of thirteen products failed testing for the same
reason (two of which also contained high levels of lead per daily serving- 12 and 16 mcg,
respectively). [ 63 ] Five out of eight popular supplements tested also failed
ConsumerLab.com testing in 2008, one of which was contaminated with lead. [ 64 ]

Tests in 2012, however, suggested that the quality of ginkgo supplements may be improving.
Out of four popular ginkgo supplements selected for testing by ConsumerLab.com, three
contained adequate marker compound levels and none failed for unacceptable levels of lead. [
59 ]





[ edit ] Side effects



Ginkgo may have undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation
disorders and those taking anticoagulants such as aspirin or warfarin , although recent
studies have found that ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or
pharmacodynamics of warfarin in healthy subjects. [ 65 ] Ginkgo inhibits monoamine oxidase,
[ 66 ] and, therefore, people who are taking certain types of antidepressants (such as
monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ), as well as
pregnant women may experience side effects. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]

Additional side effects include increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort,
nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , headaches, dizziness, heart palpitations , and restlessness.
[ 68 ] [ 69 ]

[ edit ] Allergic precautions and contraindications to use



People taking pharmaceutical blood thinners such as warfarin or coumadin should consult
with their doctor before taking Ginkgo biloba extracts, as it acts as an anti-coagulant .

The presence of amentoflavone in Ginkgo biloba leaves would indicate a potential for
interactions with many medications through the strong inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 ;
however, there is a lack of any empirical evidence supporting this. Further, at recommended
doses, studies have shown "Multiple-dose administration of Ginkgo biloba did not affect
cytochrome P-450 2D6 or 3A4 activity in normal volunteers." [ 70 ] It is possible that the
concentration of amentoflavone found even in commercial Ginkgo biloba extracts is too low to
be pharmacologically active.

Ginkgo biloba in Morlanwelz-Mariemont Park, Belgium

Ginkgo biloba leaves and sarcotesta also contain ginkgolic acids , [ 71 ] which are highly
allergenic , long-chain alkylphenols such as bilobol [ 72 ] (a substance related to anacardic
acid from cashew nut shells and urushiols present in poison ivy and other Toxicodendron spp.)
[ 32 ] Individuals with a history of strong allergic reactions to poison ivy, mangoes, cashews
and other alkylphenol-producing plants are more likely to experience an adverse reaction
when consuming Ginkgo-containing pills, combinations, or extracts. The level of these
allergens in standardized pharmaceutical preparations from Ginkgo biloba was restricted
to 5 ppm by the Commission E of the former Federal German Health Authority.
