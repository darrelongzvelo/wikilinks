An interesting Ocean dream!



Jul 29

Posted by advicebyalex

Hey Everyone,

Hope you are all doing well, and yes I know can you believe it 2 posts in one day omg it’s like a
miracle lol. Â I know can you believe I am writing twice in one day; well neither can I.
Â Anyway with this dream I don’t really remember that much just that it all took place by an
Ocean. Â I first remember being in the ocean with my cousins, and that’s when it hit me I
have been to this place once before, many times perhaps that I now recall and we were swimming
and it was nice. Â Then I remember being with my dad and him and I were swimming a far distance
in the bottom of the ocean and instead of having a swim suite gear on with oxygen tank and
everything we had this nifty device that let us breath underwater for a long period of time.
Â I don’t know where we were swimming, but it was like I knew exactly where I was like I had
been there before. Â The last thing I remember was that we somehow arrived from the ocean to
home and the last thing i remember was that the device broke and my dad was saying to me that why
did you break it, I was going to sell this, which was impossible because it was already used.
Â When I was going to reply with some snotty retort I woke up completely confused by this
remark. Â I thought both of these dreams combined were interesting because they mainly
centered around my dad and me. Â I have yet to figure the meaning of this out. Â So until we
connect again guys have yourselves an absolutely wonderful day, and I will be talking to you
all very soon!

With Love and Blessings,

Alex

Dream about a Restaurant



Jul 29

Posted by advicebyalex

Well Hello Everyone,

Welcome So I decided to write about this dream I had last night; well at least one of them anyways
it was quite an interesting experience. Â So in the dream I was with my family somewhere I
Â guess at some restaurant that we went to all the time, and it was none that I new in real life,
mostly because I didn’t recognize it. In the dream I guess we were all unhappy about the food.
Â So I remember that my mom and sister left somewhere who knows where, and it was just me and my
dad and we had got the manager of the store to come out and talk with us. Â I was using a
different side of me that normally doesn’t come out, because I was complaining to the
restaurant manager about what we didn’t like so we Â could get our meals for free. Â In
the course of this dream it ended I don’t know where because I woke up in the middle of it, and
thought mmm that was weird and fell back asleep. Â So who knows why i had this dream I have know
idea. Â So until we connect again guys have a fabulous day, and I will talk to you all really
soon.

With Love and Blessings,

Alex

Sex,College Parties, and Rock and Roll!



Jul 27

Posted by advicebyalex

Well Hello and Welcome Everyone,

Well hello everyone; I hope that everyone is doing good on This fine friday of July 27th, 2012.
Â I know I am it’s the start of a New Weekend here and I am looking forward to it. Â I have a
lot planned to get done, cleaning the apartment, writing a few chapters in my book oh yeah you
heard that writing it’s on the list, oh and most importantly sleep. Â Also I forgot to
mention that I am planning on working on a new website, and I can already hear the what I like this
one so much; why change it? Â Well don’t you worry this website is neither changing, nor
going anywhere. Â I am creating a new website for my other Radio show Talk Psych with Alex and
Karolina my Psychology Show here on Blogtalkradio, with my lovely host Karolina Kristof.
Â So that is what is on the agenda for me to do this weekend, let’s see how much of it I really
get done. Â Also I will be keen pretty much all weekend so if you wanna get a reading on there it
will be fabulous; as this will not keep me from being bored when I am on there since I do need some
travel money for next weekend. Â My advisor screen name on their is advicebyalex23 or just
go to www.keen.com/advicebyalex23 to find out more on getting a reading from me there.
Â Anyway So you are probably wondering the title of this blog is interesting, and your
probably thinking what is this about? Â Am I correct, I thought so. Â Well let me tell you a
little bit about how this sex dream went down, or as my mentor likes to call it OBE sex dream
experiences. Â Anyway I was actually in the state between concsiousness, and
unconcsiousness of sleep so halfway between dreaming, and sleeping so it could almost relate
to what is known as a daydream. Anyway I was in my dorm room, in my room and I seem to have a couple of
people over, and it seemed to be a party going on I knew everybody there; even though in real life
I have know idea who they are. Â So we seem to have been doing true or dare, and I guess it was
someone’s turn to suck this one guy off; who by this point was already naked; and by the way
really hot just saying wouldn’t mind doing this in real life lol if you know what I mean.
Â Anyway I was like okay I am just going to go for so that’s when I went down and starting
sucking this guys dick. Â So basically I went down on him, in the simplest of terms. Â Then
before we could finish at all, that’s when I woke up and became mad; because I never got to
finish the sex dream; when I have been asking my guides for weeks to have a sex dream. Â The sad
thing is though I never got to see the guys face in my dream, which saddens me cause I would have
really liked to. This seems to be a trend in my sex dreams lately I never get to see the persons
face; so unfair, which leaves me to guess and ponder who the person really is. Â Well since
this is the end of the dream, I think it is well I off I stop here and get going since I am going to
take a nap because I have pulled a all night-er so I think I deserve one. Â So until we connect
again guys, have yourself and absolutely fabulous day and weekend, and I will be talking with
everyone soon!

With Love and Blessings,

Alex

The Boys are coming in, in full strength !



Jul 23

Posted by advicebyalex

Well Hello and Welcome Everyone,

Hope everyone is enjoying there day I decided to blog again I Â know two in one day; can you
believe it? Â I certainly cannot believe it. Â It’s been a fun day so far, nothing
really exciting happening yet; but I am sure it will. Â So for those of you that have heard I
have applied, and interviewed for an RA position here on campus and I am still waiting for the
answer I know it will come eventually it just the waiting process that is pure torture.
Â This was exactly the same way I was when I applied, and worked interviewed for Disney
World. Â The waiting process was pure torture I think I had to wait for like a month or so;
before I found anything out. Â It was a crazy process for those of you that have ever applied
for the Disney World Internship Program it’s awesome! Â So anyways once I find out about
the RA position, and wether or not that I have got it. Â I will let you know hopefully I will
know by Wednesday because I would like it to happen before then. Â Anyways enough rambling
about me let’s get on to the topic that I really wanted to talk about. Â The boys as you all
very much know by now, I have a lot of boys in my inner circle; which I love because I love helping
them out and guiding them along the path when they need help. Â So let’s just say it’s not
Sean or Sam coming in very strong although they pop in and out when they please; which I don’t
mind I think Sam is not that strong right now because we are going to be together again in the Fall
Semester so I will be seeing him, and I am sure that if I wasn’t then it would be a lot stronger;
but I do wish I could have another sex dream with him soon! Â Come on Universe let’s make
that happen because Alex here would love for that to happen; since he needs a really good sex
dream soon. Â Anyways the Boys that are coming in our John, and a new one that I haven’t
talked about before; but I am now is Joe. Â So let me tell you a little bit about Joe before I
move on it wasn’t until I saw him kinda in person that I realized there was a past life
connection, but I wasn’t sure what we were until I talked to of course Allie; and she said that
we have been very good friends for many lifetimes. This of course makes sense because, when I
saw him in person and he looked into my eyes I felt a sudden warm of deep friendship and
connection that I have only felt with certain people along the way. Â For the record I
haven’t met him on a personal level yet, but we were in the same room. Â We will be meeting
though in this lifetime I do not know when I am excited for that time though, and I wonder if we
will continue to be good friends. Â I know we were just supposed to meet and say hi and stuff
life that; but you all know that free will can change all that and we could be really good friends
(who knows). Â Anyway lately he has been around full strong and so I have had to look up stuff
on him. Â Anyways lately when I have been looking at him and observing his personality
it’s pretty scary how similar our personalities are like almost identical. Â I
haven’t really observed our traits or anything like that mostly personality; this is
Karolina’s job this week is to see what kind of traits our similar that we have I mean we do look
similar both blue eyes dark hair so that’s a couple. Â Anyways when I was watching and
observing I got this strangest feeling that in the past we have been more then just friends, but
I didn’t know what it was until I asked Karolina. Â She said she feels we could have been
brothers, and I would have to agree on that. Â This his because this energy is different then
John’s energy. Â This because I feel so much love and compassion, and deep rooted
unconditional love the kind that you have for family, and then there is the longing sensation
of when he is around, and I miss him. Â This is different then John’s energy because I feel a
sense of friendship as well with him; but I can also feel the energy that only lovers can have and
it is nice, but when I dream about him or daydream about him I only think about friendship and
being best friends; which I think will happen and it would be nice because I have never had a good
guy best friend before and that would be nice to have just someone to share things with of the
same-sex would be nice. Â I love having female best friends to don’t get me wrong it’s
just there is something about having a best friend of the same sex that it feels good and someone
to confide in with as well. Â So yeah these two have been around strong for the past couple of
weeks and I love it and am embracing; it can be tiring yes but I love it. Â It’s really
awesome, and I am sure I will be having more dreams with John that I am sure I will be writing about
on here as well. Â I have never had a dream about Joe before, I really wish I could but
haven’t; which lord knows I would like to have I have only had really good daydreams about
Joe, which for me is just the same as dreaming about him since dreaming and day dreaming are
practically the same thing just dreaming happens when you are asleep, and daydreaming
happens when you are awake.

Okay so I think I have bored you all to death of what as been going on in my life around me. Â So I
think I am going to go and I will talk with everyone later. Â So until we connect again guys
have yourselves and absolutely wonderful evening and I am oiing to be talking with you all
soon. Â Since I am doing the podcast today yeah I am so excited to do the podcast for today it
will be a lot of fun, I just gotta figure out what I am exactly going to be talking about today
since I have no idea yet I will figure it out though.

With Love and Blessings,

Alex

John, and Me oh yeah love it!



Jul 23

Posted by advicebyalex

Hello Everyone and Welcome,

Hope everyone is doing good on this fine Monday Morning here, and I hope you all stay cool on this
Monday since it’s going to be hot one today! Â Hope everyone’s weekend was good I know
mine was.

Okay So I had another dream about John over this weekend, and it was really cool experience
because I have never actually had this kind of experience happen to me before. Â First
though can I just say how much I love this man, and how glad I am to be connected with him this is a
very special connection for me and I love it. Â Anyway I was on the way back to school; and my
dad was driving and all of a sudden I felt really tired so I felt like I should take a nap on the way
to school. Â So I did and as I did This I ended up daydreaming about John, while falling asleep
and it was really vivid daydream about the future. Â Then when I actually fell asleep, which
didn’t seem that long I was dreaming about him. Â It didn’t hit me later in the evening
when I got back to school that what it was that I was dreaming about with him. Â Also usually
when I dream about something and it’s foggy it normally pops up later in the day when I least
expect it and I am like oh yeah that is it. Â So anyway what I remember from the dream was that I
was with John and I was in this great big room full of people looking around and it seemed to be
some sort of event going on. Â It wasn’t until later after I heard of the event that was
going in the course that I had dreamt about John that I realized OMG I dreamt about an actual
event happening on the exact same day that it was happening in real time. Â I thought this was
so cool because I have never ever experienced it before. Â I wonder why I was allowed to
experience this event as well? Â Was he thinking of me without even realizing it; because
sometimes that does happen? Â I do not know all that Â I know is what I saw and experienced.
Â Then later when I went to bed that night I fell asleep, and when I woke up for work I realized
that again I had another dream with John. Â I don’t really remember this one maybe it will
hit me later today when I least expect hit of what it is then I will blog about it who knows, I have
know idea. Â I am realizing more and more that my dreams; with this man are getting stronger
and stronger. Â I do not know why, but I like it and I have a theory of why it could but I am not
sure about it. I feel like since it’s getting closer and closer to our time that we meet that
it’s getting stronger and the bond is getting stronger in our dreams who knows. Â Well I
believe that is all for know guys don’t won’t to bore you all with more details; so until we
connect again guys have yourselves an absolutely fabulous day and I will be talking to you
soon.

With Love and Blessings,

Alex

Another Dream About Josh yah I am liking it!



Jul 19

Posted by advicebyalex

Hey Everyone and Welcome,

So okay sorry it’s been so long since I have posted a blog I know I have just been super busy with
things this past week and interview stuff so it has gone by quickly. Â I have updates for
everyone so let’s get this show on the road!

Okay So last week I had another dream about Josh I am liking it So this time I dreamt that we were on
vacation in Europe I didn’t know where, and then other people from high school popped up it
was interesting. Â So i already what this dream was about since I already talked to Allie.
Â So interestingly enough me and Josh in a past life together around the 1100′s were in the
Knights templer in the Italy, and France part of Europe so it was interesting to find out!
Â So It was interesting finding out about this past life! Â So to find out more
information about this group I will put it below enjoy reading it; it is good. Â Have a great
day everyone!

TheÂ  Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon Â ( Latin :Â 
Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Solomonici ), commonly known as theÂ  Knights
Templar , theÂ  Order of the Temple Â ( French :Â  Ordre du Temple Â orÂ  Templiers
) or simply asÂ  Templars , were among the most famous of theÂ  Western Christian Â 
military orders . [4] Â The organization existed for nearly two centuries during theÂ 
Middle Ages .

Officially endorsed by theÂ  Catholic Church Â around 1129, the Order became a favored
charity throughout Christendom, and grew rapidly in membership and power. Templar knights,
in their distinctive whiteÂ  mantles Â with a redÂ  cross , were among the most skilled
fighting units of theÂ  Crusades . [5] Â Non-combatant members of the Order managed a
large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom , innovating financial techniques
that were an early form ofÂ  banking , [6] [7] Â and buildingÂ  fortifications
Â across Europe and theÂ  Holy Land .

The Templars’ existence was tied closely to the Crusades; when the Holy Land was lost,
support for the Order faded. Rumors about the Templars’ secret initiation ceremony
created mistrust, and King Philip IV of France , deeply in debt to the Order, took advantage of
the situation. In 1307, many of the Order’s members in France were arrested, tortured into
givingÂ  false confessions , and thenÂ  burned at the stake . [8] Â Under pressure from
King Philip,Â  Pope Clement V disbanded the Order in 1312. The abrupt disappearance of a
major part of the European infrastructure gave rise to speculation and legends, which have
kept the “Templar” name alive into the modern day.

The first headquarters of the Knights Templar, on theÂ  Temple Mount Â in Jerusalem. The
Crusaders called it theÂ  Temple of Solomon Â and it was from this location that the
Knights took their name of Templar.

After theÂ  First Crusade Â recapturedÂ  Jerusalem Â in 1099, manyÂ  Christian
Â pilgrims travelled to visit what they referred to as theÂ  Holy Places . However,
though the city of Jerusalem was under relatively secure control, the rest ofÂ  Outremer
Â was not. Bandits abounded, and pilgrims were routinely slaughtered, sometimes by the
hundreds, as they attempted to make the journey from the coastline atÂ  Jaffa into the Holy
Land. [9]

Around 1119, the French knightÂ  Hugues de Payens Â approached KingÂ  Baldwin II of
Jerusalem Â with the proposal of creating aÂ  monastic Â order for the protection of
these pilgrims. King Baldwin agreed to the request, and granted space for a headquarters in a
wing of the royal palace on theÂ  Temple Mount , in the capturedÂ  Al-Aqsa Mosque . The
Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what was believed to be the ruins of theÂ 
Temple of Solomon . [5] [10] Â The Crusaders therefore referred to the Al Aqsa Mosque as
Solomon’s Temple, and it was from this location that the new Order took the name ofÂ  Poor
Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon , or “Templar” knights. The Order, with about
nine knights includingÂ  Godfrey de Saint-Omer Â andÂ  AndrÃ© de Montbard , had few
financial resources and relied on donations to survive. Their emblem was of two knights
riding on a single horse, emphasizing the Order’s poverty. [11]

A Templar Knight is truly a fearless knight, and secure on every side, for his soul is protected
by the armour of faith, just as his body is protected by the armour of steel. He is thus doubly
armed, and need fear neither demons nor men.” Bernard de Clairvaux, c. 1135,

De Laude Novae Militaeâ€”In Praise of the New Knighthood [12]

The Templars’ impoverished status did not last long. They had a powerful advocate in
SaintÂ  Bernard of Clairvaux , a leading Church figure and a nephew of AndrÃ© de Montbard,
one of the founding knights. Bernard spoke and wrote persuasively on their behalf, and in 1129
at theÂ  Council of Troyes Â the Order was officially endorsed by the Church. With this
formal blessing, the Templars became a favored charity throughoutÂ  Christendom ,
receiving money, land, businesses, and noble-born sons from families who were eager to help
with the fight in theÂ  Holy Land . Another major benefit came in 1139, whenÂ  Pope
Innocent II ‘s papal bull Â  Omne Datum Optimum Â exempted the Order from obedience to
local laws. This ruling meant that the Templars could pass freely through all borders, were
not required to pay any taxes, and were exempt from all authority except that of the pope. [13]

With its clear mission and ample resources, the Order grew rapidly. Templars were often the
advance force in key battles of the Crusades, as the heavily armoured knights on theirÂ 
warhorses Â would set out to charge Â at the enemy, in an attempt to break opposition
lines. One of their most famous victories was in 1177 during theÂ  Battle of Montgisard ,
where some 500 Templar knights helped several thousand infantry to defeatÂ  Saladin ‘s
army of more than 26,000 soldiers. [14]

Although the primary mission of the Order was military, relatively few members were
combatants. The others acted in support positions to assist the knights and to manage the
financial infrastructure. The Templar Order, though its members were sworn to individual
poverty, was given control of wealth beyond direct donations. A nobleman who was interested
in participating in the Crusades might place all his assets under Templar management while he
was away. Accumulating wealth in this manner throughout Christendom and the Outremer, the
Order in 1150 began generatingÂ  letters of credit Â for pilgrims journeying to the Holy
Land: pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking,
received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon
arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds. This innovative arrangement was an early
form ofÂ  banking , and may have been the first formal system to support the use ofÂ 
cheques ; it improved the safety of pilgrims by making them less attractive targets for
thieves, and also contributed to the Templar coffers. [5] [15]

Based on this mix of donations and business dealing, the Templars established financial
networks across the whole of Christendom. They acquired large tracts of land, both in Europe
and the Middle East; they bought and managed farms and vineyards; they built churches and
castles; they were involved in manufacturing, import and export; they had their own fleet of
ships; and at one point they even owned the entire island ofÂ  Cyprus . The Order of the
Knights Templar arguably qualifies as the world’s firstÂ  multinational corporation .

Battle of the Horns of Hattin Â in 1187, the turning point in the Crusades

[ edit ]Decline



In the mid-12th century, the tide began to turn in the Crusades. TheÂ  Muslim Â world had
become more united under effective leaders such asÂ  Saladin , and dissension arose among
Christian factions in and concerning the Holy Land. The Knights Templar were occasionally at
odds with the two other ChristianÂ  military orders , theÂ  Knights Hospitaller and
theÂ  Teutonic Knights , and decades of internecine feuds weakened Christian positions,
politically and militarily. After the Templars were involved in several unsuccessful
campaigns, including the pivotalÂ  Battle of the Horns of Hattin ,Â  Jerusalem was
captured byÂ  Saladin ‘s forces in 1187. The Crusaders retook the city in 1229, without
Templar aid, but held it only briefly. In 1244, theÂ  Khwarezmi Turks Â recaptured
Jerusalem, and the city did not return to Western control until 1917 when theÂ  British
captured it from theÂ  Ottoman Turks . [18]

The Templars were forced to relocate their headquarters to other cities in the north, such as
the seaport ofÂ  Acre , which they held for the next century. But they lost that, too, in 1291,
followed by their last mainland strongholds,Â  Tortosa Â (in what is nowÂ  Syria ),
and Atlit . Their headquarters then moved toÂ  Limassol Â on the island of Cyprus, [19]
Â and they also attempted to maintain a garrison on tinyÂ  Arwad Island , just off the
coast from Tortosa. In 1300, there was some attempt to engage in coordinated military efforts
with the Mongols [20] Â via a new invasion force atÂ  Arwad . In 1302 or 1303, however, the
Templars lost the island to the EgyptianÂ  Mamluks Â in theÂ  Siege of Arwad . With the
island gone, the Crusaders lost their last foothold in the Holy Land. [14] [21]

With the Order’s military mission now less important, support for the organization began
to dwindle. The situation was complex though, as over the two hundred years of their
existence, the Templars had become a part of daily life throughout Christendom. [22] Â The
organization’s Templar Houses, hundreds of which were dotted throughout Europe and
theÂ  Near East , gave them a widespread presence at the local level. [3] Â The Templars
still managed many businesses, and many Europeans had daily contact with the Templar
network, such as by working at a Templar farm or vineyard, or using the Order as a bank in which to
store personal valuables. The Order was still not subject to local government, making it
everywhere a “state within a state”â€”itsÂ  standing army , though it no longer
had a well-defined mission, could pass freely through all borders. This situation
heightened tensions with some European nobility, especially as the Templars were
indicating an interest in founding their ownÂ  monastic state , just as theÂ  Teutonic
Knights had done inÂ  Prussia [15] Â and theÂ  Knights Hospitaller Â were doing
withÂ  Rhodes . [23]

[ edit ]Arrests, charges, and dissolution

KingÂ  Philip IV of France (1268â€“1314)

In 1305, the newÂ  Pope Clement V , based in France, sent letters to both the Templar Grand
MasterÂ  Jacques de Molay Â and the Hospitaller Grand MasterÂ  Fulk de Villaret
Â to discuss the possibility of merging the two Orders. Neither was amenable to the idea,
but Pope Clement persisted, and in 1306 he invited both Grand Masters to France to discuss the
matter. De Molay arrived first in early 1307, but de Villaret was delayed for several months.
While waiting, De Molay and Clement discussed charges that had been made two years prior by an
ousted Templar. It was generally agreed that the charges were false, but Clement sent
KingÂ  Philip IV of France Â a written request for assistance in the investigation. King
Philip was already deeply in debt to the Templars from hisÂ  war with the English Â and
decided to seize upon the rumors for his own purposes. He began pressuring the Church to take
action against the Order, as a way of freeing himself from his debts. [24]

On Friday, October 13, 1307 (a date sometimes spuriously linked with the origin of theÂ 
Friday the 13th superstition) [25] [26] Â Philip ordered de Molay and scores of other
French Templars to be simultaneously arrested. The arrest warrant started with the
phraseÂ : “Dieu n’est pas content, nous avons des ennemis de la foi dans le Royaume”
["God is not pleased. We have enemies of the faith in the kingdom"]. [27] Â The Templars were
charged with numerous offences (includingÂ  apostasy ,Â  idolatry ,Â  heresy ,
obscene rituals and homosexuality, financial corruption and fraud, and secrecy). [28]
Â Many of the accused confessed to these charges under torture, and these confessions,
even though obtainedÂ  under duress , caused a scandal in Paris. All interrogations were
recorded on a thirty metre long parchment, kept at the “Archives nationales” in Paris.
The prisoners were coerced to confess that they had spat on the CrossÂ : “Moi Raymond de La
FÃšre, 21 ans, reconnais que (J’ai) crachÃ© trois fois sur la Croix, mais de bouche et
pas de coeur” (free translationÂ : “I, Raymond de La FÃšre, 21 years old, admit that I
have spat three times on the Cross, but only from my mouth and not from my heart”). The
Templars were accused of idolatry. [29]

After more bullying from Philip, Pope Clement then issued the papal bullÂ  Pastoralis
Praeeminentiae Â on November 22, 1307, which instructed all Christian monarchs in Europe
to arrest all Templars and seize their assets. [30]

Templars beingÂ  burned at the stake .

Pope Clement called for papal hearings to determine the Templars’ guilt or innocence, and
once freed of theÂ  Inquisitors ‘ torture, many Templars recanted their confessions.
Some had sufficient legal experience to defend themselves in the trials , but in 1310 Philip
blocked this attempt, using the previously forced confessions to have dozens of Templars
burned at the stake in Paris. [31] [32]

Convent of Christ in Castle Tomar , Portugal. Built in 1160 as a stronghold for the Knights
Templar, it became the headquarters of the renamedÂ  Order of Christ . In 1983, it was named a
UNESCO Â  World Heritage Site . [33]

With Philip threatening military action unless the pope complied with his wishes, Pope
Clement finally agreed to disband the Order, citing the public scandal that had been
generated by the confessions. At theÂ  Council of Vienne Â in 1312, he issued a series of
papal bulls, includingÂ  Vox in excelso , which officially dissolved the Order, andÂ  Ad
providam , which turned over most Templar assets to the Hospitallers. [34]

As for the leaders of the Order, the elderly Grand MasterÂ  Jacques de Molay , who had
confessed under torture, retracted his statement. His associateÂ  Geoffroi de Charney ,
Preceptor ofÂ  Normandy , followed de Molay’s example and insisted on his innocence.
Both men were declared guilty of being relapsed heretics, and they were sentenced to burn
alive at the stake in Paris on March 18, 1314. De Molay reportedly remained defiant to the end,
asking to be tied in such a way that he could face theÂ  Notre Dame Cathedral Â and hold his
hands together in prayer. [35] Â According to legend, he called out from the flames that
both Pope Clement and King Philip would soon meet him before God . His actual words were
recorded on the parchment as followsÂ : “Dieu sait qui a tort et a pÃ«chÃ©. Il va
bientot arriver malheur Ã  ceux qui nous ont condamnÃ©s Ã  mort” (free
translationÂ : “God knows who is wrong and has sinned. Soon a calamity will occur to those
who have condemned us to death”). [27] Â Pope Clement died only a month later, and King
Philip died in a hunting accident before the end of the year. [36] [37] [38]

With the last of the Order’s leaders gone, the remaining Templars around Europe were either
arrested and tried under the Papal investigation (with virtually none convicted), absorbed
into other military orders such as theÂ  Knights Hospitaller , or pensioned and allowed to
live out their days peacefully. By papal decree, the property of the Templars was transferred
to theÂ  Order of Hospitallers , which also absorbed many of the Templars’ members. In
effect, the dissolution of the Templars could be seen as the merger of the two rival orders.
[39] Â Some may have fled to other territories outside Papal control, such asÂ 
excommunicated Â Scotland or toÂ  Switzerland . Templar organizations in Portugal
simply changed their name, from Knights Templar toÂ  Knights of Christ Â â€“
seeÂ  Order of Christ (Portugal) . [40]

[ edit ]Chinon Parchment

Main article:Â  Chinon Parchment

In September 2001, a document known as the “ Chinon Parchment ” dated 17â€“20 August
1308 was discovered in the Vatican Secret Archives Â byÂ  Barbara Frale , apparently
after having been filed in the wrong place in 1628. It is a record of the trial of the Templars and
shows that Clement absolved the Templars of all heresies in 1308 before formally disbanding
the Order in 1312, [41] Â as did another Chinon Parchment dated 20 August 1308 addressed
toÂ  Philip IV of France , also mentioning that all Templars that had confessed to heresy
were “restored to the Sacraments and to the unity of the Church”. This other Chinon
Parchment has been well known to historiansÂ  [42] [43] [44] Â having been published
byÂ  Ã‰tienne Baluze Â in 1693, [45] Â and byÂ  Pierre Dupuy Â in 1751. [46]

The current position of theÂ  Roman Catholic Church Â is that the medieval persecution
of the Knights Templar was unjust, that nothing was inherently wrong with the Order or its
Rule, and that Pope Clement was pressed into his actions by the magnitude of the publicÂ 
scandal Â and by the dominating influence of King Philip IV. [47] [48]

[ edit ]Organization

Templar chapel from the 12th C. inÂ  Metz , France. Once part of the Templar commandery
ofÂ  Metz , the oldest Templar institution of theÂ  Holy Roman Empire .

The Templars were organized as aÂ  monastic order Â similar to Bernard’sÂ 
Cistercian Â Order, which was considered the first effective international
organization in Europe. [49] Â The organizational structure had a strong chain of
authority. Each country with a major Templar presence (France,Â  England ,Â  Aragon
,Â  Portugal ,Â  Poitou ,Â  Apulia , Jerusalem,Â  Tripoli , Antioch ,Â  Anjou ,
Hungary, and Croatia) [50] Â had a Master of the Order for the Templars in that region. All of
them were subject to theÂ  Grand Master , appointed for life, who oversaw both the Order’s
military efforts in the East and their financial holdings in the West.

No precise numbers exist, but it is estimated that at the Order’s peak there were between
15,000 and 20,000 Templars, of whom about a tenth were actual knights. [2] [3]

[ edit ]Ranks within the order



[ edit ]Three main ranks



There was a threefold division of the ranks of the Templars: the aristocratic knights, the
lower-born sergeants, and the clergy. Knights were required to be ofÂ  knightly descent
Â and to wear white mantles. They were equipped as heavyÂ  cavalry , with three or four
horses and one or two squires. Squires were generally not members of the Order but were instead
outsiders who were hired for a set period of time. Beneath the knights in the Order and drawn
from lowerÂ  social strata Â were the sergeants. [51] Â They were either equipped
asÂ  light cavalry Â with a single horse [52] Â or served in other ways such as
administering the property of the Order or performing menial tasks and trades.Â 
Chaplains , constituting a third Templar class, wereÂ  ordained Â priests who saw to the
Templars’ spiritual needs. [53]

[ edit ]Grand Masters

Templar building at Saint Martin des Champs, France

Starting with founderÂ  Hugues de Payens Â in 1118â€“1119, the Order’s highest
office was that of Grand Master, a position which was held for life, though considering the
martial nature of the Order, this could mean a very short tenure. All but two of the Grand
Masters died in office, and several died during military campaigns. For example, during
theÂ  Siege of Ascalon Â in 1153, Grand Master Bernard de Tremelay Â led a group of 40
Templars through a breach in the city walls. When the rest of the Crusader army did not follow,
the Templars, including their Grand Master, were surrounded and beheaded. [54] Â Grand
Master GÃ©rard de Ridefort Â was beheaded by Saladin in 1189 at theÂ  Siege of Acre .

The Grand Master oversaw all of the operations of the Order, including both the military
operations Â in the Holy Land andÂ  Eastern Europe Â and the Templars’ financial
and business dealings inÂ  Western Europe . Some Grand Masters also served as battlefield
commanders, though this was not always wise: several blunders in de Ridefort’s combat
leadership contributed to the devastating defeat at theÂ  Battle of Hattin . The last Grand
Master wasÂ  Jacques de Molay , burned at the stake in Paris in 1314 by order of King Philip IV.
[32]

[ edit ]Behaviour and dress



It was Bernard de Clairvaux and founder Hugues de Payens who devised the specific code of
behaviour for the Templar Order, known to modern historians as theÂ  Latin Rule . Its 72
clauses defined the ideal behaviour for the Knights, such as the types of garments they were to
wear and how many horses they could have. Knights were to take their meals in silence, eat meat
no more than three times per week, and not have physical contact of any kind with women, even
members of their own family. A Master of the Order was assigned “4 horses, and one
chaplain-brother and one clerk with three horses, and one sergeant brother with two horses,
and one gentleman valet to carry his shield and lance, with one horse.” [55] Â As the Order
grew, more guidelines were added, and the original list of 72 clauses was expanded to several
hundred in its final form. [56] [57]

http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.20wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png

One of the many reported flags of the Knights Templar

The knights wore a whiteÂ  surcoat Â with a red cross and a white mantle; the sergeants
wore a black tunic with a red cross on front and back and a black or brown mantle. [58] [59]
Â The white mantle was assigned to the Templars at theÂ  Council of Troyes in 1129, and the
cross was most probably added to theirÂ  robes Â at the launch of the Second Crusade
Â in 1147, whenÂ  Pope Eugenius III , KingÂ  Louis VII of France , and many other
notables attended a meeting of the French Templars at their headquarters near Paris. [60]
[61] [62] Â According to theirÂ  Rule , the knights were to wear the white mantle at all
times, even being forbidden to eat or drink unless they were wearing it. [63]

The red cross that the Templars wore on their robes was a symbol ofÂ  martyrdom , and to die in
combat was considered a great honor that assured a place in heaven. [64] Â There was a
cardinal rule that the warriors of the Order should never surrender unless the Templar flag
had fallen, and even then they were first to try to regroup with another of the Christian
orders, such as that of theÂ  Hospitallers . Only after all flags had fallen were they
allowed to leave the battlefield. [65] Â This uncompromising principle, along with their
reputation for courage, excellent training, and heavy armament, made the Templars one of the
most feared combat forces in medieval times. [66]

Initiation, [67] Â known as Reception ( receptio ) into the Order, was a profound
commitment and involved a solemn ceremony. Outsiders were discouraged from attending the
ceremony, which aroused the suspicions ofÂ  medieval inquisitors Â during the
laterÂ  trials .

New members had to willingly sign over all of their wealth and goods to the Order and takeÂ 
vows of poverty, chastity, piety, and obedience . [68] Â Most brothers joined for life,
although some were allowed to join for a set period. Sometimes a married man was allowed to join
if he had his wife’s permission, [59] Â but he was not allowed to wear the white mantle.
[69]

Temple Church , London. As the chapel of the New Temple in London, it was the location for
Templar initiation ceremonies. In modern times it is the parish church of the Middle
Â andÂ  Inner Temples , two of the Inns of Court . It is a popular tourist attraction. See
also:Â  List of places associated with the Knights Templar

With their military mission and extensive financial resources, the Knights Templar funded a
large number of building projects around Europe and the Holy Land. Many of these structures
are still standing. Many sites also maintain the name “Temple” because of centuries-old
association with the Templars. [70] Â For example, some of the Templars’ lands in London
were later rented toÂ  lawyers , which led to the names of theÂ  Temple Bar Â gateway and
theÂ  Temple tube station . Two of the fourÂ  Inns of Court Â which may call members to
act asÂ  barristers Â are theÂ  Inner Temple Â andÂ  Middle Temple .

DistinctiveÂ  architectural Â elements of Templar buildings include the use of the
image of “two knights on a single horse”, representing the Knights’ poverty, and round
buildings designed to resemble theÂ  Church of the Holy Sepulchre Â in Jerusalem. [71]

[ edit ]Modern organizations

Main article:Â  Knights Templar and popular culture

The story of the secretive yet powerful medieval Templars, especially their persecution and
sudden dissolution, has been a tempting source for many other groups which have used alleged
connections with the Templars as a way of enhancing their own image and mystery. [72]
Â There is no clear historical connection between the Knights Templar, which were
dismantled in the 14th century, and any of the modern organizations, of which the earliest
emerged publicly in the 18th century, and are referred to as Neo-Templars by some authors.
[73] [74] [75] [76] [77] Â However, there is often public confusion and many overlook the
400-year gap.

[ edit ]Freemasonry

Main article:Â  Knights Templar (Freemasonry)

Since at least the 18th centuryÂ  Freemasonry Â has incorporated Templar symbols and
rituals in a number ofÂ  Masonic bodies , [5] Â most notably, the “ Order of the Temple
” the final order joined in “The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the
Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta” commonly known as the
Knights Templar. One theory of the origins of Freemasonry claims direct descent from the
historical Knights Templar through its final fourteenth-century members who took refuge
inÂ  Scotland , or other countries where the Templar suppression was not enforced. This
theory is usually deprecated on grounds of lack of evidence, by both Masonic authorities [78]
Â and historians. [79]

[ edit ]Legends and relics

Main article:Â  Knights Templar legends

The Knights Templar have become associated withÂ  legends Â concerningÂ  secrets
and mysteries Â handed down to the select from ancient times. Rumors circulated even
during the time of the Templars themselves. Freemasonic writers added their own
speculations in the 19th century, and further fictional embellishments have been added in
popular novels such asÂ  Ivanhoe ,Â  Foucault’s Pendulum ,Â  The Lost symbol ,
andÂ  The Da Vinci Code ; [5] Â modern movies such as National Treasure Â andÂ 
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ; and video games such asÂ  Assassin’s Creed
Â andÂ  Broken Sword . [80]

Many of the Templar legends are connected with the Order’s early occupation of theÂ 
Temple Mount Â in Jerusalem and speculation about whatÂ  relics Â the Templars may
have found there, such as theÂ  Holy Grail Â or theÂ  Ark of the Covenant . [5] [15] [66]
[81] Â That the Templars were in possession of some relics is certain. Many churches still
display holy relics such as the bones of a saint, a scrap of cloth once worn by a holy man, or the
skull of a martyr; the Templars did the same. They were documented as having a piece of theÂ 
True Cross , which the Bishop of Acre carried into battle at the disastrousÂ  Horns of Hattin
. [82] Â When the battle was lost, Saladin captured the relic, which was then ransomed back
to the Crusaders when the Muslims surrendered the city ofÂ  Acre Â in 1191. [83] Â The
Templars were also known to possess the head ofÂ  Saint Euphemia of Chalcedon , [84] Â and
the subject of relics came up during the Inquisition of the Templars, as several trial
documents refer to the worship of an idol of some type, referred to in some cases as a cat, a
bearded head, or in some cases asÂ  Baphomet . This accusation of idol worship levied
against the Templars has also led to the modern belief by some that the Templars practiced
witchcraft. [85] Â However, modern scholars generally explain the name Baphomet from the
trial documents as simply a French misspelling of the name Mahomet ( Muhammad ). [5] [86]

The Holy Grail quickly became associated with the Templars, even in the 12th century. The
first Grail romance,Â  Le Conte du Graal , was written around 1180 byÂ  ChrÃ©tien de
Troyes , who came from the same area where theÂ  Council of Troyes Â had officially
sanctioned the Templars’ Order. Perhaps twenty years laterÂ  Parzival ,Â  Wolfram
von Eschenbach ‘s version of the tale, refers to knights called “Templeisen” guarding
the Grail Kingdom. [87] Â Another hero of the Grail quest, SirÂ  Galahad Â (a
13th-century literary invention of monks from St. Bernard’s Cistercian Order) was
depicted bearing a shield with the cross ofÂ  Saint George , similar to the Templars’
insignia: this version presented the “Holy” Grail as a Christian relic. A legend
developed that since the Templars had their headquarters at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem,
they must have excavated in search of relics, found the Grail, and then proceeded to keep it in
secret and guard it with their lives. However, in the extensive documents of the Templar
inquisition there was never a single mention of anything like a Grail relic, [14] Â let
alone its possession by the Templars, nor is there any evidence that a Templar wrote a Grail
Romance. [88] Â In reality, most mainstream scholars agree that the story of the Grail was
just that, a literary fiction that began circulating in medieval times. [5] [15]

Another legendary object that is claimed to have some connection with the Templars is theÂ 
Shroud of Turin . In 1357, the shroud was first publicly displayed by a nobleman known as
Geoffrey of Charney, [89] Â described by some sources as being a member of the family of the
grandson ofÂ  Geoffroi de Charney , who was burned at the stake with De Molay. [90] The
shroud’s origins are still a matter of controversy, but in 1988, aÂ  carbon dating
Â analysis concluded that the shroud was made between 1260 and 1390, a span that includes
the last half-century of the Templars’ existence. [91] Â The validity of the dating
methodology has subsequently been called into question, and the age of the shroud is still the
subject of much debate [92] Â despite the existence of a 1389 Memorandum by Bishop Pierre
D’Arcis to the AvignonÂ  Antipope Clement VII Â mentioning that the image had
previously been denounced by his predecessor Henri de Poitiers (Bishop of Troyes
1353-1370), stating “Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered
how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had
painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed

Well hello Everyone,

As promised from this mornings podcast here is an article all about alchemy hope you enjoy!

Definition of Alchemy



Posted byÂ  Domintheos





Image: http://www.consciouscentral.com/images/logo2.jpg

What is alchemy? Â The science of alchemy in practice signifies the process of changing
something common into something special, or an inexplicable and mysterious transmuting of
something. Â The laws of alchemy are based in the fact that the “microcosm” is but an
expression of the “macrocosm”. Â Processes like multiplication, evaporation,
calcination and distillation are all fundamental results of basic alchemy.Â  The
foundation upon which alchemy is performed involves changing base elements into different
forms. Â For example, ancient and true modern alchemists alike mastered the art of
changing base metals into gold, this is known as gold alchemy. Â When a metal like lead is
transmuted into pure 24 karat gold the means for mass production of gold becomes available.
Â In order for this process to actualize the base frequency of lead must be amplified and
transmuted into that of gold. Â Out of gold alchemy was bornÂ  Mono-Atomic Gold Powder
Â  which is composed of trillions of micro gold particles lighter than air. Â When
ingested by a biological being this mystical substance enhances the capability for the
alchemist to express super-physical traits and abilities. Â The art of alchemy answers
many questions that would otherwise be left unknown to the common man. Â Modern alchemy is
practiced in modes very similar to ancient alchemy, yet different as the ancient ways were
more tailored to the arcana. Â There are modern practitioners of arcane alchemy and these
realities will be explained in later paragraphs.

The ability to utilize the electromagnetic grid lines (leylines) of the earth as a means of
transportation is a form of divine alchemy and divine ecology. Â Ancient alchemists
developed knowledge and wisdom of the earths bio-chemistry and spiritual nature. Â By
constructing the land, sea and aircraft to operate off inexhaustable resources ancient
alchemists lived in ecological unison with respect for the planet. Â Ancient alchemists
figured ways to utilize ocean water as a “secondary” fuel source when the designated
vehicle wasn’t within range of a leyline. Â The ability to carve and construct grand
structures in high mountains made of stone, gems and gold were realized through the usage of
alchemy. These realities seem a thing of the past as all modern technologies are based off
exhaustable and primal resources.

The “Caduceus” is the standard symbol of modern medicine. Â This symbol appears to be
two snakes entwined while ascending a staff. Â The true source of all modern medicinal
science and art is alchemy. Â The caduceus, in relation to alchemy signifies positive and
negative energy ( kundalini ) ascending the spinal column towards the brain. Â Modern
pharmaceutics are designed and manufactured with intent to synthetically replicate and
duplicate the bio-chemical blueprint of the body. Â Pharmaceutical drugs serve that
purpose and the healing that’s realized is artificial in relation to the original nature of
the body. Â Ancient “pharmaceutics” were designed, manufactured and constructed
with intent to naturally enhance and aid the evolution of the mind-body-soul complex.
Â This mode of alchemy was performed through utilization of precious earthen matter and
elements including; metals, gems, crystals, and rocks. Â Consciously healthy modes of
lifestyle were generally promoted as well. Â Both the latter forms of “medicinal
healing” are alchemy in practice, the difference lies in the fact that one is authentic and
the other artificial.

Sexual alchemy is the most practiced form of alchemy in our modern world, yet the most
misunderstood and unappreciated. Â When the energies and essence of men and women entwine
there is an ebb and flow that occurs. Â Sexual enlightenment and ecstacy is sourced within
definite transmutation of these energies, as well as the fusion of the male and female
essence. Â  The light (information) that is beckoned and acquired from the experience must
be retained indefinitely, or it will disperse into the Aethers. Â The light is the energy
within the essence that activates “sensation”. Â The true secrets in regard to the
laws of alchemy are coveted above all else, and wield by the very few in our modern world.

Modern alchemy is limited to two dimensions which are the third and fourth dimension of
reality. Â Through religion an alchemist may pray to their diety and possibly recieve an
answer to the prayer. Â Then the alchemists ethereal soul becomes influenced towards a
particular mood or feeling resulting from the experience. Â The latter is an example of
modern spiritual alchemy. Â Another form of modern spiritual alchemy is when one realizes
the truth and reality of all realms within and without ones self. Â This type of realization
has the ability to activate all of the subtle bodies, at the same time. Â This may also be
explained and defined as a “kundalini” awakening or activation. Â Self realization
is the prerequisite for divine apprentinceship and eventual mastery in the modern world,
just as it was in the ancient world. Â The apprentice alchemist knows that self realization
is promoted as the end all be all of our modern day, when it is only the begenning.

Spiritual Alchemy



 

The divine alchemy of man is the science of how the subtle soul correlates to and integrates
with spirit. Â The universe itself is believed to be one, grand spirit. Â The “tree of
life” is a symbol comprised of 13 sephira (celestial bodies) that are believed to represent
the process by which the universe came into being. Â The latter is the macrocosmic
significance of the tree of life. Â Microcosmically the tree of life is a representation of
the path man must take from the lower self to the higher self. Â Most modern renditions of the
tree of life lack the fourth sephira, the world of “Daath”, which means knowledge.
Â All modern renditions of the tree of life lack the 11th and 12th sephira leading to
“Malkuth” ( earth ) the world of the “kingdom”. Â The 11th and 12th sephira
represent the sun and moon that shines and reflects upon Malkuth. Â The path to the higher
self is both a physical and spiritual journey, as the higher-self may be experienced and
realized while incarnate in the physical form. Â One must begin the path back to the higher
self by first entering the 12th portal, which is the moon and is a representation of feminine
energy. Â Then one must succeed in entering the 11th portal, which is our sun and a
representation of masculine energy. Â The next destination is “Yesod” the plane of
“foundation”, which is the world upon which the 8th and 9th sephira shine and reflect
light. Â To become a radical of masculine or feminine energy grounds one to its particular
“world of influence”. Â The latter information is key knowledge when traversing the
paths to the higher self. Â True understanding and wisdom in regard to the microcosmic tree
of life lies within the will and destiny of ones being.

Immortality of spirit is believed to be gained through definite wisdom, understanding and
usage of knowledge in regard to the reality of the tree of life. Â True and eternal
consciousness is realized when one spiritually completes the path to the “Crown”, which
is the first sephira. Â Once the crown is “achieved” consciousness exists in
timelessness, forever. Â Free-will is the foundational basis upon which consciousness
manifests and functions. Â Crowned consciousness posesses the capability to descend
towards the kingdom once more or transcend the existence of man entirely. Â Crowned
“man” lacks the capability to “progress” any further as it is the representation of
perfection. Â The only way to “change” crowned consciousness is to descend into the
worlds. Â The true “elixir of life” is the soul itself.

In alchemical lore, the ability to preserve immortal physical youth was easily achieved
through ingestion of anti-aging supplements containing genetic material, mono-atomic
gold and mono-atomic soul gems ( philosopher stones ). Â Soul gems are said to be created
through means of ritual sacrifice upon which soulful orgone energy is accumulated and
contained within the crystal or gem. Â An example of modern ritual sacrifice may be
represented by death sentencing and execution. Â The inmate is sanctioned to death and
must await the date of execution unless released on new evidence or testimony. Â The ritual
occurs when the inmate is executed in whatever manner, just like many that endured the same
experience in past times. Â When war is engaged the amount of death and destruction
experienced is great. Â During great battles the battlefield is painted red with blood and
is engulfed by soulful orgone energy.Â Â Great spiritual force is ground in such areas
where these rituals occur as there is much energy that seeks retribution or healing in such
places, if not already channeled or consumed.

The filling of soul gems is primarily accomplished through such methods. Â In most cases
the amount of souls and energy collected are astounding in number. Â A dark alchemical
symbol is required to be in place and intact as the symbol is the ward that bounds the soul(s) to
the particular area. Â The symbol must span the entire area itself, or be replicated and
dupicated at key points on or of the area for the event to actualize.Â Â Â An “arcane
channeler” is required to be present in the center of the area with soul gems in order for the
dark act to reach completion. Â This is an extreme example of destructive alchemy as the
soul energies that are channeled are either displaced, or consumed. Â In modern times this
is known as “theocratic vampirism” and is a very serious and detrimental reality. Â In
order for a ritual to take place a certain and specific level of agreement is necessary.
Â One may not be forced to participate in a ritual as the resulting end will not manifest
without proper and mutual acceptance, whether consciously or subconsciously.
Â Free-will is a universal law that must be respected and may not be infringed upon, ever.
Â The latter fact is key towards avoiding such realities and experiences.

Alchemy Symbols



Ancient alchemists cast divine magic on the physical and ethereal plane through utilizing
alchemy circles (mandalas). Â Each alchemy circle resonates a specific creative or
destructive energy. Â Ancient alchemists believed earths subtle worlds and physical
world to occupy the same space in and out of time, only separated by frequency. Â DuringÂ 
astral travels Â , alchemy is used as the primay mode of magicical manifestation by
alchemists both malevolent and benevolent. It is believed that all physical attack and
defense mechanisms are useless in the subtle realities. Inner divine alchemy was and is the
primary mode of creation and destruction for alchemists in the subtle realms. Â Inner
spiritual power may be improved and mastered while incarnate in the physical body, this is an
expression of microcosmic alchemy in practice. Â Beginner alchemists use a subtle form of
“energy” to externally define specific alchemy transmutation circles and guide the
manefesting energies. Â Ancient master alchemists utilize more specialized subtle
forms of matter and energy to form mandalas of any shape and any where. Â Master alchemists
visualize and activate mandalas from within, as opposed to external expressive and
representative forms.

Master alchemical manifestation lies in the definition and the complexity of the dimensions
a mandala comprises. Â A nine dimensional alchemy mandala is much more advanced and
powerful than a three dimensional mandala. Â Subtle Alchemy may be used in the ethereal
world(s) as a means of transportation which include; flying, super travel, teleportation
and defragmentation in their most “basic” forms. Â Ancient alchemy symbols may also
be implemented in order to heal the sick when performed on the physical plane by master
alchemists. Â The latter is also an advanced mode of performing modern reiki.
Â Spiritual alchemists recognized and accepted the subtle worlds to be reality, just as
real as the physical world. Â Symbols of alchemy are defined by the particular energy the
mandala is influenced and manipulated by. Â Ancient spiritual alchemy connects the
physical aspect of alchemy with the metaphysical aspect, so alchemists may function in
unison with the universal nature of all reality.
