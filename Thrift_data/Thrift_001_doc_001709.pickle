Have people from the dawn of time always taught their children \n                                        in school houses? Well interesting enough, education of young people has existed \n                                        since the dawn of mankind; beginning with tribal communities whose elders were \n                                        responsible for teaching a secret knowledge to boys who reach puberty. This \n                                        secret knowledge was treated as spiritual in nature because it was the knowledge \n                                        of how to survive in the wilderness, as well as how to distinguish what plant \n                                        foods were good to eat in their season. In conjunction with this education was \n                                        learning how to build shelters sufficient for protecting himself as well as a \n                                        wife and future family from the elements of the local area.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              Thus education began as a very meaningful experience which was handled as sacred \n                                        because the recipient would live or die based upon the receipt of this \n                                        knowledge. The successful completion of training by village elders was tested in \n                                        a unique ceremony defined as a rite of passage, firmly establishing a \n                                        demarcation between childhood and manhood. The impetus to learn this essential \n                                        knowledge was reinforced by knowing that life or death were the ultimate \n                                        evaluation of a test that didn\'t have a letter grade but simply a pass and live \n                                        or, fail and die score.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; " class="Apple-style-span">\n                                <img style="-webkit-user-select: none; width: 657px; text-align: center;" src="http://1004.al7mi.com/image/ngc2174top.jpg"></img>\n                              </span>\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              So how did education change from the definitely meaningful community based \n                                        sacred rite conveying the essential knowledge of how to live in harmony with \n                                        nature, to the very arbitrary meaningless system of education that exists today? \n                                        Naturally the investigation of this question does take a bit of thought and may \n                                        appear less than parsimonious, however considering I survived both the system of \n                                        institutional education and the education in nature, there is something to say \n                                        about this matter.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              As mention briefly in the foregoing page, my life as an educator began when I \n                                        was twenty seven years old while I was still pursuing graduate level research in \n                                        theoretical physics at the University of California San Diego. This web page \n                                        contains a small segment of by personal biography which explains the traumatic \n                                        event that changed my life in a profound way. Suffice it to say that after this \n                                        event many parts of my life began to change in a very rapid way. The most \n                                        significant change occurred in the manner of work that employed my life; before \n                                        the profound event, my employment was with the department of defense in the \n                                        United States Navy where I served humanity by servicing communication equipment \n                                        for high technology machines of death and destruction (please consider what an\n                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_F-14_Tomcat" shape="rect">F14 Tomcat </a>\n                              Jet aircraft is designed for). After the traumatic life changing \n                                        event (which just happened to occur just before my honorably discharge from the \n                                        Navy), I soon found myself at the end of a semester of study, at the end of my \n                                        Navy career and one special night, homeless.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              <a name="hotword" shape="rect"></a>\n                              Having a love for the outdoors and camping, I carried my \n                                        backpack with me everywhere; in this unique love for the outdoors imparted by my \n                                        father, as he took me on numerous camping trips to may beautiful areas of \n                                        wilderness beauty, I unknowingly acquired some of the\n                              <font size="3" face="Times New Roman, serif" color="#000000">\n                                <span style="font-style: normal"> </span>\n                              </font>\n                              <font size="3" face="Times New Roman, serif" color="#000000">\n                                <span style="font-style: normal">\n                                  <span style="font-weight: normal">\n                                    <span style="background: transparent">primordial </span>\n                                  </span>\n                                </span>\n                              </font>\n                              secret knowledge which allowed a son to survive in the wilderness. A key point \n                                        to recognize at this juncture is the common denominator of a spiritual dimension \n                                        associated with both the traumatic event that threatened my life and the mystery \n                                        of secret knowledge conveyed by my father during my childhood. Why would I point \n                                        out this common denominator as a critical juncture? This is indicated now \n                                        because it is an important component when one investigates the origin of \n                                        education as it exists today.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> \xc2\xa0</p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              In brief review before pressing on, the catastrophic event where my life was \n                                        threatened by powerful people associated with organized crime brought me to a \n                                        place where every conceivable refuge was removed, all friends ran away in fear, \n                                        I couldn\'t leave the house without the threat of being shot by people who \n                                        certainly didn\'t want me to inform the authorities about their intentions. Alone \n                                        in a kitchen on that dark night I did something for the first time in my life, \n                                        something that I have had to repeat through my life since that time each \n                                        followed by an event of such power that words fail to detail the awesomness. \n                                        However, the most recent encounter with this incredible power has been detailed \n                                        in the story I wrote about an event in the\n                              <a href="http://al7mi.com/history/2010/100701.htm" shape="rect">Convergence </a>\n                              of two rivers \n                                        here in Alaska. Such inexplicable events bringing wonder and beauty have a \n                                        spiritual dimension to them. My career in teaching began after this first event \n                                        when I was in my late twenties.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              As I was saying, I had been evicted by tenants from my friend\'s house during a \n                                        time when tenants grew weary of my incessant nagging associated with how wet and \n                                        dirty they left the communal areas of the bathroom and kitchen. With no landlord \n                                        to defend myself imposed position as proxy landlord, the agitated tenants from \n                                        India enlisted the help of a rather tall black tenant and the hulking strength \n                                        of similarity disgruntled marine soldier tenant. It didn\'t take long for them to \n                                        collectively but not so neatly gather my belongings and throw them on the \n                                        sidewalk in front of the garage as a landing area as my body was collectively \n                                        lifted and thrown on top of my belongings.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              It was in southern California in the early evening that this happened. Not \n                                        having many belongings except my tent, sleeping bag and cooking gear, I picked \n                                        myself up off the ground fortunately unharmed and began to stow my gear in my \n                                        back pack. Unknown to me the neighbor in the house next to the one I had been \n                                        tossed out of had been watching. I had met him in recent days before and found \n                                        that he and I had something in common, that was a knowledge and identity of what \n                                        changed my life the night my friends left me to the fate of thugs from local \n                                        organized crime. In the cool of the evening he greeted me over the fence as I \n                                        packed my backpack and hoist it on to my back.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              This greeting of his was simple and kind, \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93It a nice evening tonight isn\'t it?\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd \n                                        At first I was surprised he didn\'t mention anything about the dramatic eviction \n                                        which he witnessed, but I just said, \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Yeah it been quite an evening.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and began \n                                        to walk slowly down the sidewalk trying to figure out where I could safely camp \n                                        that night. The neighbor followed me along his property line and asked me where \n                                        I was off to. I told him I had to find a place to camp because my house mates \n                                        figure it would be the best thing for me to do. To my surprise, the neighbor \n                                        said, \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93You are very welcome to stay in my house if you would like.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd I was very \n                                        surprised at his invitation since I knew he had a couple of grade school \n                                        children which I witnessed playing in the back yard on a number of occasions. I \n                                        did a double take figuring I must have heard him wrong so I asked him what he \n                                        said. In response he repeated that I was welcome to come into his house to sleep \n                                        rather than camp out in an urban area.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              What came out of this friendly invitation which had all the semblance of a \n                                        meeting with a celestial angel was the amazing discovery that he was a teacher \n                                        at a high school near UCDS where I had been doing my studies. The one night stay \n                                        turned into an on going residence with this man and his children. He was a \n                                        Christian and attended church faithfully which he invited me to visit. I had \n                                        never been in a church since I was a kid when my mother forced me to go to \n                                        something I really hated. I was apprehensive about my neighbors invitation, but \n                                        later found out the the church he went to had many people with the same kind \n                                        caring attitude that he had shown me.\n                              <img style="-webkit-user-select: none; width: 658px; margin-right: 0px;" src="http://1004.al7mi.com/image/ngc2174mid.jpg"></img>\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> \xc2\xa0</p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              After church we had dinner together with his children and he showed me something \n                                        very fascinating; it was a computer and a modem which allowed him to connect to \n                                        the main computer at the school where he worked. I was intrigued by what he \n                                        showed me and the evening went on to a game of chess which I played against the \n                                        computer at the school where is worked as a math teacher. He asked me if I was \n                                        interested in computers to which I enthusiastically said yes. After seeing my \n                                        excitement about computers, he invited me to school with him the next day and \n                                        see the computer lab which was associated with the math department. What \n                                        transpired in the eight hours that I was there would be the most dynamic event \n                                        of my life.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              It was the excitement of being able to operate a powerful computer system \n                                        directly from within his classroom technology lab that first motivated me but \n                                        what I didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t expected was the chance to meet his students. Something amazing \n                                        happened as my rapport with the students was vary comfortable and natural as if \n                                        I had finally discovered my purpose in life. My fascination with the computers \n                                        allowed me to discover things about the workings of a computer and with each \n                                        discovery the students of his class discovered along with me; in time the \n                                        discoveries became mutual as students showed me what they had learned and I \n                                        showed them what I had found out.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              Everything happened so fast and I was soon lost in the world of discovery with \n                                        students as if it were the most natural part of my life like breathing. I found \n                                        that each night I would return to my neighbors house and made a request of him \n                                        that he thought unusual and that was to sleep outside in my tent in his fenced \n                                        in backyard. He said you are welcome to stay in my house and that I did, except \n                                        for sleeping which I simply liked to do outside. This he understood and by the \n                                        flower garden I set my tent in place.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              My daily visits to his school were the highlight of each day and he could \n                                        perceive I enjoyed interacting with the students. It was a few weeks later at \n                                        his home after a busy day at school that he had an offer to speak to me about. \n                                        He explained that his school needed to hire someone to serve as an in house \n                                        substitute teacher and wondered if I would be interested. I was thrilled with \n                                        the offer and took him up on it immediately. The next day I met the principal \n                                        who was very cordial and explained the requirements of the teaching position. He \n                                        said that since I was close to graduating at UCSD I had the qualifications to \n                                        teach as an in house substitute teacher.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              My time teaching at the high school was so wonderful, \n                                        not because of money, but because it provided a wonderful chance for interaction with the \n                                        students. As each week went by, I was staying later and later at the school to \n                                        prepare for classes I had to teach the next day. Since I began my work in \n                                        connection with my neighbor who taught in the math department, I made a place \n                                        for myself in the math lab where I used the computer to develop lesson plans. In \n                                        the beginning I would stay after school for thirty minutes during which many \n                                        student would ask if they could come in and use the computers while I prepared; \n                                        I told them sure. I let the students use the computers as long as I was there. \n                                        What came out of this habit was totally amazing.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              By the end of the first month I was staying after school for an hour or more. By \n                                        the second month I was staying at school in the lab doing work until 9 pm and as \n                                        I did this, students continued to populate the computer labs at night in large \n                                        numbers. Finally the principal began receiving phone calls from parents to thank \n                                        him for keeping the school open so late. Because the school was open late at \n                                        night, parents discovered that their children were no longer in the streets at \n                                        night getting in trouble bu were choosing to be in school working, experimenting \n                                        and learning with the computers. The principal was surprised that I was staying \n                                        so late allowing students to learn and explore without asking for extra pay; he \n                                        was so happy with the parents and community positive response that he decided to \n                                        give me my own office to work with students directly and more effectively.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              So this far I have explained the foundation of education as being the \n                                        transmission of essential frequently referred to as \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93secret\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd knowledge, which \n                                        conveyed to young men the power to survive in nature by learning special or \n                                        \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93secret\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd skills associated with an elder\'s life time experience of living with \n                                        the forces of nature. The elders knew there were forces in nature that could be \n                                        seen for which skills were taught by the community elders. Also there were \n                                        forces of nature that were not perceived by the senses yet the knowledge of was \n                                        intimately associated with survival, however this knowledge was defined by the \n                                        spirit world of animals and nature. The key point in this is the relationship \n                                        between education being an knowledge of the physical worlds balanced with \n                                        knowledge of the spirit world. How does my personal story regarding how I became \n                                        connected with education and students relate? I will press on to answer this \n                                        question before returning to explore the origin of education as it exists today.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              <br clear="none"></br>\n                              How does a person account for the changes that brings a life of daily \n                                        maintenance of (\n                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_F-14_Tomcat" shape="rect">F 14 Tomcats</a>\n                              ) machines used to expedite death and destruction on a large scale \n                                        and nightly dabbling with recreational pharmacology and the default connection \n                                        to organized crime to one of being a teacher of students all in a span of two \n                                        weeks? Any person reading this could write it off as a lie, but this is not \n                                        accurate. As a truth, how does one explain such a radical change in life styles? \n                                        If I make public proclamation of my innate greatness to account for such a \n                                        radical transition of life, there would have to be some kind of carry over of \n                                        habits from my old life, however the authenticity of a genuine change of life is \n                                        revealed through the lives of people who exert intensive scrutiny when it comes \n                                        to examining a stranger who appears one day at their school. Parents \n                                        instinctively do this in order to protect the children born to them. It is this \n                                        overwhelming unsolicited vindication of my life by parents of children with whom \n                                        I worked, before a community and a school principal which authenticates a change \n                                        in my life not possible by human standards. To go from a life in service to \n                                        darkness to one where parents descend upon a principals office in person and by \n                                        phone to express their gratitude for a program that keeps their children away \n                                        from paths that could lead them into life styles associated with the same drugs \n                                        and destruction that I came out of, is no small matter. No, there is no person \n                                        able to make such a transition from working with diabolically dark forces of \n                                        drug abuse and military carnage to one where children are entrusted to them as a \n                                        substitute teacher who works with them until the late hours of the night at \n                                        school. Any explanation that indicates personal effort related to education \n                                        through matter involving the physical world simply can\'t account for such a \n                                        transition in life. Coming full circle to balance my personal testimony with the \n                                        process of original education, this change in my life is attributed to matters \n                                        of the Spirit and the world of the unseen.\n                            </p>\n                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">\n                              This bicameral explanation for the process of authentic education in the lives \n                                        of native tribal communities was replicated in the process of my personal \n                                        leaning and as I hope to show, was preserved by the church through the fall of \n                                        Rome and the Dark Ages. The current view of education emerged from a\n                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages#Transmission_of_learning" shape="rect"> transmission of learning</a>\n                              which held a close connection between learning \n                                        related to the physical world and learning related to the spirit world as the \n                                        church taught the God is the originator of all truth.

If anyone briefly \n                                        analyzes the seals of many universities, they will find that God or God\'s Word \n                                        both personally or the inspired written account is clearly indicated as the \n                                        prime connections between knowledge and truth.

Here \n                                        was a woman who professed faith in God and actually made effort to develop an \n                                        education methodology that fulfill the original tribal education method for \n                                        survival in the real world. By taking student out to the world of nature she \n                                        immersed them in a natural classroom which by it\'s location and environment, \n                                        would leave a life long impression on childrens\' lives.
