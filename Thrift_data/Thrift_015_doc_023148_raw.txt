[ edit ] History



Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche , the company was early on known for producing
various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass
produce synthetic vitamin C , under the brand name Redoxon . In 1957 it introduced the class of
tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known
members). Its acne drug isotretinoin , marketed as Accutane and Roaccutane, also used as a
form of chemotherapy for some cancers, has been linked with a number of severe side effects and
remains highly controversial but highly effective at the same time. Roche has also produced
various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs . It bought the patents for the polymerase chain
reaction technique in 1992. It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs.

In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso , Italy owned by a subsidiary of Roche
caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster .

In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for
US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington,
North Carolina . That year Hoffmannâ€“La Roche then merged it with all of its
laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc.
in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical
laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in
sales. [ 4 ]

On April 28, 1995 Hoffmannâ€“La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to
National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory
Corporation of America Holdings ). [ 5 ] In 1994, Roche acquired Syntex .

On 12 March 2009 Roche agreed to fully acquire Genentech , in which it had held a majority stake
since 1990, [ 6 ] after 8 months of negotiations. As a result of the Genentech acquisition,
Roche plans to close its Palo Alto based research facilities to move research to south San
Francisco and Nutley campuses [ 7 ] Genentech became a wholly-owned subsidiary group of Roche
on 25 March 2009. [ 8 ]

[ edit ] Creation of the first anti-depressant



In 1956, Iproniazid was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing
Isoniazid . Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting
Tuberculosis . Iproniazid , however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it
made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic
side-effects.

[ edit ] Vitamin price fixing



Stanley Adams , Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic
Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in
price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined
accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was
Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure â€” an
offence under Swiss law â€” and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face
decades in jail, committed suicide. [ 9 ] Adams was released soon after but arrested again more
than once before eventually fleeing to Britain, where he wrote a book about the affair, Roche
Versus Adams (London, 1984, ISBN 022402180X ).

In 1999 Roche was the worldwide market leader in vitamins, with a market share of 40%. Between
1990 and 1999, the company continued to participate in an illegal price fixing cartel for
vitamins, which also included BASF and Rhone-Poulenc SA . In 1999, Roche pleaded guilty in the
United States and paid a US$500 million fine, then the largest fine ever secured in the U.S. [ 10
] The European Commission fined Roche â‚¬ 462 million for the same infraction in 2001,
also a record fine at the time. [ 9 ]

Roche sold its vitamin business in late 2002 to the Dutch group DSM .

[ edit ] Products



Drugs produced by Roche include Xenical , Valium , Roaccutane , Zenapax , Valcyte , Bactrim ,
Tarceva , CellCept , Bonviva , Xeloda and Tamiflu .

[ edit ] Oseltamivir Controversy



In a recent meeting of regional health ministers, Dr. Francisco J. Duque III, Secretary of the
Philippines Department of Health, accused Roche of "monopolizing" the production and
distribution of the drug known as Oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu). Oseltamivir is
considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as
the bird flu . Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was
discovered by Gilead Sciences . Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005
settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14-22% of annual net
sales. [ 11 ]

The Philippine health secretary complained that the supply of the said drug is only
concentrated in First World countries even if the disease is ravaging bird and poultry
populations in Southeast Asia as of this time. Dr. Duque proposed that even if Roche is the only
one who has the patent for the drug, special patents or licenses should be granted to other drug
companies to manufacture the drug and make it more accessible to avian flu-vulnerable
countries in Southeast Asia such as Vietnam , Indonesia , Cambodia and the Philippines . Duque
and Philippine president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have already communicated with the
representative of the World Health Organization in the Philippines asking for assistance in
calling for greater production and distribution of Oseltamivir. [ citation needed ]

Wikinews has related news: Taiwan to violate Tamiflu patent in order to compensate for
vaccine shortage

World leaders, such as former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , have expressed a desire to have
more generic versions of Tamiflu made, especially for Third World countries too poor to buy
the brand name drug. [ citation needed ]

On 20 October 2005, Hoffmannâ€“La Roche decided to license other companies to
manufacture Oseltamivir. [ 12 ]

[ edit ] Collaborative research



In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmannâ€“La Roche is
also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial
and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the
InnoMed PredTox . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The company is expanding its activities in joint research
projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the
European Commission . [ 15 ]
