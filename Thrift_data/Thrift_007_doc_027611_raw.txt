Outlaws Fans Not Happy After Shawano Race Postponement

Race fans angry about Outlaws postponement

Race rescheduled for Tuesday; refunds available

It was late when a wet track forced the postponement of Wednesday’s World of Outlaws Late
Model Series race at the Shawano Speedway, and some fans were not happy.

“We sat in our chairs last night and the guy that was speaking said, ‘The race is going to be
full-tilt, full throttle,’” said Ed Marohl of Bonduel , who attended the race with his
son. “That was approximately at 7:45 p.m. So, I kind of had my hopes up. You don’t need to be a
rocket scientist, but you couldn’t race a bicycle around that track last night.”

He blames Shawano Speedway workers for not properly preparing the track for the race.

A rain shower had moved through Shawano that afternoon and left the track too wet to race.
Efforts to dry and compact the track weren’t successful, prompting track and WoO officials
to postpone the race until Tuesday.

“We did everything we could to prepare the track for them, but they felt it was not a suitable
track to race on,” said Dale Hodkiewicz, Shawano Speedway president.
