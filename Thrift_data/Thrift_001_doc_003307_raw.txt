Sociology is a branch of the social sciences that uses systematic methods of empirical
investigation [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and critical analysis [ 3 ] to develop and refine a body of knowledge
about human social structure and activity, sometimes with the goal of applying such
knowledge to the pursuit of social welfare. Its subject matter ranges from the micro level of
face-to-face interaction to the macro level of societies at large.

Sociology is a broad discipline in terms of both methodology and subject matter. Its
traditional focuses have included social relations , social stratification , social
interaction , culture and deviance , and its approaches have included both qualitative and
quantitative research techniques. As much of what humans do fits under the category of social
structure or social activity, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to such far-flung
subjects as the study of economic activity , health disparities , and even the role of social
activity in the creation of scientific knowledge . The range of social scientific methods has
also been broadly expanded. The " cultural turn " of the 1970s and 1980s brought more
humanistic interpretive approaches to the study of culture in sociology. Conversely, the
same decades saw the rise of new mathematically rigorous approaches, such as social network
analysis.

History of sociology Main article: History of sociology

Auguste Comte

Sociological reasoning is much older than the term â€œsociology.â€� Sociology,
including economic, political, and cultural systems, has proto-sociological origins in
the common stock of human knowledge and philosophy . Social analysis has been carried out by
scholars and philosophers from at least as early as the time of Plato .

The term " sociology " was first used in 1780 by the French essayist Emmanuel Joseph SieyÃšs
(1748-1836) in an unpublished manuscript. [ 4 ]

The word was later used in 1838 by the French thinker Auguste Comte . [ 5 ] Comte had earlier used
the term "social physics", but that term had subsequently been appropriated by others,
notably Adolphe Quetelet . Comte hoped to unify history, psychology and economics. He
believed that society's acquisition of knowledge passed through three basic stages:
theological , metaphysical , and positive . Comte argued that if society could grasp the
structure of this progress, it could prescribe suitable remedies for social ills. [ 6 ] Comte
has come to be viewed as the "Father of Sociology". [ 6 ]

Sociology later evolved, as a scientific discipline, as an academic response to the
challenges of modernity and modernization , such as industrialization and urbanization ,
that emerged in the early 19th century.



[ edit ] Key figures



"Classical" theorists of sociology from the late 19th and early 20th centuries include
Vilfredo Pareto , Karl Marx , Ludwig Gumplowicz , Ferdinand TÃ¶nnies , Ã‰mile Durkheim ,
Herbert Spencer , Georg Simmel , Max Weber , and George Herbert Mead . Like Comte, these figures
did not consider themselves only "sociologists". Their works addressed religion ,
education , economics , law , psychology , ethics , philosophy and theology . Their theories
have been applied in a variety of academic disciplines and beyond. Each key figure is
typically associated with a particular theoretical perspective and orientation used to
interpret and understand human behaviour.

Other significant figures include Zygmunt Bauman , Ulrich Beck , Howard Becker , Daniel Bell ,
Peter Berger , Peter Blau , Herbert Blumer , Pierre Bourdieu , Dieter Claessens , Randall
Collins , Charles Horton Cooley , Lewis A. Coser , Ralf Dahrendorf , W. E. B. Dubois , Norbert
Elias , Gilberto Freyre , Michel Foucault , Herbert Gans , Harold Garfinkel , Anthony Giddens ,
Erving Goffman , Stuart Hall , George Homans , Bruno Latour , Thomas Luckmann , Karl Mannheim ,
Marcel Mauss , Robert K. Merton , Robert Michels , C. Wright Mills , Talcott Parsons , Anselm
Strauss , Gabriel Tarde , W. I. Thomas , John Urry , Thorstein Veblen , Immanuel Wallerstein ,
and Jeffrey Weeks .



[ edit ] Institutionalizing sociology as an academic discipline



The discipline was taught under its own name for the first time in 1890, at the University of
Kansas , Lawrence . The course, whose title was Elements of Sociology , was first taught by
Frank Blackmar . It is the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States. The
Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas, the first fully fledged
independent university in the United States, was established in 1891. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The department
of sociology at the University of Chicago was established in 1892 by Albion W. Small , who, in
1895, founded the American Journal of Sociology . [ 9 ]

Ã‰mile Durkheim

The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895, at the University of Bordeaux
by Ã‰mile Durkheim , founder of L'AnnÃ©e Sociologique (1896). The first sociology
department to be established in the United Kingdom was at the London School of Economics and
Political Science (home of the British Journal of Sociology ) in 1904. [ 10 ] In 1919, a
sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of
Munich by Max Weber , and in 1920 in Poland by Florian Znaniecki .

International co-operation in sociology began in 1893, when RenÃ© Worms founded the
Institut International de Sociologie , which was later eclipsed by the much larger
International Sociological Association (ISA), founded in 1949. [ 11 ] In 1905, the American
Sociological Association , the world's largest association of professional sociologists,
was founded, and in 1909 the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃŒr Soziologie ( German Society for
Sociology ) was founded by Ferdinand TÃ¶nnies and Max Weber , among others.



[ edit ] Positivism and anti-positivism

Max Weber

The methodological approach towards sociology by early theorists, led by Comte, was to treat
it in much the same manner as natural science , applying much the same methods as those used in
the natural sciences. The emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method sought to provide
an incontestable foundation for any sociological claims or findings, and to distinguish
sociology from less empirical fields such as philosophy . This methodological approach,
called positivism , is based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is
scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can come only from positive affirmation of
theories through strict scientific and quantitative methods.

Reactions against positivism began when German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism,
which he viewed as overly mechanistic. [ 12 ] Although Karl Marx's dialectical materialism
â€”as Marx's colleague Friedrich Engels referred to his and Marx's
methodologyâ€”contrasted sharply with Hegel's idealism , his methodology was
Hegelian insofar as it rejected positivism in favour of critical analysis, which seeks to
supplement the empirical acquisition of "facts" with the elimination of illusions. [ 13 ] As
critical theorists David Ashley and David Michael Orenstein observe, "Marx often pointed
out that rational inquiry would be superfluous if the essence of things coincided directly
with appearances"; [ 14 ] Marx thus understood that appearances need to be critiqued, not
simply documented.

Other philosophers, including Heinrich Rickert and even the empiricist Wilhelm Dilthey ,
questioned positivist and naturalist approaches to studying social life . Rickert and
Dilthey argued that the natural world differs from the social world because of unique aspects
of human society, such as meanings, symbols , rules , norms , and values , all of which inform
human cultures . This view was further developed by Max Weber , who introduced the term
antipositivism . According to this view, which is closely related to antinaturalism ,
sociological research should concentrate on human cultural values , symbols , and social
processes viewed from a subjective perspective.

Weber was a hermeneuticist, more interested in interpreting subjective meaning than in
charting objective action. Yet he also felt that sociology should be a "science", able to
identify causal relationshipsâ€”especially among ideal types , or hypothetical
simplifications of complex social phenomena. [ 15 ] As a nonpositivist, however, Weber
recognized that the selection and construction of ideal types was itself a subjective
process, and realized that, unlike the causal relationships sought in positivistic
science, those found between ideal types are not "ahistorical, invariant, or
generalizable." [ 16 ] For example, Ashley and Orenstein point out that Weber, in his seminal
work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism , did not intend to suggest that the
spirit of capitalism could not flourish outside the Protestant ethic (it has) or that factors
outside the Protestant ethic did not contribute to the spirit of capitalism in the West (they
did). What mattered to Weber was that the relationship between the two factors helped to
distinguish the character of Western Europeâ€”and the meaning derived by the subjects
in itâ€”from the rest of the world. [ 17 ]

Ã‰mile Durkheim was a major proponent of empirical sociological research, [ 18 ] both
qualitative and quantitative. For example, he used ethnographic data to theorize about the
social origins of religion , and compiled statistical information in order to understand the
social roots of suicide . Yet his empirical bent may be overstated, perhaps as a result of the
co-opting of his theories by the American positivist Talcott Parsons. [ 19 ] Durkheim
gathered data, not for data's sake, but in order to understand and promote social evolution
and reform. [ 19 ] Additionally, therefore, the original spirit of Durkheim's work may have
become distorted by a growing disjuncture between institutionalized academia on the one
hand, and the agitation and dynamics of reform and progress on the other. [ 19 ]



[ edit ] Twentieth-century developments

An example of a social network diagram.

In the early 20th century, sociology expanded in the United States of America , including
developments in both macrosociology , concerned with the evolution of societies , and
microsociology , concerned with everyday human social interactions. Based on the pragmatic
social psychology of George Herbert Mead , Herbert Blumer and, later, the Chicago school ),
sociologists developed symbolic interactionism . [ 20 ]

In Europe, in the Interwar period , sociology generally was both attacked by increasingly
totalitarian governments and rejected by conservative universities. At the same time,
originally in Austria and later in the U.S., Alfred SchÃŒtz developed social
phenomenology , which would later inform social constructionism . Also, members of the
Frankfurt school , most of whom moved to the U.S. to escape Nazi persecution, developed
critical theory , integrating critical, idealistic and historical materialistic elements
of the dialectical philosophies of Hegel and Marx with the insights of Freud , Max Weber
â€”in theory, if not always in nameâ€”and others. In the 1930s in the U.S., Talcott
Parsons developed action theory which integrated the study of social order and the
voluntaristic aspects of macro and micro structural factors, while placing this discussion
within a higher epistemological and explanatory context of system theory and cybernetics.

Since World War II , sociology has been revived in Europe, although during the Stalin and Mao
eras it was suppressed in the communist countries. In the mid-20th century, there was a
generalâ€”but not universalâ€”trend for U.S.-American sociology to be more
scientific in nature, due partly to the prominence at that time of action theory and other
system-theoretical approaches. Sociologists developed new types of quantitative and
qualitative research methods. In the second half of the 20th century, sociological research
has been increasingly employed as a tool by governments and businesses. Parallel with the
rise of various social movements in the 1960s, theories emphasizing social struggle,
including conflict theory , which sought to counter so-called "functionalist approaches."
Neomarxist theories had a brief renaissance and thereafter declined.

The positivist tradition continues to be highly influential in sociology, especially in the
United States, where a large number of the world's sociologists reside and practice [ 21 ] . The
discipline's two leading American journals, American Journal of Sociology and American
Sociological Review , primarily publish research in the positivist tradition, with ASR
exhibiting greater diversity (the British Journal of Sociology , on the other hand,
publishes primarily non-positivist articles) [ 21 ] . The twentieth century saw significant
improvements to the quantitative methodologies employed in sociology. The development of
longitudinal studies that follow the same population over the course of years or decades
enabled researchers to study long-term phenomena and increased their ability to infer
causality . The vast increase in the size of data sets produced by the new survey methodologies
was followed by the invention of new statistical techniques for analyzing this data. The
analysis of this data is usually done with statistical software packages such as Stata or SPSS
.

Social network analysis is an example of a new paradigm in the positivist tradition. The
influence of social network analysis is pervasive in many sociological sub fields such as
economic sociology (see the work of J. Clyde Mitchell , Harrison White , or Mark Granovetter ,
for example), organizational behavior , historical sociology , political sociology , or the
sociology of education . There is also a minor revival of a more independent, empirical
sociology in the spirit of C. Wright Mills , and his studies of the Power Elite in the United
States of America, according to Stanley Aronowitz. [ 22 ]



[ edit ] Sociological debates



Throughout the development of sociology, controversies have raged about how to emphasize or
integrate concerns with subjectivity , objectivity , intersubjectivity and practicality
in theory and research. The extent to which sociology may be characterized as a " science " has
remained an area of considerable debate, which has addressed basic ontological and
epistemological philosophical questions. One outcome of such disputes has been the ongoing
formation of multidimensional theories of society, such as the continuing development of
various types of critical theory . Another outcome has been the formation of public sociology
, which emphasizes the usefulness of sociological analysis to various social groups .

******************************************************

Scope and topics of sociology

Sociology as a discipline never had well-defined boundaries. Although throughout the early
19th century it was primarily concerned with the social organization of complex industrial
societies , it has now expanded into the traditional areas of anthropology , economics , and
political science with the study of non-Western societies, culture , economic activity and
politics (just as, in many cases, those disciplines extended into the traditional areas of
sociology).



[ edit ] The Internet

Main article: Sociology of the Internet

The Internet is of interest to sociologists in various ways. The Internet can be used as a tool
for research (for example, conducting online questionnaires), a discussion platform, and
as a research topic. Sociology of the Internet in the broad sense includes analysis of online
communities (i.e. newsgroups , social networking sites) and virtual worlds .
Organizational change is catalyzed through new media like the Internet, thereby
influencing social change at-large . This creates the framework for a transformation from an
industrial to an informational society (see Manuel Castells). Online communities can be
studied statistically through network analysis and at the same time interpreted
qualitatively through virtual ethnography . Social change can be studied through
statistical demographics , or through the interpretation of changing messages and symbols
in online media studies .

Practical applications of sociology

Â 

Sociological research informs educators , planners , lawmakers , administrators ,
developers , business leaders , and people interested in resolving social problems and
formulating public policy .

Public sociology is an approach to sociology that seeks to engage wider audiences and become,
in the words of Michael Burawoy , the "mirror and conscience of society". Main article: social
research

Methods of sociological inquiry vary. The type of methodology used researching sociology is
predicated upon the theoretical orientation of the researcher(s). The basic goal of
sociological research is to understand the social world in its many forms. Quantitative
methods and qualitative methods are two main types of sociological research . Sociologists
often use the quantitative methods , such as social statistics or network analysis to
investigate the structure of a social process or describe patterns in social relationships.
Sociologists also often use the qualitative methods such as focused interviews , group
discussions and ethnographic methods to investigate social processes. Sociologists also
use applied research methods such as evaluation research and assessment .

    The following list of research methods is neither exclusive nor exhaustive.
    Researchers may adopt one or more than one type of research methodology for a research
    project. Types of research methods include the following:

    - Archival research : sometimes referred to as "Historical Method". This research uses
    information from a variety of historical records such as biographies, memoirs and news
    releases.

    

    - Content analysis : The contents of interviews and questionnaires are analyzed using
    systematic approaches. An example of this type of research methodology is known as
    "grounded theory." Books and mass media are also analyzed to study how people
    communicate and the messages people talk or write about.

    

    - Experimental research : The researcher isolates a single social process or social
    phenomena and uses the data to either confirm or construct social theory. Participants
    (also referred to as "subjects") are randomly assigned to various conditions or
    "treatments", and then analyses are made between groups. Randomization allows the
    researcher to be sure that the treatment is having the effect on group differences and not
    any extraneous factors.

    

    - Survey research : The researcher obtains data from interviews, questionnaires, or
    similar feedback from a set of people chosen (including random selection) to represent a
    particular population of interest. Survey items from an interview or questionnaire may
    be open-ended or closed-ended.

    

    - Life history : This is the study of the personal life trajectories. Through a series of
    interviews, the researcher can probe into the decisive moments or various influences in
    their life.

    

    - Longitudinal study : This is an extensive examination of a specific person or group over
    a long period of time.

    

    - Observation : Using data from the senses, one records information about social
    phenomenon or behavior. Observation techniques can be either participant observation
    or non-participant observation. In participant observation, the researcher goes into
    the field (such as a community or a place of work), and participates in the activities of
    the field for a prolonged period of time in order acquire a deep understanding of it. Data
    acquired through these techniques may be analyzed either quantitatively or
    qualitatively.

    



The choice of a method in part often depends on the researcher's epistemological approach to
research as well as the researchers theoretical perspective. For example, researchers who
are concerned with a statistical generalization to assign to a population will most likely
administer structured interviews with a survey questionnaire to a carefully selected
sample population. By contrast, sociologists, especially ethnographers, who are more
interested in having a full contextual understanding of group members lives will choose
participant observation , observation, and open-ended interviews. Many studies combine
several of these methodologies. Adopting three (3) methodologies is referred to as
"triangulation".

As is the case in most disciplines, sociologists are often divided into distinctive camps of
support for particular research methodologies. This is based upon the researcher's
theoretical orientation. In practice, some sociologists combine different research
methods and approaches, since different methods produce different types of findings that
correspond to different aspects of societies. For example, quantitative methods may help
describe social patterns , while qualitative approaches could help to understand how
individuals understand those patterns. This, however, does not mean that a qualitative
approach can not identify or define patterns of behavior. Nonetheless, the method of
analysis of the data obtained from a research methodology may be qualitative, quantitative
or both.

Sociology and other social sciences

Sociology shares deep ties with a wide array of other disciplines that also deal with the study
of society. The fields of anthropology , economics , political science and psychology have
influenced and have been influenced by sociology and these fields share a great amount of
history and common research interests. Social psychology within sociology is often
referred to as "sociological social psychology". Two of the founders of social psychology as
we understand it today are Muzafer Sherif and Carolyn Wood Sherif [ citation needed ] , known
for their work on the Robbers Cave Experiment [ 23 ] . The Sherifs also wrote several editions of
"An Outline of Social Psychology" [ 24 ] [ 25 ] .

Today, sociology and other social sciences are better contrasted according to methodology
rather than by objects of study. Additionally, unlike sociology, psychology and
anthropology have forensic components that deal with anatomy and other types of laboratory
research.

Sociobiology , is the study of how social behavior and organization has been influenced by
evolution and other biological process . The field blends sociology with a number of other
sciences, such as anthropology , biology , zoology , and others. Although the field once
rapidly gained acceptance, it has remained highly controversial within the sociological
academy. Sociologists often criticize the study for depending too greatly on the effects of
genes in defining behavior. Sociologists often respond by citing a complex relationship
between nature and nurture .

Sociology is also widely used in management science , especially in the field of
organizational behavior as well as in fields such as social work .
