Churches



St. Mark’s Basilica



Image: http://100habits.com/wp-content/uploads/st-Marks-church1.jpg

TheÂ  Patriarchal Cathedral Basilica of Saint Mark Â (officially known inÂ  Italian
Â as theÂ  Basilica Cattedrale Patriarcale di San Marco Â and commonly known asÂ 
Saint Mark’s Basilica ) is theÂ  cathedral Â church of theÂ  Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Venice , northernÂ  Italy .Â It is the most famous of the city’s
churches and one of the best known examples ofÂ  Byzantine architecture .Â It lies at the
eastern end of theÂ  Piazza San Marco , adjacent and connected to theÂ  Doge’s Palace .
Originally it was the chapel of the Doge, and has only been the city’s cathedral since 1807,
when it became the seat of theÂ  Patriarch of Venice , archbishop of theÂ  Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Venice , formerly atÂ  San Pietro di Castello . For its opulent design,
gildedÂ  Byzantine Â  mosaics , and its status as a symbol of Venetian wealth and power,
from the 11th century on the building has been known by the nicknameÂ  Chiesa d’OroÂ 
(Church of gold).

Rick Steves: Â  “Among Europe’s Churches St. Mark’s is Peerless. From the outside,
it’s a riot of domes, columns and statues, completely unlike the towering Gothic churches
of northern Europe or the heavy Baroque of much of the rest of Italy. Inside the decor of Mosaics
colored marbles, and oriental trasures is rarely seen elsewhere. The Christian symbolism is
unfamiliar to western eyes, done in the style of Byzantine icons and even Islamic
design…”

Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari

Franciscan church featuring Renaissance masters



Image: http://100habits.com/wp-content/uploads/Frari-church-venice.jpg

TheÂ  Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari , usually just called theÂ  Frari , is a
church inÂ  Venice , northernÂ  Italy . One of the greatest churches in the city, it has the
status of aÂ  minor basilica . It stands on the Campo dei Frari at the heart of theÂ  San Polo
Â district. The church is dedicated to theÂ  Assumption Â (Italian:Â  Assunzione
della Beata Virgine ). TheÂ  Franciscans Â were granted land to build a church in 1250,
but the building was not completed until 1338. Work almost immediately began on its much
larger replacement, the current church, which took over a century to build. TheÂ 
campanile , the second tallest in the city after that ofÂ  San Marco , was completed in 1396.

The present church was built in a mixture ofÂ  Gothic Â andÂ  Renaissance Â styles
between 1444 and 1515. Antonio Gambello was the original architect, who started the building
in the Gothic style, but the upper part of the facade and the upper parts of the interior were
completed byÂ  Mauro Codussi Â in early Renaissance style.

Architecture / Palaces







DOGE’S PALACE



TheÂ  Doge’s Palace Â ( Italian : Palazzo Ducale) is aÂ  palace Â built inÂ 
Venetian Gothic Â style, and one of the main landmarks of the city of Venice , northernÂ 
Italy . The palace was the residence of theÂ  Doge of Venice , the supreme authority of
theÂ  Republic of Venice , opening as a museum in 1923. Today it is one of the 11 museums run by
theÂ  Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia . InÂ  2010 Â it was visited by 1.358.186
people.



Image: http://100habits.com/wp-content/uploads/doges-palace.jpg

Rick Steves:Â ”The Doge’s Palace houset the fascinaiting government of this rich and
powerful empire. It also served as the home for the Venetian ruler known as the doge
(pronounced: “dohzh”), or duke. For four centuries (ca 1150-1550), this was the most
powerful half-acre in Europe. The rest of Europe marveled at the way Venice could govern
itself without a dominaint king, bishop, or tyrant. The doges wanted their palace to reflect
the wealth and secular values of the Republic, impressing visitors and serving as a reminder
that the Venetians were Number One in Europe.” Cost 14 Euro (combo ticket) Hours Daily

From Rick Steves:Â The 50-plus paintings in Scuola Grande di San Rocco – often called
“Tintoretto’s Sistine Chapel” – present one man’s very personal vision of
christian history. Tintoretto spend the last 20 years of his life working practically for
free on these paintings. …. For Tintoretto fan’s this is the ultimate.





ART



When people admitting their ignorance of art, say, “But I know what I like,” they usually
mean, “I like what I know.”

- Rick Steves (in his book: “Europe 101: History & Art for the Traveler”)

Artists Giovanni Bellini (1430-1516)



Image: http://100habits.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanni_Bellini.jpg Born 1430,
Venice Died 1516 (aged 85-86) Nationality Italian Field Painting Movement Renaissance

Giovanni Bellini Â (c. 1430â€“1516) was anÂ  Italian Â  Renaissance
Â painter, probably the best known of the Bellini family ofÂ  Venetian Â painters.
His father wasÂ  Jacopo Bellini , his brother wasÂ  Gentile Bellini , and his
brother-in-law wasÂ  Andrea Mantegna . He is considered to have revolutionized Venetian
painting, moving it towards a more sensuous and colouristic style. Through the use of clear,
slow-drying oil paints, Giovanni created deep, rich tints and detailed shadings. His
sumptuous coloring and fluent, atmospheric landscapes had a great effect on the Venetian
painting school, especially on his pupilsÂ  Giorgione Â andÂ  Titian .

    Highlights in Venice:

    - TheÂ  San Zaccaria Altarpiece Â (also calledÂ  Madonna Enthroned with Child
    and Saints ), executed in 1505 and located in the church ofÂ  San Zaccaria ,Â  Venice .

    

    - Frari Triptych ( 1488) -Â Oil on panel Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice

    

Titian

Vecelli Born ca. 1488/1490, Pieve di Cadore Died 27 August 1576 (aged 85-88), Venice
Nationality Italian Field Painting Movement High Renaissance Selected Work Assumption of
the Virgin Pesaro Altarpiece Venus of Ubrino Recognized by his contemporaries as “The Sun
Amidst Small Stars” (recalling the famous final line ofÂ  Dante’s Â  Paradiso ),
Titian was one of the most versatile of Italian painters, equally adept with portraits,
landscape backgrounds, and mythological and religious subjects. His painting methods,
particularly in the application and use of color, would exercise a profound influence not
only on painters of the Italian Renaissance, but on future generations ofÂ  Western art
.Â  Tiziano Vecelli Â orÂ  Tiziano Vecellio Â (c. 1488/1490Â â€“ 27
August 1576) was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-centuryÂ 
Venetian school . He was born inÂ  Pieve di Cadore , nearÂ  Belluno Â (inÂ  Veneto ),
in theÂ  Republic of Venice . During his lifetime he was often calledÂ  da Cadore , taken
from the place of his birth.

    Highlights in Venice:

    - Assumption of the Virgin Â is a largeÂ  oil painting Â by Italian Renaissance
    artistÂ  Titian , executed in 1516-1518.Â It is located on the high altar in the
    Basilica ofÂ  Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari Â inÂ  Venice , being the
    largestÂ  altarpiece Â in the city.

    

    - TheÂ  Pesaro Madonna Â ( Italian :Â  Pala Pesaro ) (better known as the Madonna di
    Ca’ Pesaro) is a painting by the Italian Renaissance masterÂ  Titian , commissioned
    byÂ  Jacopo Pesaro , whose family acquired in 1518 the chapel in theÂ  Frari
    Â Basilica inÂ  Venice Â for which the work was painted, and where it remains
    today.

    

    - PietÃ  Â is the last painting by the Italian masterÂ  Titian Â (c. 1575). It is
    housed in theÂ  Gallerie dell’Accademia Â ofÂ  Venice .

Painting Training Giovanni Bellini Movement High Renaissance Selected Works The Tempest,
Sleeping Venus, Castelfranco Madonna & The Three Philosophers Together withÂ  Titian ,
who was slightly younger, he is the founder of the distinctive Venetian school ofÂ  Italian
Renaissance painting , which achieves much of its effect through colour and mood, and is
traditionally contrasted with the reliance on a more linearÂ  disegno Â ofÂ 
Florentine painting .Â  Giorgione Â (bornÂ  Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco ; c.
1477/8 â€“ 1510) was aÂ  Venetian Â painter of theÂ  High Renaissance
Â inÂ  Venice , whose career was cut off by his death at a little over thirty. Giorgione is
known for the elusive poetic quality of his work, though only about six surviving paintings
are acknowledged for certain to be his work. The resulting uncertainty about the identity and
meaning of his art has made Giorgione one of the most mysterious figures in European painting.

    Image: http://100habits.com/wp-content/uploads/giorgione-the-tempest.jpg The
    Tempest Highlights in Venice:

    - The Tempest Â (ItalianÂ  La Tempesta ) is a famousÂ  Renaissance Â painting
    byÂ  Italian Â masterÂ  Giorgione Â dated between 1506 and 1508. Originally
    commissioned by theÂ  Venetian Â noble GabrieleÂ  Vendramin , the painting is
    housed in theÂ  Gallerie dell’Accademia Â ofÂ  Venice ,Â  Italy .

Renaissance Â inÂ  Venice , famous for paintings such asÂ  The Wedding at Cana
