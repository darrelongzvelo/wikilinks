MÃ¡laga ( Spanish pronunciation:Â  [ËˆmalaÉ£a] ; Phoenician :
×žÖ·×œÖ·×—Ö·×”, Malaáž¥a ) is a city and a municipality in the
Autonomous Community of Andalusia , Spain. With a population of 568,507 in 2010, it is the
second most populous city of Andalusia and the fifth largest in Spain. This is the
southernmost large city in Europe. It lies on the Costa del Sol ( Coast of the Sun ) of the
Mediterranean, about 100Â km (62.14Â  mi ) east of the Strait of Gibraltar and about
130Â km (80.78Â  mi ) north of Africa.

MÃ¡laga enjoys a subtropical â€“ mediterranean climate. It has one of the warmest
winters in Europe, with average temperatures of 17 Â°C (62.6Â Â°F) during the day and
7â€“8 Â°C (45â€“46Â Â°F) at night in the period from December through
February. The summer season lasts about eight months, from April through November, although
in the remaining four months temperatures sometimes reach around 20 Â°C (68.0Â Â°F).

MÃ¡laga’s history spans about 2,800 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world
. It was founded by the Phoenicians as Malaka about 770 BC, and from the 6th century BC was under
the hegemony of Ancient Carthage . Then from 218 BC it was ruled by the Roman Republic and later
the Roman Empire as Malaca ( Latin ). After the fall of the empire it was under Islamic Arab
domination as MÄ�laqah ( Ù…Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø© ) for 800 years, but in 1487 it came
under the dominion of the Spaniards in the Reconquista . The archaeological remains and
monuments from the Phoenician, Roman, Arabic and Christian eras make the historic center of
the city an “open museum”, displaying its rich history of more than 3,000 years.

This important cultural infrastructure and the rich artistic heritage have culminated in
the nomination of MÃ¡laga as a candidate for the 2016 European Capital of Culture .

The internationally acclaimed painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso and actor Antonio
Banderas were born in MÃ¡laga. The magnum opus of Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona, “
MalagueÃ±a “, is named for the music of this region of Spain.

The most important business sectors in MÃ¡laga are tourism, construction and technology
services, but other sectors such as transportation and logistics are beginning to expand.
The Andalusia Technology Park (PTA) , located in MÃ¡laga, has enjoyed significant growth
since its inauguration in 1992. As of 2009, this high-tech, science and industrial park is
home to 509 companies and employs over 13,600 people.

La malagueÃ±a (1919) by Julio Romero de Torres .

The Phoenicians from Tyre founded the city as Malaka about 770 BC. The name Malaka or mlk is
probably derived from the Phoenician word for “salt” because fish was salted near the
harbour. (Cf. “ salt ” in other Semitic languages , e.g. Hebrew ×ž×œ×—
mÃ©laáž¥ or Arabic Ù…Ù„Ø­ malaáž¥ ).

After a period of Carthaginian rule, Malaka became part of the Roman Empire . In its Roman
stage, the city (Latin name, Malaca) showed a remarkable degree of development. Transformed
into a confederated city, it was under a special law, the Lex Flavia Malacitana . A Roman
theatre was built at this time. [2] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , it was ruled
first by the Visigoths and then by the Byzantine Empire (550-621).

In the 8th century, during the Muslim Arabic rule over Spain, the city became an important
trade center. MÃ¡laga was first a possession of the Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba . After the fall
of the Umayyad dynasty, it became the capital of a distinct kingdom ruled by the Zirids . During
this time, the city was called MÄ�laqah ( Arabic Ù…Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø© ). From 1025 it
was the capital of the autonomous Taifa of MÃ¡laga , until its conquest by the Taifa of
Granada in 1057.

The traveller Ibn Battuta , who passed through around 1325, characterised it as “one of the
largest and most beautiful towns of Andalusia [uniting] the conveniences of both sea and
land, and is abundantly supplied with foodstuffs and fruits”. He praised its grapes, figs,
and almonds; “its ruby-coloured Murcian pomegranates have no equal in the world.”
Another exported product was its “excellent gilded pottery”. The town’s mosque was
large and beautiful, with “exceptionally tall orange trees” in its courtyard. [3]

MÃ¡laga was one of the Iberian cities where Muslim rule persisted the longest, having been
part of the Emirate of Granada . While most other parts of the peninsula had already succumbed
to the reconquista , the medieval Christian Spanish struggled to drive the Muslims out.
MÃ¡laga was conquered by Christian forces on 18 August 1487, [4] five years before the fall
of Granada .

On 24 August 1704 the indecisive Battle of Velez-MÃ¡laga , the largest naval battle in the
War of the Spanish Succession , took place in the sea south of MÃ¡laga.

MÃ¡laga had a period of rapid development in the 19th century, becoming with Barcelona one
of the two most industrialized cities of Spain. But that early industry was gradually
dismantled, because the successive national governments were supporting the industrial
centers in the north of the country.

MÃ¡laga suffered heavy bombing by Nationalist or Republican air forces and naval units
during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The well-known British journalist and writer Arthur
Koestler was captured by the Nationalist forces on their entry into MÃ¡laga, which formed
the material for his book Spanish Testament . The first chapters of Spanish Testament include
an eye-witness account of the 1937 fall of MÃ¡laga to Francisco Franco ‘s armies during
the Spanish Civil War . After the war, MÃ¡laga and Koestler’s old haunts of Torremolinos
and the rest of the Costa del Sol enjoyed the highest growth of the tourism sector in Spain.

MÃ¡laga is located in southern Spain, on the Costa del Sol ( Coast of the Sun ) on the northern
side of the Mediterranean Sea. It lies about 100Â km east of the Strait of Gibraltar and
about 130Â km east of Tarifa (the southernmost point of continental Europe) and about
130Â km on north of Africa. Lies on a similar latitude (36Â°N) as Algiers in Algeria ,
Tunis in Tunisia , Aleppo in Syria , Mosul in Iraq , Tehran in Iran , Kunduz in Afghanistan and
Fresno, California in the United States.

Metropolitan area



MÃ¡laga, together with the following adjacent towns and municipalities: RincÃ³n de la
Victoria , Torremolinos , BenalmÃ¡dena , Fuengirola , AlhaurÃ­n de la Torre , Mijas ,
Marbella y San Pedro AlcÃ¡ntara form the urban area with a population of 1,066,532 on
827.33Â kmÂ² (density 1,289 hab / kmÂ²) â€“ 2012 data. The urban area stretches
mostly along a narrow strip of coastline. The MÃ¡laga metropolitan area includes
additional municipalities located mostly in the mountains area north of the coast and also
some on the coast: CÃ¡rtama , Pizarra , CoÃ­n , Monda , OjÃ©n , AlhaurÃ­n el Grande and
Estepona on west; Casabermeja on north; TotalÃ¡n , Algarrobo , Torrox and
VÃ©lez-MÃ¡laga eastward from MÃ¡laga.

Victoria , Torremolinos , BenalmÃ¡dena , Fuengirola , Marbella â€“ density
>1000/kmÂ² and Mijas , AlhaurÃ­n de la Torre ).

Municipalities of the metropolitan area are connected by the road network (including
motorways) with the urban area and MÃ¡laga city (the urban area can be reached by car from the
farthest reaches in 20 minutes and MÃ¡laga city in 45 minutes). In some usages the
metropolitan area includes other municipalities to which MÃ¡laga’s public
transportation network extends, at least since the establishment of the Consorcio de
Transporte Metropolitano del Ã�rea de MÃ¡laga (en: Consortium of Transportation of
MÃ¡laga Metropolitan Area ). Together about 1.3 million (max. to 1.5 million) people live
in the MÃ¡laga metropolitan area and the number grows every year as all the municipalities
and cities of the area record an annual increase in population.

Climate



The climate is Subtropical â€“ Mediterranean ( KÃ¶ppen climate classification : Csa
) [5] with very mild winters and warm to hot summers. MÃ¡laga enjoys plenty of sunshine
throughout the year, with an average of about 300 days of sunshine and only about 50 days with
precipitation annually. Its coastal location with winds blowing from the Mediterranean Sea
make the heat manageable during the summer. [6]

MÃ¡laga experiences the warmest winters of any European city with a population over
500,000 and over 100,000 jointly with two other cities in Spain: AlmerÃ­a and Alicante . The
average temperature during the day in the period December through February is 17â€“18
Â°C (63â€“64Â Â°F). During the winter, the MÃ¡laga Mountains ( Montes de
MÃ¡laga ) block out the cold weather from the north. [6] Generally, the summer season lasts
about eight months, from April to November, although in the remaining four months
temperatures sometimes reach around 20 Â°C (68Â Â°F). Its average annual
temperature is 23 Â°C (73Â Â°F) during the day (one of the highest in Europe) and 13
Â°C (55Â Â°F) at night. In the coldest month, January, the temperature ranges from 12
to 20 Â°C (54Â to 68Â Â°F) during the day, 4 to 13 Â°C (39Â to 55Â Â°F) at
night and the average sea temperature is 15â€“16 Â°C (59â€“61Â Â°F). In
the warmest month, August, the temperature ranges from 26 to 32 Â°C (79Â to 90Â Â°F)
during the day (it can rarely be higher), above 20 Â°C (68Â Â°F) at night and the average
sea temperature is 23 Â°C (73Â Â°F).

Large fluctuations in temperature are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded during
the day in the city centre is 43.3 Â°C (109.9Â Â°F) on 13 August 1881. In the month of
August 1881, the average reported daytime maximum temperature was a record 34.8 Â°C
(94.6Â Â°F). The coldest temperature ever recorded was âˆ’0.9 Â°C
(30.4Â Â°F) on the night (the same as tropical Miami ) of 19 January 1891. The highest wind
speed ever recorded was on 16 July 1980, measuring 119Â km/h (73.94Â mph). MÃ¡laga
city has never recorded any snow. [7]

Annual average relative humidity is 66%, ranging from 59% in June to 73% in December. [8]
Yearly sunshine hours is between 2,800 and 3,000 per year, from 5â€“6 hours of sunshine /
day in December to average 11 hours of sunshine / day in July. [8] [9] [10] This is one of the
highest results in Europe and almost double more that of cities in the northern half of Europe
(for comparison: London â€“ 1,461, Warsaw â€“ 1,571, Paris â€“ 1,630).
According to the Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica , 2007 saw 3,059 hours of sunshine.
[11] Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry. MÃ¡laga is one of the few
cities in Europe which are “green” all year round. [ hide ]Climate data for MÃ¡laga

The Cathedral of the Encarnation.

The old historic center of MÃ¡laga reaches the harbour to the south and is surrounded by
mountains to the north, the Montes de MÃ¡laga (part of Baetic Cordillera ), lying in the
southern base of the AxarquÃ­a hills, and two rivers, the Guadalmedina â€“ the
historic center is located on its left bank â€“ and the Guadalhorce , which flows west of
the city into the Mediterranean.

The oldest architectural remains in the city are the walls of the Phoenician city, which are
visible in the basement of the Picasso Museum.

The Roman theater of MÃ¡laga, which dates from the 1st century BC, was fortuitously
rediscovered in 1951.

The Moors left posterity the dominating presence of the Castle of Gibralfaro , which is
connected to the Alcazaba , the lower fortress and royal residence. Both were built during the
Taifa period (11th century) and extended during the Nasrid period (13th and 14th centuries).
The Alcazaba stands on a hill within the city. Originally, it defended the city from the
incursions of pirates. Later, in the mid-11th century, it was completely rebuilt by the
Hammudid dynasty. Occupying the eastern hillside that rises from the sea and overlooks the
city, the Alcazaba was surrounded by palms and pine trees.

La ConcepciÃ³n, botanical and historical garden.

Like many of the military fortifications that were constructed in Islamic Spain, the
Alcazaba of MÃ¡laga featured a quadrangular plan. It was protected by an outer and inner
wall, both supported by rectangular towers, between which a covered walkway led up the slope
to the Gibralfaro (this was the only exchange between the two sites). Due to its rough and
awkward hillside topography, corridors throughout the site provided a means of
communications for administrative and defensive operations, also affording privacy to the
palatial residential quarters.

The entrance of the complex featured a grand tower that led into a sophisticated double bent
entrance. After passing through several gates, open yards with beautiful gardens of pine and
eucalyptus trees, and the inner wall through the Puerta de Granada, one finds the 11th and 14th
century Governor’s palace. It was organized around a central rectangular courtyard with a
triple-arched gateway and some of the rooms have been preserved to this day. An open 11th
century mirador (belvedere) to the south of this area affords views of the gardens and sea
below. Measuring 2.5 square meters, this small structure highlighted scalloped,
five-lobed arches. To the north of this area were a waterwheel and a Cyclopean well
(penetrating forty meters below ground), a hammam, workshops and the monumental Puerta de la
Torre del Homenaje , the northernmost point of the inner walls. Directly beyond was the
passage to the Gibralfaro above.

The Church of Santiago ( Saint James ) is an example of Gothic vernacular MudÃ©jar , the
hybrid style that evolved after the Reconquista incorporating elements from both Christian
and Islamic tradition. Also from the period is the Iglesia del Sagrario , which was built on the
site of the old mosque immediately after the city fell to Christian troops. It boasts a richly
ornamented portal in the Isabeline-Gothic style, unique in the city.

The Cathedral and the Episcopal Palace were planned with Renaissance architectural ideals
but there was a shortfall of building funds and they were finished in Baroque style.

The BasÃ­lica y Real Santuario de Santa MarÃ­a de la Victoria , built in the late 17th
century, has a chapel in which the vertical volume is filled with elaborate Baroque
plasterwork.

Trade Fair and Congress in MÃ¡laga ( Palacio de Ferias y Congresos de MÃ¡laga ).

 

MÃ¡laga is the fourth-ranking city in economic activity in Spain behind Madrid , Barcelona
and Valencia . [16]

The most important business sectors in MÃ¡laga are tourism, construction and technology
services, but other sectors such as transportation and logistics are beginning to expand.
The Andalusia Technology Park (PTA) (In Spanish, “ Parque TecnolÃ³gico de AndalucÃ­a
“), located in MÃ¡laga, has enjoyed significant growth since its inauguration in 1992 by
the King of Spain . As of 2010, this high-tech, science and industrial park is home to 509
companies and employs over 14,500 people.

In line with the city’s strategic plan, the campaign “MÃ¡laga: Open for Business” is
directed towards the international promotion of the city on all levels but fundamentally on a
business level. The campaign places a special emphasis on new technologies as well as
innovation and research in order to promote the city as a reference and focal point for many
global business initiatives and projects. [17]

MÃ¡laga is a city of commerce and tourism has been a growing source of revenue, driven by the
presence of a major airport, the improvement of communications, and new infrastructure such
as the AVE and the maritime station, and new cultural facilities such as the Picasso Museum,
the Contemporary Art Center and Trade Fair and Congress, which have drawn more tourists. [18]

The city hosts the International Association of Science and Technology Parks (IASP) (
AsociaciÃ³n Internacional de Parques TecnolÃ³gicos ), and a group of IT company
executives and business leaders has launched an information sector initiative, MÃ¡laga
Valley e-27 , which seeks to make MÃ¡laga the Silicon Valley of Europe. MÃ¡laga has had
strong growth in new technology industries, mainly located in the Technological Park of
Andalusia, and in the construction sector. The city is home to the largest bank in Andalusia,
Unicaja , and such local companies as Mayoral , Charanga , Sando , Vera , Ubago , Isofoton ,
Tedial , Novasoft , Grupo VÃ©rtice and Almeida viajes , and other multinationals such as
Fujitsu Spain, Pernod Ricard Spain, Accenture , Epcos , Oracle Corporation , Huawei and San
Miguel . [19] Distribution by sector industrial enterprises: [20] Industrial sector

Holy week in MÃ¡laga.

Annual cultural events



The Holy Week celebration, the August MÃ¡laga Fair ( Feria de MÃ¡laga ) and the MÃ¡laga
Film Festival are the three major events held in the city.

The Holy Week of MÃ¡laga has been observed for some five centuries. Processions start on
Palm Sunday and continue until Easter Sunday. Images depicting scenes from the Passion are
displayed on huge ornate tronos (floats or thrones), some weighing more than 5,000 kilos and
carried by more than 250 members of the fraternity of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la Esperanza . These
tronos highlight the processions that go through the streets led by penitents dressed in long
purple robes, often with pointed hats, followed by women in black carrying candles. Drums and
trumpets play music and occasionally someone spontaneously sings a mournful saeta
dedicated to the floats as they make their way slowly round the streets.

August MÃ¡laga Fair .

Some Holy Week tronos are so huge that they must be housed in places outside the churches, as
they are taller than the entrance doors. There are also military parades of soldiers playing
processional band marches or singing their anthems along the route.

During the celebration of the Feria de MÃ¡laga in August, the streets are transformed into
traditional symbols of Spanish culture and history, with sweet wine, tapas, and live
flamenco shows. The day events consist of dancing, live music (like Flamenco or Verdiales ,
traditional music from MÃ¡laga) and bullfights at La Malagueta , while the night fair is
moved to the Recinto Ferial, consisting of restaurants, clubs, and an entire fair ground with
rides and games.

The MÃ¡laga Film Festival ( Festival de MÃ¡laga Cine EspaÃ±ol (FMCE) ) is the most
important festival dedicated exclusively to cinema made in Spain. It is held annually during
a week in April.

Religion



Most of the population of MÃ¡laga professes Roman Catholicism as its religion. Islam is
represented by a growing number of immigrants and a newly-constructed mosque.

The Evangelicals also have a presence in MÃ¡laga, and The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints is growing. The Jewish Community in MÃ¡laga is represented by its
synagogue and the Jewish Association.

Strachan Street in downtown.

The city is an important tourist destination, known as “the capital of the Costa del Sol”.
Tourists usually visit the birthplace of Pablo Picasso and the Museo Picasso MÃ¡laga , the
Carmen Thyssen Museum, the old town or the beaches. The MÃ¡laga harbour is also the second
busiest cruise port of the Iberian Peninsula.

A popular walk leads up the hill to the Gibralfaro castle (a Parador ), offering panoramic
views over the city. The castle is next to the Alcazaba , the old Muslim palace, which in turn is
next to the inner city of MÃ¡laga. Other nearby attractions are the Roman Theatre, the old
Jewish quarter, the Cathedral, and the Church of Santiago in mudÃ©jar style . A popular walk
follows the Paseo del Parque (a promenade that runs alongside a grand park with many palm trees
and statues) to the harbour, ending in Calle Larios , the main commercial street of the city.
There is also a curious museum, the Museum of the Holy Week, which includes an impressive
display of Baroque ecclesiastical items.

Beaches in the Costa del Sol.

The Costa del Sol ( Spanish pronunciation:Â  [Ëˆkosta Ã°el sol] ; “Sunny Coast” or
more literally, “Coast of the Sun”) is a region in the south of Spain, in the autonomous
community of Andalusia , comprising the coastal towns and communities along the
Mediterranean coastline of the Province of MÃ¡laga . The Costa del Sol is situated between
two lesser known costas: Costa de la Luz and Costa Tropical . Formerly made up only of a series of
small, quiet fishing settlements, the region has been completely transformed during the
latter part of the 20th century into a tourist destination of world renown.

It includes the city of MÃ¡laga and the towns of Torremolinos , BenalmÃ¡dena , Fuengirola
, Mijas , Marbella , San Pedro de AlcÃ¡ntara , Estepona , Manilva , Casares , RincÃ³n de la
Victoria , VÃ©lez-MÃ¡laga , Nerja , Frigiliana and Torrox . The Costa del Sol extends from
the cliffs at Maro in the East to Punto Chullera in the west. Settlement in the region dates back
to the Bronze Age , and has been colonised and ruled by many cultures such as the Phoenicians ,
Greeks , Carthaginians , Romans , Vandals , Visigoths and Moors , before the Reconquista .

Historically its population lived in the fishing villages, and in the “white” villages a
little distance inland, in the mountains running down to the coast. The area was discovered
and developed to meet the demands of international tourism in the 1950s and has since been a
popular destination for foreign tourists not only for its beaches but also for its local
culture. The area is particularly famous for its towns like Marbella , which provides the
Costa del Sol with its reputation for being a playground for its super-rich and famous
visitors.

During the late 1970s and 1980s, the region was also known in the United Kingdom as the “Costa
del Crime”, due to the trend for British gangsters to escape from legal trouble at home by
moving there to live their lives in luxury. Due to tense relations between the two nations over
Gibraltar , extradition between the two countries was not followed. This phenomenon has been
alluded to in television shows such as Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and in the more recent films Sexy
Beast and The Business .

The Costa del Sol is a popular tourist region that welcomes millions of people annually, who
mostly arrive at MÃ¡laga Airport and head to one of the many resorts located along this
stretch of coastline from Manilva in the west to Nerja in the east.

The Costa del Sol is also known as “La Costa del Golf” (The Golf Coast). It contains the
largest concentration of golf courses in Andalusia and of the European continent, which are
distributed in the following way: 21 in Marbella , 11 inÂ  Mijas , 10 inÂ  Estepona , 6
inÂ  BenahavÃ­s and San Roque , 3 inÂ  MÃ¡laga , 2 inÂ  Casares ,Â  RincÃ³n de la

,Â  La LÃ­nea de la ConcepciÃ³n and Manilva . To all of these we have to add all the
existing ones located in the interior areas as AlhaurÃ­n el Grande ,Â  AlhaurÃ­n de la
Torre and Antequera. 15

 

Sierra Nevada (Spain)



The Sierra Nevada (meaning “snowy range” in Spanish ) is a mountain range in the region of
Andalusia , provinces of Granada and AlmerÃ­a in Spain . It contains the highest point of
continental Spain, MulhacÃ©n at 3478Â m (11,411Â ft.) above sea level .

It is a popular tourist destination, as its high peaks make skiing possible in one of
Europe’s most southerly ski resorts , in an area along the Mediterranean Sea predominantly
known for its warm temperatures and abundant sunshine. At its foothills is found the city of
Granada and, a little further, AlmerÃ­a and MÃ¡laga .

Parts of the range have been included in the Sierra Nevada National Park . The range has also
been declared a biosphere reserve . The Sierra Nevada Observatory is located on the northern
slopes at an elevation of 2800Â m (9186Â ft.).

Formation



The Sierra Nevada was formed during the Alpine Orogeny , a mountain-building event that also
formed the European Alps to the east and the Atlas Mountains of northern Africa across the
Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Sierra as observed today formed during the Tertiary
Period (65 to 1.8 million years ago) from the collision of the African and Eurasian
continental plates .

Geography



Central to the mountain range is a ridge running broadly west-south-west –
east-north-east. For a substantial distance, the watershed stays consistently above
3000Â m (9842Â ft.).

On the southern side of the range, several long but narrow river valleys lead off towards the
south-west, separated by a number of subsidiary ridges.

On the steeper and craggier northern side, the valleys have less regular orientations. This
side is dominated by the Rio Genil which starts near MulhacÃ©n and into which many of the
other rivers flow.

Description



Sierra Nevada is Europeâ€™s southernmost ski station , [3] and the highest in Spain. [4]
With its high elevation , the skiing season can last from late November until early May.
Particularly towards the end of the season you can enjoy long, sunny days of skiing, although
wind can be a problem due to Veleta’s prominence and few trees. The resort is situated
27Â km (17Â mi.) from the city of Granada , and is accessed by the A-395. It is also less
than 100Â km from Motril , on the Costa Tropical , which means skiing and swimming on the same
day is an option. Nearest bigger city is Malaga , is accessed by the highway A-7 / European route
E15 (Malaga-Motril), highway A-7 / European route E902 (Motril-Granada) and then route
Granada-Sierra Nevada Ski Station.

At the foot of the slopes there is a resort village, Pradollano, which stretches up a hill to the
north of the pistes. The bottom of the village is at about 2100 meters above sea level , while the
top is at almost 2400 meters above sea level. Pradollano is home to a large number of shops,
including many that sell or rent ski equipment, souvenir shops and a small supermarket. There
are also a variety of ski schools, restaurants, cafÃ©s, bars and nightclubs.

The mid-station Borreguiles, which is served by two cable cars that run from the bottom of
Pradollano, is at 2675 m (8776Â ft). Here there are a few cafÃ©s and restaurants, a ski
school , a few hire shops and lockers.

The resort is run by a private-public enterprise called Cetursa Sierra Nevada, S.A. .

Activities



By far the main attraction for visitors to the resort is the 100Â km (62Â mi.) of alpine
skiing runs. With abundant snow, it is possible to ski almost anywhere on the mountain, as the
whole resort is above the tree line. It should be noted that the resort does not carry out
avalanche blasting, and skiers are generally advised against leaving the pistes due to
avalanche risk. As the resort mainly caters to locals, and less to people visiting for a whole
week, it is much busier at weekends. There are rarely any queues mid-week outside the main
Spanish holidays (first week of December, Christmas through to 6 January and Easter). Even at
weekends, queues are generally fairly short if the whole resort is open, allowing skiers to
spread out across the mountain.

In recent years the resort has made an effort to increase the number of services it offers,
including expanding the Mirlo Blanco recreation zone, which now has an ice rink, toboggans,
ski-bikes, mini-skis and a track for wheeled toboggans.

In summer you can go walking, cycling, horse-riding and mountain climbing in the area. One of
the cable cars and one chair-lift are kept open in July and August, making it relatively easy
for hikers to reach the summit of Veleta. On a clear day, you may be lucky enough to catch a
glimpse of Africa from the peak of the mountain.

Also during the summer months, the National Parks office runs a microbus service from Hoya de
la Mora, just above the resort village, to Posiciones del Veleta, at 3,100 metres. The service
includes a guided commentary about the geology and ecology of the Sierra Nevada. [5]

Communications



A bus service connects the resort to the main bus station in the city of Granada, with the
journey taking approximately 45 minutes. The bus station is on Avenida de Juan Pablo II.
During the skiing season, weekday buses run from the bus station to the resort at 08:00, 10:00
and 17:00, returning at 09:00, 16:00 and 18:30. At weekends and on public holidays they leave
Granada at 08:00, 10:00, 15:00 and 17:00, and return at 09:00, 13:00, 16:00 and 18:30. Outside
the skiing season, there is a daily bus to the resort at 09:00, while the bus back down leaves at
17:00. [6]

There is also a microbus service that shuttles between the bottom and top of Pradollano, as
well as a chair-lift suitable for non-skiers that connects the bottom, middle and top of the
village.

Geography



There are more than 20 peaks over 3,000 meters, with the highest being MulhacÃ©n (3479 m),
[2] Veleta (3396 m) [3] and Alcazaba (3371 m). The rivers that rise on the north face of the range
feed the Guadalquivir basin, the most important ones being the Fardes and Genil . Meanwhile,
the rivers that rise on the west and south faces run down into the Mediterranean. These include
the DÃºrcal, Ã�zbor, TrevÃ©lez and Poqueira, which are all tributaries of the
Guadalfeo , which itself rises in the Sierra Nevada, and the Adra and Andarax, with their
tributaries. The south and west faces are where you will find the majority of the almost 50
high-mountain lakes that exist in the Sierra Nevada, many of which are also the sources of
streams and rivers. Much of the landscape, particularly above 2,400 metres (which was the
perpetual snow line prior to the Holocene period) was shaped by the action of glaciers,
resulting in characteristic U-shaped valleys.

Fauna and Flora



Due to its isolated location in the far south of Europe, the flora and fauna of the Sierra Nevada
are unique. During the last ice age, species moved south to escape the colder climate in the
north, and as the climate grew warmer again, these species survived by taking refuge in the
mountains. 2,100 plant species have been catalogued in the park, 116 of which are classified
as threatened, [7] and over 60 of which are unique to the area (endemic).

Threatened species include the Artemisia granatensis , a sub-species of the Marsh Gentian
endemic to the Sierra Nevada [8] and the Alpine Meadow-rue . One of the most emblematic plants
of the Sierra Nevada is the Plantago nivalis , also known as the Snow Star.

The park is home to a thriving Spanish ibex population, along with other species such as wild
boar, martens, badgers and wildcats. Native bird species include the Golden Eagle,
Bonelliâ€™s Eagle, Common Kestrel, Little Owl, Eurasian Eagle-owl, European
Goldfinch, Serin, Ortolan, Dartford Warbler, Wheateater, Red-legged Partridge and Common
Quail.

On the edge of the park lies the Botanic Garden of Cortijuela , where the endemic species of the
Sierra are investigated and preserved.

Activities

    

    - Skiing:

    



    The Sierra Nevada Ski Station , which hosted the Alpine World Ski Championships in 1996,
    is Europe’s southernmost ski resort. Nevertheless, thanks to its high altitude, the
    skiing season can last from late November until the start of May.

    - Hiking:

    



    Popular bases for hiking in the Sierra Nevada include Capileira , TrevÃ©lez , Monachil
    , GÃŒÃ©jar Sierra and BubiÃ³n . It is relatively easy to reach the summits of
    MulhacÃ©n and Veleta, whereas Alcazaba is slightly harder to reach. Dotted around the
    Sierra Nevada there are a number of mountain cabins (“refugios”) designed for the

Map of the old town with its main buildings

























































Old Town (Casco Antiguo)



The old town of Marbella includes the ancient city walls and the two historical suburbs of the
city, the Barrio Alto , which extends north, and the Barrio Nuevo , located to the east. The
ancient walled city retains nearly the same layout as in the sixteenth century. Here is the
Plaza de los Naranjos , an example of Castilian Renaissance design, its plan laid out after the
Christian reconquest in the heart of Old Town. Around the square are arranged three
remarkable buildings: the town hall, built in 1568 by the Catholic Monarchs in Renaissance
style, the Mayor’s house, which combines Gothic and Renaissance elements in its
faÃ§ade, with a roof of Mudejar style and fresco murals inside, and the Chapel of Santiago,
the oldest religious building in the city, built earlier than the square and not aligned with
it, believed to date from the 15th century. Other buildings of interest in the centre are the
Church of Santa MarÃ­a de la EncarnaciÃ³n, built in the Baroque style starting in 1618,
the Casa del Roque , and the remains of the Arabic castle and defensive walls; also in the
Renaissance style are the Capilla de San Juan de Dios (Chapel of St. John of God), the Hospital
Real de la Misericordia (Royal Hospital of Mercy) and the Hospital BazÃ¡n which now houses
the Museum of Contemporary Spanish Engravings.

Ermita del Santo Cristo

One of the highlights of the Barrio Alto is the Ermita del Santo Cristo de la Vera Cruz
(Hermitage of the Holy Christ of the True Cross), built in the fifteenth century and enlarged
in the eighteenth century, which consists of a square tower with a roof covered by glazed
ceramic tiles. The Barrio Alto is also known as the San Francisco neighborhood, after a
Franciscan convent formerly located there. The so-called Nuevo Barrio (New Town),
separated from the walled city by the Arroyo de la Represa , has no monumental buildings but
retains its original layout and much of its character in the simple whitewashed houses with
their tiled roofs and exposed wooden beams, orchards and small corrals.

Historic Eixample

Constitution Park

Between the old town and the sea in the historic area known as Eixample, there is a small
botanical garden on Paseo de la Alameda, and a garden with fountains and a collection of ten
sculptures by Salvador Dali on the Avenida del Mar, which connects the old town with the beach.
To the west of this road, passing the Faro de Marbella, is Constitution Park, which houses the
auditorium of the same name and the Skol Apartments, designed in the Modernist style by the
Spanish architect Manuel JaÃ©n Albaitero.

The Golden Mile of Nueva Andalucia



The Golden Mile is actually a stretch of four miles between Marbella and Puerto BanÃºs, on
which are located some of the most luxurious residences in Marbella, such as the Palace of King
Fahd, as well as some landmark hotels, among them the Melia Don Pepe, the Hotel Marbella Club
and the Puente Romano Hotel.

Nueva AndalucÃ­a is an area that was developed during the tourisism boom of the 1960s, where
may be found the ruins of the Roman villa by the Rio Verde, and El Ã�ngel, where the land of the
old forge works was converted to an agricultural colony, and the Botanical Gardens of El
Ã�ngel with gardens of three different styles, dating from the eighth century.

San Pedro de AlcÃ¡ntara



At the heart of San Pedro de AlcÃ¡ntara are two industrial buildings of the nineteenth
century: the Trapiche de Guadaiza and sugar mill, which now houses the Ingenio Cultural
Center. The nineteenth-century heritage of San Pedro is completed by two buildings of
colonial style, the Church and the Villa of San Luis, residence of the MarquÃ©s del Duero.
Next to San Pedro, near the mouth of the river Guadalmina, are some of the most important
archaeological sites in Marbella: the early Christian Basilica of Vega del Mar, the Roman
baths of the Vaults and the eponymous watch tower of Torre de Las BÃ³vedas . The important
archaeological site of Cerro Colorao is located near Benahavis; it features a complex
chronological sequence that begins in the fourth century BC within a Mastieno (ancient
Iberian ethnicity of the Tartessian confederation) area, then a town identified as Punic and
finally a Roman settlement. A series of domestic structures that correspond to the different
stages of occupation recorded in the sequence of the site characterise the settlement as
being fortified because it is walled.

District of Las Chapas



In the eastern part of the municipality in the district of Las Chapas is the site of Rio Real ,
situated on a promontory near the mouth of the river of the same name. This is a settlement which
may be traced to the eighth century BC and probably is Phoenician since it is close to some old
iron mines. Plates, carinated bowls, lamps and ceramics from Phoenician and indigenous
types, also Greek examples, have been found. There two ancient watchtowers, the Royal River
Tower and the Tower Thieves. Among the notable tourist attractions is the City Residential
Leisure, an architectural ensemble of the Modernist movement, it has been a registered
property of national Cultural Interest since 2006, and the former Hilton Hotel Marbella, now
the Don Carlos Hotel, designed by architect Melvin Villarroel, is of the same style as the
previous.

According to 2003 data, Marbella is amongst the municipalities ranking highest in household
disposable income per capita in Andalusia, second to MojÃ¡car and matched by four other
municipalities, including its neighbor, BenahavÃ­s.

Its business sector consisted of 17,647 establishments in 2005, representing a total of
14.7% of the businesses in Malaga province, and showed greater dynamism than the provincial
capital itself for growth over the period 1998-2004, when it grew 9% compared to the 2.4%
growth rate of MÃ¡laga. Compared to the rest of Andalusia, the volume of production in
Marbella is higher than that of most other municipalities with similar population, ranking
even above the capitals of Almeria, Huelva and Jaen.

Puerto BanÃºs

As in most cities of the Andalusian coast, Marbella’s economy revolves around tertiary
activities. The service sector accounts for 60% of employment, while trade accounts for
almost 20%. The main branches of the service sector are hospitality, real estate and business
services, which fact underscores the importance of tourism in the Marbella economy.
Meanwhile, the construction, industrial and agriculture sectors account for 14.2%, 3.8%
and 2.4% of employment respectively.

The number of business establishments in the service sector accounts for 87.5% of the total,
those in construction account for 9.6%, and in industry, 2.9%. Of these companies, 89.5% have
fewer than 5 employees and only 2.3% have a staff of at least 20 employees.

In 2008 a study by the Institute of Statistics of Andalusia (IEA) based on 14 variables
(income, equipment, training, etc.), found Marbella was the Andalusian city with the best
development of the general welfare and the highest quality of life. According to the results
of the study, Marbella ranks highest in the number of private clinics, sports facilities and
private schools.

Port of Cabopino

Marine shipping



The four ports of Marbella are primarily recreational; although both Puerto BanÃºs and the
Puerto de la Bajadilla are permitted to dock cruise ships, neither operates regular service
to other ports. The port of Bajadilla is also home to the fishermen’s guild of Marbella and is
used for the transport of goods.

Rail



Marbella is the most populous municipality in the Iberian Peninsula without a railway
station in its territory, and is, with Torrevieja, one of the two cities of over 100,000
inhabitants not served by rail.

An infrastructure project is underway for the construction of the Corridor of Costa del Sol
rail system to connect Nerja, MÃ¡laga and Algeciras, possibly to include a high speed
railway, with several stops planned for Marbella. Until then the nearest station is near
Fuengirola, 27Â km distant, further away is MÃ¡laga Maria Zambrano, located in
MÃ¡laga city, 57Â km away, and Ronda Station, also 57Â km.

Intercity bus



Most intercity bus services are operated by CTSA-Portillo, communicating with major urban
centers of the Costa del Sol, including MÃ¡laga and its airport, and nearby towns in the
interior (Benahavis, Ojen, Ronda), as well as the Campo including Gibraltar (La Linea and
Algeciras), some of the major cities of Andalusia (AlmerÃ­a, CÃ¡diz, CÃ³rdoba,
Jerez, Granada, Jaen, Seville and Ãšbeda) and MÃ©rida in Extremadura . The central bus
station has connnections to other domestic destinations, Madrid, and Barcelona, and
international ones as well: Brussels, Amsterdam, Luxembourg , Paris, Zurich and Rabat .

Marbella is not formally integrated into the Metropolitan Transportation Consortium
Malaga area, but the following lines operate in its environs:

Media



Given the ethnic diversity of the city, Marbella’s newspapers and magazines are published
in several European languages, among which are La Tribuna de Marbella (Spanish), Sydkusten
(in Swedish) and Costa del Sol Nachrichten (in German). In addition, Diario Sur (Spanish) or
Southern Journal (in English) and La OpiniÃ³n de MÃ¡laga (Spanish) have editorial
offices in the city. Among the magazines with the largest circulation are those dedicated to
fashion and lifestyle, such as Absolute Marbella , Essential Magazine , The European
Magazine , Transform Magazine (all in English), and Das Aktuelle Spanienmagazin (in
German). Golf Andalusia and Golf Spain magazines , monthly Spanish-English bilingual
magazines with a total circulation of 45,000 copies, are distributed throughout Spain.

Marbella has several local television stations, such as M95 Television, Summer TV and South
Coast Television, and several digital news dailies including the Voice of Marbella and
Journal of Marbella.

‘ Puerto BanÃºs ‘ is one of the main touristic sites of Marbella.

The short story SoÃ±ar un Crimen is set in Marbella. It details one of the infamous murders
that occurred in the city.

Marbella was featured in the popular political thriller, Syriana . It was used as the location
for a private party which an Arabian Emir hosts. Marbella was portrayed as an extremely
affluent city with most cars at the entrance of the palace being very expensive. In the same
year it appeared in Steven Spielberg ‘s Munich in a very similar context.

In 2006, there was an international advertisement advertising Marbella as a tourist
destination. The song on the advert is aptly called Marbella and is performed by singer
Cristie .

Torrente 2: MisiÃ³n en Marbella and the Finnish 1985 comedy film Uuno Epsanjassa is
situated in Marbella.

Many other movies and TV programmes such as Nip/Tuck portray it as a playground for the rich.

ITV aired a TV programme in spring 2007 called Marbella Belles which portrays a series of
British women who now live in Marbella with their rich partners.

Cast of Living On The Edge visit on the fourth episode of the first season.

It is also referenced in the stage play “ Noises Off ” by Michael Frayn. The character
Phillip and his wife Belinda have been tax exiles in Spain. The character Gary thinks he and his
guest are alone in the house, when he spots Phillip, and thinks he’s a ghost. Gary: “Hold on
a second, you’re not from the other world!” Phillip: “Yes, yes, Marbella!”

Carlos Baute ‘s song “ Colgando en tus Manos ” mentions him and his love vacationing in
Marbella and Marta Sanchez sings this line in their duet version of the song.

History



The architect Noldi Schreck , who participated in the design and construction of Beverly
Hills , was visited in 1966 by Prince Alfonso de Hohenlohe to ask him to work on the Hotel
Marbella Club . Schreck’s first job was to meet JosÃ© BanÃºs (a close friend of
Francisco Franco ), and convince him that Puerto BanÃºs was not a suitable place to build
huge skyscrapers that would house thousands of wealthy families. [5] He proposed a
sophisticated Andalusian village and marina, the first port made by a single architect.
JosÃ© BanÃºs became the largest developer of residential tourism complexes on the Costa
del Sol. The port took his name and he became famous with the epithet “the regimeâ€™s
builder.” [3]

Beach of Puerto BanÃºs

The lavish opening of the complex in May 1970 was attended by, amongst others, the Aga Khan ,
film director Roman Polanski , Playboy founder Hugh Hefner , Dr. Christiaan Barnard (pioneer
of the heart transplant), and Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco . A young Julio
Iglesias was hired to sing for the guests for the sum of 125,000 pesetas. [3] Three hundred
waiters from Seville served 22 kilos of beluga caviar to 1700 guests.

In 2011, it was reported that one of the largest-scale developments in Marbella’s history
was to take place with a 400 million euro investment into La Bajadilla , east of Marbella, by
Qatari Sheikh Abdullah Ben Nasser Al-Thani which included 200 metres (660Â ft) quay for
cruise liners, a five-star hotel on the marina, as well as bars, restaurants, shops and
supermarkets to compete with Puerto BanÃºs. [6]

DalÃ­’s Rhinoceros (weight 3.6 tonnes)

Culture



A three-ton statue of a rhinoceros by Salvador DalÃ­ was placed in Puerto BanÃºs in 2004.
Officially known as Rinoceronte vestido con puntillas (“ Rhinoceros dressed in lace “),
DalÃ­ created the sculpture in 1956 following the filming of his surrealist movie La
aventura prodigiosa de la encajera y el rinoceronte (“The prodigious adventure of the
lacemaker and the rhinoceros”) in 1954. [3] [11] Another impressive statue sculpted in
bronze and copper by the Georgian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli is that of “La Victoria”,
which stands tall at 26 metres (85Â ft) height over a granite pedestal. Unveiled in 1994, it
was a gift from the Mayor of Moscow . [3] [11]

History



Nerja has a long history, evidenced by the primitive paintings found in its famous Nerja caves
, discovered in 1959. These caves are now believed to be just one entrance to a linked series of
potholes stretching many miles into the mountains between Nerja and Granada, and which may
yet prove to be one of the most extensive unexplored systems in Europe . Visitors to the caves
will be able to view the remains of one of the ancient inhabitants of Nerja.

The Romans built here three settlements, including Detunda , of which now large remains can be
seen. The area was later taken over by the Arabs in the early 8th century. Under the Moors , the
town was known as Narixa , which means “abundant spring”, from which the present name
derives.

Tour into of the BalcÃ³n de Europa.

The BalcÃ³n de Europa , a mirador or viewpoint which gives stunning views across the sea, is
in the centre of the old town. Its name is popularly believed to have been coined by King Alfonso
XII , who visited the area in 1885 following a disastrous earthquake and was captivated by the
scene. Local folklore says that he stood upon the site where the BalcÃ³n now stands, and said
“This is the balcony of Europe”. Local archive documents are said to show that its name
predated this visit, but this has not prevented the authorities from placing a life-sized
(and much photographed) statue of the king standing by the railing.

The BalcÃ³n area was originally known as La BaterÃ­a, a reference to the gun battery which
existed there in a fortified tower. This emplacement and a similar tower nearby were
destroyed during the Peninsular War . In May 1812, the British vessels Hyacinth , Termagant
and Basilisk supported Spanish guerrillas on t

he coast of Granada, against the French. On 20 May, Termangant or Hyacinth opened fire and the
forts were destroyed. Two rusty guns positioned at the end of the BalcÃ³n are reminders of
these violent times. The huge lumps of rock, the remains of La BaterÃ­a, visible in the sea at
the end of the BalcÃ³n, are further evidence of this action.

Modern Nerja



In more modern times, sugar cane production has given way to more valuable cash crops,
particularly semi-tropical fruits such as mango and papaya and widespread avocado
plantations in what is one of the major avocado growing regions in Europe. The sugar cane
factory is still on the eastern edge of town, but is now empty.

It is the eastern-most town in the area known as the AxarquÃ­a and has an official population
of around 22,000 (in 2008) â€” nearly 30% of which are foreign residents, including
around 2,600 British â€” although the true expatriate population is probably at least
twice that. In the summer months, tourism swells the population several times more. The
streets are narrow, some one way and some are pedestrians only. Cars line many streets and
there are two main car parks to take the overflow.

The town is situated on a fairly steep hill. It has several beaches set in coves beneath cliffs.
It is also becoming a significant centre for walkers, thanks to the mountain scen

ery of the nearby Sierra de Almijara and Sierra Tejeda . The Sierra de Burno overlooks the town.
Nerja is also the centre of scuba diving on the Costa del Sol, with the Natural Park

of Maro – Cerro Gordo nearby.

The town has five supermarkets, a Lidl and many mini-marts spread around town. Nerja does not
have any large stores of the main chains of shops in Spain. Nerja has a small exhibition hall in
the High Street and February or March there is a parade of bicycles which attracts a few
thousand cyclists, including people of all ages. Also a Carnival parades through the town
with people lining the streets.

Public transport



Nerja is not integrated in the MÃ¡laga Metropolitan Transport Consortium .

As well as two local bus routes, around town (from the RiÃº MÃ³nica Hotel), there are buses
from the top of the High Street by the Alsa ticket office to MÃ¡laga , Caves of Nerja ,
Frigiliana , Maro , AlmuÃ±Ã©car , VÃ©lez-MÃ¡laga , Torre del Mar , Granada ,
CÃ³rdoba , Seville , AlmerÃ­a , Motril , and certain months, direct buses to and from
MÃ¡laga airport.

Nerja has been a source of inspiration for expatriate writers and artists, such as Scottish
novelist Joan Lingard and French-born author AndrÃ© Launay ; Jorge GuillÃ©n and
Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca were longtime visitors and residents of the town. [ citation needed
] The town was also the main setting for the filming of Verano azul , a popular Spanish
television series later exported to several countries. [ citation needed ]

History



Founded in prehistoric times by the Tertessians , it was known as Tamisa by the Romans ; later
the name changed to Mixa and finally to the current Mijas. The Romans were replaced by the
Visigoths , and then, after 714, by the Moors .

At the time of emirate of CÃ³rdoba , it was conquered by Umar ibn Hafsun , remaining under the
rule of Bobastro until the latter was defeated by Abd al-Rahman III .

In 1487 Mijas resisted to the attacks of the Catholic Monarchs during the siege of MÃ¡laga;
later the inhabitants surrendered and were most sold as slaves. During the Revolt of the
Comuneros it remained loyal to the Spanish crown, which granted Mijas the title of ‘ Muy Leal
(“Very Loyal”).

Mijas was a village belonging to Turdenisia, founded next to the fortification which remains
are still in the actual â€œplateau of the wallâ€�. Phoenicians and Greeks passed
through here, attracted by the minerals and metals abounded in the area, as was evidence by
Ptolemyâ€™s and his Geography at II century Romans, called it Tamisa and remained an
important trade, helped with the construction of â€œVia Apiaâ€� way that linked
MÃ¡laga and Cadiz. First terraces and grapes planting are attributed to the romans. The
Visigoths replaced romans; the Arabs come after the Malagaâ€™s fall at 714. Muslins
allowed the Tamisa inhabitants conserved their properties, their region and customs or one
of every three parts of the production of the farm and range. Muslins were who contracted the
name of the town and the place started to be Mixa. At the time of the Cordobaâ€™s emirate,
the leader Omar Ben Hafsun conquered Mijas with some other towns like Tolox and Comares. Mijas
was at Bobastroâ€™s army again Abderraman III regains it at ninth century. Later, in
1487, Mijas resisted the Catholic Monarch attacks until the Malagaâ€™s siege. After
this, the inhabitants surrendered and were sold as slaves to the nobility and other gentlemen
who participated in the war and after Granadaâ€™s conquest; they proceed with the
distribution of houses and land of the village to the Christians. A few years after, during the
Communities War, Mijas remained loyal to Carlos I the Emperor and Mijas were given the title of
Very Loyal. Later in 1521, Juana declared exempt from sales tax and gave it the title of
village. At this time and until the beginning of the XVIII century, there was a hard trouble
with the intense pirates activity all over the coast. So at 1492, they started to build
watchtowers along the coastal to prevent the population and to combat pirates (this tower,
can be visited nowadays in Mijas costa). ‘

Modern age’



At XIX century, Mijaâ€™s livelihood, were mainly agriculture and fishing, plus some
farming and mineral extraction. And vines were the main wealth of Mijas until the Philloxera
plague destroyed all the plantations. Also important was the paper productionâ€™s. It
was found some mills located in the area of â€œOsunillasâ€� 1744. At the half of the
century, was the most productive time in the industry, thanks to the arrival of
Valenciaâ€™s papermakers, a carpenter from Alcoy (a Alicanteâ€™s Spanish town)
and a mop, which created new functional links on this manufacture. Especially notable was the
â€œpaper bedsâ€�, very useful at Malaga because they used it as a raisins wrapper.
An important historical thing happened on December 2, 1831. General Torrijos landed at the
beach â€œEl charcÃ³nâ€� with 52 men. They crossed Mijas, upped the hill to the top
and refugee at a house on â€œAlqueriaâ€� in â€œAlhaurin de la torreâ€�,
Molinas County property. They were surrounded by the troops of the governor Gonzales Moreno.
And Torrijos and his companion were shot on the San Andres beaches on December 11, 1831. In 1873
they opened the road between Mijas and Fuengirola. Fuengirola was segregated from Mijas in
1841. However, the village remained isolated until the second republic, when the firsts
newspaper arrives. There was no phone until 1953 and as descriptions of the time; the town
consisted mostly of shacks. The population was scattered across the countryside, which had
small farm structure. At the post war period there was much hunger and lack work. The only work
in the area were the collection of grass for the esparto, and this became worse because many
drought. During this year, Mijas also was the scene of anti-Franco army operations thanks to
the support and respect that this army enjoyed in this zone. In the 50â€™s an asbestos
factory came to alleviate unemployment and began building small hotel because the fame that
Costa del Sol was getting. With the advent of tourism the towns of La Cala and Las Laguna and
began construction of residential urbanizations that makes real states like chollocasa,
cala, irentinspain, and many mores born. Las Laguna, appeared out of nowhere from the
interior of the term farmers. The Cala was a rural village with just 19 farming families.

Climate



The Climate of Mijas, due to the proximity of the sea, conditions mild temperatures, with an
average of 18Â Â°C without heat in summer and little frost in winter. The rainfall is
