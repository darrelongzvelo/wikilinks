Excursion to Jordan:



Visit to Mount Nebo,Â  specifically to the Memorial of Moses (Ras Siyagha) and to the Town of
Nebo (Khirbet el-Mukhayyet).

Mount Nebo, Ras Siyagha

Image: http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/escurs/Giord/43nebo03.jpg View from
Ras Siyagha on the Plains of Moab.Â  And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to
the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far
as Dan, all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the
Western Sea, the Negeb, and the Plain, that is, the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, as
far as Zoar Â (Dt 34:1-3).

the retaining wall of the Byzantine Monastery of Mount Nebo on the west side.

To the right is the Ayoun Musa valley (â€œthe Springs of Moses,â€� better seen in the
following photo). The spring were made famous by the pilgrim Egeria:Â  Between the church
and the cells was a plentiful spring which flowed fro the rock, beautifully clear and witn an
excellent tasteâ€Š This is the water which holy Moses gave the children of Israel in this
desert Â ( Egeriaâ€™s Travel Â ,11).

Panoramic view on the North side towards the Ascent from the Plains of Moab to Esbus. In the
foreground, two Roman milestones from the same road (displaced). Pilgrims like Egeria or
Petrus the Iberer were following this route which starts from Livias, in the plain. At the
sixth mile, they did a turn southwards to the Spring of Moses and Mount Nebo.

symbolic landmark on the top of Mount Nebo: the snake which Moses put up in the desert (Num
21,4-9) makes us think of the cross upon which Jesus itself was lifted (Gv 3,14).

to the 18th line, the conquest of the City of Nebo is narrated:

Kemosh said to me, â€œGo, take Nebo from Israel.â€� And I went in the night and fought
against it from the daybreak until midday, and I took it and I killed the whole population:
seven thousand male subjects and aliens, and female subjects, aliens, and servant girls. For
I had put it to the ban for Ashtar Kemosh. And from there I took the vessels of Yahweh, and I
presented them before the face of Kemosh.

Location of Petra in Jordan

Petra Â ( Greek Â â€œÏ€Î­Ï„Ï�Î±â€� (petra), meaningÂ 
rock ;Â  Arabic : Ø§Ù„ØšØªØ±Ø§Ø¡,Â  Al-BatrÄ�ÊŸ ) is aÂ 
historic Â andÂ  archaeological Â city in theÂ  Jordanian governorate ofÂ 
Maâ€™an Â that hasÂ  rock cut architecture Â and a water conduits system.
Established sometime around theÂ  6th century BC Â as the capital city of theÂ 
Nabataeans ,Â it is a symbol of Jordan as well as its most visited tourism
attraction.Â It lies on the slope ofÂ  Mount Hor Â in aÂ  basin Â among the
mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah Â (Wadi Araba), the large valley running
from theÂ  Dead Sea Â to theÂ  Gulf of Aqaba . Petra has been aÂ  UNESCO World Heritage
Site Â since 1985.

The site remained unknown to theÂ  Western world Â until 1812, when it was introduced
byÂ  Swiss Â explorerÂ  Johann Ludwig Burckhardt . It was described as â€œa
rose-red city half as old as timeâ€� in aÂ  Newdigate Prize -winningÂ  sonnet
Â byÂ  John William Burgon .Â  UNESCO Â has described it as â€œone of the most
precious cultural properties of manâ€™s cultural heritage.Â Petra was chosen by
theÂ  BBC Â as one of â€œthe 40 places you have to see before you dieâ€� .

Geography

Pliny the Elder Â and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataeans and the
centre of theirÂ  caravan Â trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a
perennialÂ  stream , Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled
the main commercial routes which passed through it toÂ  Gaza Â in the west, to Bosra
Â andÂ  Damascus Â in the north, toÂ  Aqaba Â andÂ  Leuce Come Â on the Red
Sea , and across the desert to theÂ  Persian Gulf .

The end of the Siq, with its dramatic view ofÂ  Al Khazneh Â (â€œThe
Treasuryâ€�)

Excavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water
supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificialÂ  oasis . The area is
visited byÂ  flash floods Â and archaeological evidence demonstrates the Nabataeans
controlled these floods by the use ofÂ  dams ,Â  cisterns Â and water conduits. These
innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought , and enabled the city to prosper
from its sale.

Petra is known as the Rose-Red City for the colour of the rocks in which Petra is carved

Although in ancient times Petra might have been approached from the south viaÂ  Saudi
Arabia Â on a track leading around Jabal Haroun (â€œAaronâ€™s
Mountainâ€�), across the plain of Petra, or possibly from the high plateau to the north,
most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads
steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge (in places only 3â€“4 m (9.8â€“13 ft)
wide) called theÂ  Siq Â (â€œthe shaftâ€�), a natural geological feature
formed from a deep split in the sandstone Â rocks and serving as a waterway flowing intoÂ 
Wadi Musa . At the end of the narrow gorge stands Petraâ€™s most elaborate ruin,Â  Al
Khazneh Â (popularly known as â€œthe Treasuryâ€�), hewn into the sandstone
cliff.

El Deir (â€œThe Monasteryâ€�)

A little further from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain calledÂ  en-Nejr , is a
massive theatre, so placed as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point
where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking
effect. The amphitheatre Â has been cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs
during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost
enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep
fissures, and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.

History

Evidence suggests that settlements had begun in and around Petra in theÂ  eighteenth
dynasty of Egypt Â (1550-1292 BCE). It is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and theÂ 
Amarna letters Â as Pel, Sela or Seir. Though the city was founded relatively late, a
sanctuary existed there since very ancient times. Stations 19 through 26 of theÂ  stations
list Â ofÂ  Exodus Â are places associated with Petra.Â This part of the country
wasÂ  Biblically Â assigned to theÂ  Horites , the predecessors of the Edomites
.Â The habits of the original natives may have influenced the Nabataean custom of burying
the dead and offering worship in half-excavated caves. Although Petra is usually identified
withÂ  Sela which means aÂ  rock, Â the Biblical referencesÂ refer to it as
â€œthe cleft in the rockâ€�, referring to its entrance. 2Â  Kings Â xiv. 7
seems to be more specific. In the parallel passage, however, Sela is understood to mean simply
â€œthe rockâ€� (2 Chr. xxv. 12, see LXX).

On the authority ofÂ  Josephus Â ( Antiquities of the Jews Â iv. 7, 1~ 4, 7) Eusebius
Â andÂ  Jerome Â ( Onom. sacr. Â 286, 71. 145, 9; 228, 55. 287, 94) assert thatÂ 
Rekem Â was the native name andÂ  Rekem Â appears in the Dead Sea scrolls Â as a
prominent Edom site most closely describing Petra and associated withÂ  Mount Seir . But in
the Aramaic versions Rekem is the name ofÂ  Kadesh , implying that Josephus may have
confused the two places. Sometimes the Aramaic versions give the formÂ  Rekem-Geya
Â which recalls the name of the village El-ji, southeast of Petra.Â The Semitic name of
the city, if not Sela, remains unknown. The passage inÂ  Diodorus Siculus Â (xix.
94â€“97) which describes the expeditions whichÂ  Antigonus Â sent against the
Nabataeans in 312 BCE is understood to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the
â€œpetraâ€� referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper
name and the description implies that the town was not yet in existence.

The Rekem Inscription in 1976

The only place in Petra where the name â€œRekemâ€� occurs was in the rock wall of the
Wadi Musa opposite the entrance to the Siq. About twenty years ago the Jordanians built a
bridge over the wadi and this inscription was buried beneath tons of concrete.

More satisfactory evidence of the date of the earliest Nabataean settlement may be obtained
from an examination of the tombs. Two types have been distinguished: the Nabataean and
theÂ  Greco-Roman . The Nabataean type starts from the simpleÂ  pylon-tomb Â with a
door set in a tower crowned by a parapet ornament, in imitation of the front of a
dwelling-house. Then, after passing through various stages, the full Nabataean type is
reached, retaining all the native features and at the same time exhibiting characteristics
which are partlyÂ  Egyptian Â and partlyÂ  Greek . Of this type there exist close
parallels in the tomb-towers at el-I~ejr in north Arabia, which bear long Nabataean
inscriptions and supply a date for the corresponding monuments at Petra. Then comes a series
of tombfronts which terminate in a semicircular arch, a feature derived from northÂ  Syria
. Finally come the elaborate faÃ§ades copied from the front of aÂ  Roman temple ; however,
all traces of native style have vanished. The exact dates of the stages in this development
cannot be fixed. Strangely, few inscriptions of any length have been found at Petra, perhaps
because they have perished with the stucco or cement which was used upon many of the buildings.
The simple pylon-tombs which belong to the pre-Hellenic age serve as evidence for the
earliest period. It is not known how far back in this stage the Nabataean settlement goes, but
it does not go back farther than the 6th century BCE.

A period follows in which the dominant civilization combines Greek, Egyptian and Syrian
elements, clearly pointing to the age of the Ptolemies . Towards the close of the 2nd century
BCE, when the Ptolemaic andÂ  Seleucid Â kingdoms were equally depressed, the
Nabataean kingdom came to the front. UnderÂ  Aretas III Philhellene , (c.85â€“60
BCE), the royal coins begin. The theatre was probably excavated at that time, and Petra must
have assumed the aspect of a Hellenistic Â city. In the reign ofÂ  Aretas IV Philopatris ,
(9 BCEâ€“40 CE), the fine tombs of the el-I~ejr [?] type may be dated, and perhaps also the
great High-place.

Urn Tomb

Roman rule

In 106 CE, whenÂ  Cornelius Palma Â was governor of Syria, that part ofÂ  Arabia
Â under the rule of Petra was absorbed into theÂ  Roman Empire Â as part ofÂ  Arabia
Petraea , becoming capital. The native dynasty came to an end. But the city continued to
flourish. A century later, in the time of Alexander Severus , when the city was at the height of
its splendor, the issue of coinage comes to an end. There is no more building of sumptuous
tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the neo- Persian
Â power under theÂ  Sassanid Empire . Meanwhile, asÂ  Palmyra Â ( fl.
Â 130â€“270) grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra, the
latter declined. It seems, however, to have lingered on as a religious centre. AÂ  Roman
road Â was constructed at the site.Â  Epiphanius of Salamis Â (c.315â€“403)
writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virginÂ  Khaabou
Â (Chaabou) and her offspringÂ  Dushara Â ( Haer. 51).

Religion

The Nabataeans worshipped theÂ  Arab Â  gods Â andÂ  goddesses Â of theÂ 
pre-Islamic Â times as well as a few of theirÂ  deified Â kings. One,Â  Obodas I , was
deified after his death. Dushara was the main male god accompanied by his female trinity:Â 
Al-â€˜UzzÃ¡ ,Â  Allat Â andÂ  ManÄ�t . Many statues carved in the rock
depict these gods and goddesses.

The Monastery, Petraâ€™s largest monument, dates from the 1st century BCE. It was
dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is
inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic â€œ Ad
Deir â€œ).

Christianity Â found its way to Petra in the 4th century CE, nearly 500 years after the
establishment of Petra as a trade center.Â  Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra
(Anhioch. 10) namedÂ  Asterius . At least one of the tombs (the â€œtomb with the
urnâ€�?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration
â€œin the time of the most holy bishop Jasonâ€� (447). After theÂ  Islamic
Â conquest of 629â€“632 Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to
Islam. During theÂ  First Crusade Â Petra was occupied byÂ  Baldwin I Â of theÂ 
Kingdom of Jerusalem Â and formed the secondÂ  fief Â of theÂ  barony Â ofÂ  Al
Karak Â (in the lordship ofÂ  Oultrejordain ) with the titleÂ  ChÃ¢teau de la
ValÃ©e de Moyse Â or Sela. It remained in the hands of theÂ  Franks Â until 1189. It is
still a titular see Â of theÂ  Catholic Church .

According to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot whereÂ  Moses Â struck a rock with his
staff and water came forth, and where Mosesâ€™ brother, Aaron , isÂ  buried , atÂ 
Mount Hor , known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The Wadi Musa or â€œWadi of
Mosesâ€� is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A
mountaintop shrine of Mosesâ€™ sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time
ofÂ  Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.

Decline

Ad Deir (â€œThe Monasteryâ€�) in 1839, byÂ  David Roberts .

Petra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade
routes. In 363 an earthquake destroyed many buildings, and crippled the vital water
management system.The ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity in theÂ  Middle Ages
Â and were visited byÂ  Sultan Â  Baibars Â of Egypt towards the end of the 13th
century. The first European to describe them wasÂ  Johann Ludwig Burckhardt Â in 1812.

Because the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and
many treasures were stolen.

Threats to Petra

The site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion
due to flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling, improper
restoration of ancient structures, and unsustainable tourism.Â The latter has
increased substantially ever since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007
during the controversialÂ  New Seven Wonders of the World Internet and cell phone
campaign, started by a private corporation.

The Petra Visitors Center inÂ  Wadi Musa , the closest town to the historic site

On December 6, 1985, Petra was designated aÂ  World Heritage Site .

In 2006 the design of a Visitor Centre began.Â  The Jordan Times reported in December 2006
that 59,000 people visited in the two months October and November 2006, 25% fewer than the same
period in the previous year.

In popular culture

Petra was the main topic inÂ  John William Burgon â€˜s PoemÂ  Petra . Referring to it
as the inaccessible city which he had heard described but had never seen. The Poem was awarded
theÂ  Newdigate Prize Â in 1845 Â : â€œ It seems no work of Manâ€™s creative
hand, 

by labour wrought as wavering fancy planned;

But from the rock as if by magic grown,

eternal, silent, beautiful, alone!

Not virgin-white like that old Doric shrine,

where erst Athena held her rites divine;

Not saintly-grey, like many a minster fane,

that crowns the hill and consecrates the plain;

But rose-red as if the blush of dawn,

that first beheld them were not yet withdrawn;

The hues of youth upon a brow of woe,

which Man deemed old two thousand years ago,

match me such marvel save in Eastern clime,

a rose-red city half as old as time.

The Madaba Map & The Exodus Route

(mosaic floor)

542 AD

St. Georgeâ€™s Orthodox church

Madaba, Jordan

PRESENTATION

The Madaba Mosaic Map is a unique piece of art realised in 6th cent. A.D. as a decoration for the
pavement of a church in the town of Madaba (Jordan) in the Byzantine Near East. At that time
Madaba was part of the so calledÂ  Provincia Arabia , and was inhabited by Aramaic speaking
Christians descendant from the ancient biblical people of the Moabites. The mosaic was
discovered accidentally about one hundred years ago (in 1897) while constructing a new
church for the Greek-Orthodox Arab community, which was then settling on the very ruins of the
ancient town of Madaba.

The mosaic represents the biblical land from Egypt to Lebanon, including Sinai, Israel,
Palestine, and Transjordan. Unfortunately the northern sector is almost completely lost,
and the rest suffered a lot of damage too. The original panel would have measured about 94
square meter but only 25 are still preserved. What remains is still of the greatest importance
for art, history and biblical topography. The city of Jerusalem is depicted with the
uppermost care but a total of 156 places or biblical memoirs are present in the preserved
portion of the map.

The mosaicist conceived and carried out his masterwork with great topographical skill and
biblical knowledge. The Madaba Mosaic map is deemed by some scholars to be the best
topographic representation ever done before modern cartography. As a source of biblical
topography the map is fully comparable with the well-known treatise on the biblical places
written in Greek about 395 A.D. by the historian Eusebius of Caesarea and translated into
Latin by Jerome about 490 A.D.

Our aim is to present the richness of this little known masterpiece of art , religion and
science to all people interested in the biblical places or just in the best achievements of
humanity.

The RealÂ Geography Of Madaba

    Madaba in the Bible:

    1 - â€œâ€�But we have cast them down, Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon, Then we
    have laid waste even to Nophah, WhichÂ  reaches to Medeba.â€�” Numbers 21:30

    

    2 - â€œfrom Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is
    in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon;â€� Joshua
    13:9

    

    3 - â€œTheir territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
    with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba;â€�
    Joshua 13:16

    

    4 - â€œSo they hired for themselves 32,000 chariots, and the king of Maacah and his
    people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered together from
    their cities and came to battle.â€� 1 Chronicles 19:7

    

    5 - â€œThey have gone up to the temple andÂ  toÂ  Dibon,Â  evenÂ  to the high
    places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyoneâ€™s head is baldÂ 
    andÂ  every beard is cut off.â€� Isaiah 15:2

    



The Mosaic Map of Madaba, Jordan

It was the Christian vision of continuity and completeness that inspired the mosaic artists
and craftsmen of the area to make the Mosaic Map of Madaba, which was considered a guideline for
establishing geographic regions and borders.

This famous mosaic was designed in around 570 AD to decorate the floor of a Byzantine church
inÂ  Madaba . Actually, it is more than a geographic text of that era, showing the entire
region from Jordan and Palestine in the north, to Egypt in the south, and depicting in picture
form: plains, hills, valleys, villages, and many towns and cities, complete with walls and
pitched re-roofed houses, while in the Nile huge fish swim.

It includes a fascinating plan of the holy city ofÂ  Jerusalem Â placed at the center of
the redeemed acumen: on the left is the north gate from which two colonnaded streets run south.
On the straight street through the heart of the city stands the domedÂ  Holy Sepulcher .
Clearly inscribed above the north and east gates is the legend â€œHoly City of
Jerusalemâ€�.

Today this splendid map is housed in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, which was built in
1896 over the remains of the original Byzantine Church. Only part of the map has been
preserved. It originally measured a staggering 25 x 5 meters and was made of more than 2 million
pieces of colored stone tesserae.

Madaba, Jordan

The trip south from Amman along the 5000-year-oldÂ  Kingâ€™s Highway Â is one of
the most memorable journeys in the Holy Land, passing through a string of ancient sites. The
first city you come upon is Madaba, â€œThe City of Mosaicsâ€�.

In many respects Madaba is a typical East Bank town which differs in one major aspect:
underneath almost every house lies a fine Byzantine mosaic. Many of these mosaics have been
excavated and are on display in the townâ€™s museum, but it is estimated that many more
lie hidden waiting to be discovered.

http://mannaismayaadventure.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/3-mosaic-w-notes-c-beck-350.jpg?w=450

Madabaâ€™s chief attraction â€“ in the contemporary Greek Orthodox church of St.
George â€“ is a wonderfully vivid, 6th-century ByzantineÂ  mosaic map Â showing
the entire region from Jordan and Palestine in the north, to Egypt in the south.

This map includes a fascinating plan ofÂ  Jerusalem : on the left is the north gate from which
two colonnaded streets run south. On the straight street through the heart of the city stands
the domedÂ  Holy Sepulcher . Clearly inscribed above the north and east gates is the legend
â€œHoly City of Jerusalemâ€�.

Other mosaic masterpieces found in the church of the Virgin and the Apostles and the
Archaeological Museum, depict a rampant profusion of flowers and plants, birds and fish,
animals and exotic beasts, as well as scenes from mythology and everyday pursuits of hunting,
fishing and farming. Literally, hundreds of other mosaics from the 5th through the 7th
centuries are scattered throughout Madabaâ€™s churches and homes.

Madaba has a long history, dating back further than 1300 BC. It was first mentioned in the Bible
as Medeba at the time of the Exodus (Numbers: 21,30; Joshua 13:9), it was then an Amorite town
close to the Moab border, and it changed hands frequently. It was named in the famous Mesha
Stele, or Moabite Stone (exhibited inÂ  Jordan Archaeological Museum ), which recorded
the achievements of Mesha, King of Moab in the mid-9th century BC â€“ one of which was to
regain Madaba from the Israelites.

The Nabataeans governed the city during the 1st century AD. And in the Hellenistic period,
under the Romans, it was a flourishing provincial town with temples and colonnaded streets
and surrounded by a strong wall. Under the Byzantines, Madaba became the seat of a bishopric,
and in 451 AD, its bishop attended the Council of Chalcedon. During this period, and
particularly in the 6th century, mosaics were lavished on churches and public and private
buildings.

Madaba was sacked by the Persians in 614, and its ruin was completed by the earthquake of 747. It
stood abandoned for over 1000 years until, around 1880, a group of about 2000 Christians from
Kerak Â settled here. It was they, in the process of rebuilding, who found the mosaics
buried under the rubble.

Madaba museum has many mosaics that were originally on the site. Also, mosaics from other
locations have been housed in the museum to ensure their preservation. A collection of
Byzantine churches as well as ancient Roman remnants and mosaics, make up this spectacular
museum which is located near the Mosaics School.

The Mosaic Map of Madaba

    A. Madaba in the Bible:

    1 - â€œâ€�But we have cast them down, Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon, Then we
    have laid waste even to Nophah, WhichÂ  reaches to Medeba.â€�” Numbers 21:30

    

    2 - â€œfrom Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is
    in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon;â€� Joshua
    13:9

    

    3 - â€œTheir territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
    with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba;â€�
    Joshua 13:16

    

    4 - â€œSo they hired for themselves 32,000 chariots, and the king of Maacah and his
    people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered together from
    their cities and came to battle.â€� 1 Chronicles 19:7

    

    5 - â€œThey have gone up to the temple andÂ  toÂ  Dibon,Â  evenÂ  to the high
    places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyoneâ€™s head is baldÂ 
    andÂ  every beard is cut off.â€� Isaiah 15:2

    



The exodus route: Border of Egypt



    Image:
    http://www.bible.ca/archeology/maps-bible-archeology-exodus-ancient-geographers-madaba-map-israel-egypt-border.jpg

    1 - The Wadi el-Arish is the same as the River of Egypt in Gen 15:18

    

    

    1 - All Bible maps have wrongly located Kadesh Barnea atÂ  Ein el-Qudeirat Â since
    1916 AD. Yet Qudeirat, if they thought it was important, would have been located on a
    section of the map that is fully intact. Qudeirat should be located close to the large red
    text, â€œlot of Simeonâ€�. (see above)

    

    

    1 - The sea port for where the Wadi el-Arish empties into the Mediterranean sea is called
    el-Arish. The port of Arish is also called Tharu and Rhinocolura. These three names refer
    to the same place. Rhinocolura gets its name from the fact it was a prison city for
    criminals of Egypt whom the Pharaoh would literally cut off their noses
    â€œRhino-coluraâ€� and force them to live in this sea port on the far edge of
    Egyptian territory. Arish has been the western border of Egypt since 2000 BC.

    



Between the towns of Bitylium and Rhinocolura are the following red words in the Madaba Map:
Border of Egypt and Palestine â€œHoroi Aigyptou kai Paleaistinesâ€�.

One of the most important things the Madaba map shows is that the border of Egypt was at the Wadi
al-Arish. This is the historic border between Egypt and Israel from 1440 BC, the time of the
exodus , to 70 AD, when Israel was destroyed. In modern times the border has been moved 44 km
north east to Raphia at the eastern edge of the Gaza Strip. You can see from the Madaba map that
the border is between Bitylium and Rhinoculura (Arish).

Raphia at the eastern edge of the Gaza Strip. You can see from the Madaba map that the border is
between Bitylium and Rhinoculura (Arish).



    Image:
    http://www.bible.ca/archeology/maps-bible-archeology-exodus-ancient-geographers-madaba-map-el-arish-rhinocolura.jpg

    1 - The Bible clearly shows that the border between Egypt and Israel was just north of
    theÂ  Wadi al-Arish : Genesis 15:18; Joshua 15:4,47. The Wadi al-Arish is the
    southern/eastern border of the promised land.

    

    2 - This proves that the modern Sinai Peninsula was under the control of Egypt and
    considered Egyptian territory, just as it is today. Since we can prove the Sinai
    Peninsula was â€œEgyptianâ€� this proves that Mt. Sinai cannot be where Queen
    Helena chose it to be in a dream in 325 AD, at Mt. Musa, beside the St. Catherineâ€™s
    monastery. Mt. Sinai was not in Egypt. The Bible says that Mt. Sinai was located in Arabia,
    not Egypt. (Gal 4:25)

    

    3 - The Onomasticon tells us that Bitylium was 20 km south of Raphia.
    â€œBÄ“thphouÂ (Bathaffu). (In) tribe of Juda. A village fourteen miles
    beyond Raphia on the road to Egypt. It is the border of Palestine.â€�Â  The
    Onomasticon and the Exodus route . by Eusebius (325AD)

    C. The exodus route: Red Sea, Mt. Sinai, Kadesh/Petra

    1 - Missing entirely from the Madaba Map is the Red Sea, Mt. Sinai and Petra/Kadesh Barnea.
    It would certainly be on the map, but was vandalized by the Muslims in 700 AD. Since we know
    these locations would be on the map, they must have been the primary targets of
    defacement. Most notably, however, is that the modern choice for the location of Kadesh
    Barnea atÂ  Ein el-Qudeirat , should be in a section of the map that is fully intact.
    Qudeirat should be located close to the large red text, â€œlot of Simeonâ€�.

    

    2 - Petra is not on the Madaba map and it most certainly would have been. Petra is where
    Eusebius located Kadesh Barnea, the Mt. Hor, the rock Moses struck, the place Miriam
    died. It would have been located in a section that is missing. We would expect it to be
    directly above Praesidium, Thamara, Moa and above and to the left of â€œThe desert
    where the Serpent of brass saved the Israelites

    



    Image:
    http://www.bible.ca/archeology/maps-bible-archeology-exodus-ancient-geographers-madaba-map-arabah-petra.jpg

    1 - There is one reference in the Bible to the â€œWilderness of Kadeshâ€� and
    this is also marked on the Madaba Map as the â€œDesert ofâ€�, just south of the
    dead sea: â€œThe voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; The Lord shakes the
    wilderness of Kadesh.â€� Psalm 29:8

    

    2 - Kadesh Barnea, if located atÂ  Qudeirat , as most today wrongly believe, should be
    located on the map in a section that is not damaged. It is not located there. No where on the
    Madaba map is Kadesh Barnea located. However, if it was, there is absolute certainly that
    the church from the time of Christ down to 600 AD believed Kadesh Barnea was located at
    Petra.

    





Image:
http://www.bible.ca/archeology/bible-archeology-exodus-ancient-geographers-herodotus-maps-450bc2.jpg

    To complicate matters, it is well documented that geographers from the time of Herodotus
    (450 BC) right up to the 17th century AD, had almost no concept of the Gulf of Aqaba. The
    Madaba map, in fact, looks exactly like the map of Herodotus below. EvenÂ  Strabo in 15
    ADÂ  had no idea of the Gulf of Aqaba. Compare the map of Herodotus with the Madaba map as
    they are based upon the same common misunderstanding of the â€œVâ€� shaped Red
    Sea that branches into the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba.

    1 - It is truly sad that this portion of the Madaba map is missing that shows Mt. Sinai and the
    shape of the Red Sea.

    

    2 - We must keep in mind that in 545 AD, the prevailing view of the Western/Latin church
    (Rome/Roman Catholic) was that Mt. Sinai was located at Mt. Musa in the modern Sinai
    peninsula. The Madaba Map is located deep into Eastern/Greek
    (Constantinople/Orthodox) territory of the church. It is entirely possible that there
    was a rift between east and west as to the real location of Mt. Sinai. Perhaps the Madaba map
    located Mt. Sinai on the eastern side of the Gulf of Suez. All this is speculation of
    course. On the other hand, with their misunderstanding of the existence of the Gulf of
    Aqaba, it may have been mapped the same way on the Madaba map even if it was located in the
    traditional location west of the Gulf of Aqaba, or where the Bible says it is: in Saudi
    Arabia (Gal 4:25) on the east side of the Gulf of Aqaba.

    

    3 - Two little letters â€œMEâ€� on the top of the Madaba map just right of Zered
    Wadi, simply cannot be Kadesh Barnea. Both Eusebius and Jerome believed Kadesh was at
    Petra. Petra was such a major center that many of their references were based upon
    distances from Petra/Kadesh.

    



    D. The exodus route: Wilderness of Sin and Rephidim

    1 - Some translated maps of the Madaba map show theÂ  Wilderness of Sin Â as the
    Wilderness of Zin. These are two very different places and wildernesses. The wilderness
    of Sin is when Israel got the Sabbath revealed for the first time. it is also the place they
    first got Manna and also quail for food. (Ex 16:13) The wilderness of Zin is north of
    Kadesh, but includes Kadesh. (Num 27:14) Zin is transjordan and north of Petra in Modern
    Jordan. Twice during the Exodus God gave Israel quail. First at Sin and second at
    Kibroth-hattaavah (Num 11:34) and is one stop after Mt. Sinai. (Num 33:16) Therefore the
    Madaba map says, â€œWilderness of Zin: The desert where the Serpent of brass saved
    the Israelitesâ€�, it translated incorrectly and should be the Wilderness of Sin.
    We are certain that the makers of the map knew the difference. Of course if it was the
    wilderness of Zin, that would directly locate Kadesh Barnea, but then we would not make
    sense of it because the story of the Manna and quails did not happen there. So it is the
    wilderness of Sin before Sinai, not Zin at Kadesh.

    

    2 - Petra is not on the Madaba map. It would have been located in a section that is missing. We
    would expect it to be directly above Praesidium, Thamara, Moa and above and to the left of
    â€œThe desert where the Serpent of brass saved the Israelitesâ€�.(see
    below).

    

    3 - The placement of the Wilderness of Sin and Rephidim on the Madaba map is a problem for
    those who place Mt. Sinai in the mountainous area directly below both. We believe that Mt.
    Sinai, if it was on the map, would in the missing section at the right of this mountain
    range.

    

    4 - Both the â€œDesert of Sin where were sent down the manna and the quailsâ€� (Ex
    16:13) AND â€œRephidim, where Israel fought against Amalek who attacked
    themâ€� (Ex 17:1-8) is a problem for those who believe Mt. Sinai is located in the
    mountain range directly below this text. This mountain range, they believe, represents
    the modern Sinai mountain range where Mt. Musa is located. The problem is that Israel
    entered the wilderness of Sin and Rephidim BEFORE they reached Mt. Sinai not after.

    

    5 - But even if Mt. Sinai was located on the other side of this Mt. range the order is still
    reversed: The map has them entering Rephidim first, then the wilderness of Sin second,
    then Mt. Sinai, so even the sequential order is backwards in addition to the major
    distortions of distance typical of this kind of â€œdevotional mapâ€�.

    

    6 - Then we need to figure out how the section of the map that says, â€œdesert where the
    serpent of brass saved the Israelitesâ€� fits into all this. We know that this event
    happened east of Kadesh/Petra. This means we would expect to find Petra somewhere
    directly below this text that highlights the events of Num 21:4-9.

    



What we do learn from all this, is that their understanding of the Gulf of Aqaba was as bad as
their understanding of the Bible geography as the scriptures revealed.

http://www.bible.ca/archeology/maps-bible-archeology-exodus-ancient-geographers-madaba-map-arabah-petra.jpg

    E. The exodus route: Arabah Valley, Zoar, Tamara and Moa

    1 - The words â€œdesert ofâ€� are likely a reference to either the Arabah Valley
    or possibly the â€œDesert of Cades/Kadeshâ€� frequently referenced by
    Eusebius in his Onomasticon. The Arabah valley is easy to distinguish on a visual basis,
    since it would be to the right of the Dead Sea and above the three mountain ranges that
    Mampsis is located in the middle of. Perhaps Eusebius and the Madaba map were inspired by
    this verse to located the Desert of Kadesh: â€œThe voice of the Lord shakes the
    wilderness; The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.â€� Psalm 29:8

    

    2 - The fort at Zoar is exactly where we would expect to find it: just above the right end of
    the Dead sea.

    

    3 - The series of three forts directly to the right of the Dead sea are known locations.
    First is Praesidium thought to be at al-Fayfa. Second is Thamara is mentioned in the
    Onomasticon and is located at Tamara. The third is Moa, perhaps located at near Nahal
    â€˜Omer.

    

    4 - In 1910, Schmidt viewed Kadesh as being atÂ  Qedeis Â and viewed Ein El Weibeh Â 
    as being the location for Thamara: â€œEdward Robinson, on his visit to â€˜Ain el
    Webeh, June 2, 1838, was so strongly impressed with this most important watering place in
    the â€˜Arabah that he identified it with Kadesh Barnea. His description of it was
    quite accurate. On the assumption that â€� Mount Seir â€� and â€œthe land
    of Edom â€� had the â€˜Arabah for its western border, and that all Biblical
    statements are equally reliable and must at any price be harmonized, he could scarcely
    reach a different conclusion. When I visited the place in June, 1905, I was particularly
    impressed with the large number of palm trees and the excellence of the water in one of the
    springs. The references to Thamara in Ptolemy, the Peutinger Tables, the Notitia, the
    Onomasticon, the Madeba mosaic, and the recently discovered Beersheba rescript have
    convinced me that this place is to be looked for at â€˜Ain el Webeh.â€� ( Kadesh
    Barnea , Nathan Schmidt, 1910 AD)

    

    5 - Tamara: For a full discussion of Tamara/Thamara, see:Â  Tamar .

    

    6 - Tamara: Eusebius says in the Onomasticon: â€œAsasan Thamar (Asasonthamar).
    Where the Amorrites dwelled whom Chodollagomor destroyed is located near the
    wilderness of Cades. It is said there is a village Tharmara (a fort Thamara) one day
    journey from Mapsis on the road from Hebron to Ailam. [Elat on the Red Sea, see Ailam] Today
    there is a garrison (Roman fort) of soldiers there.â€� Footnote #: 8: Asasan Thamar
    (Asasonthamar). Genesis 14:7; K. 8:6; L. 234:84. On the Madaba Map there is a Thamara
    located as suggested by Eusebius here. Tabula Peutinger Â has a Thamaro 52 or 53 miles
    from Jerusalem while Ptolemyâ€™s list (V, 15, 5f) has a Thamaro about 55 miles
    distant. TheÂ  Notitia Dignitatum Â (74:40) has a Tarba and (74:46) a Thamarra both
    of which have a garrison. Alt found a fort atÂ  Qasr el Juheiniye Â and he is followed
    by many locating the fort there and the village atÂ  â€˜ain el â€˜Arus .
    Aharoni more recently ( TEJ , 1963, p.30ff) suggestsÂ  â€˜Ain Husb Â which is
    about a dayâ€™s walk (32 km) from Kurnub which is generally identified with Mapsis
    (cf. also Avi-Yonah) and has a large Roman fort as well as Nabatean and Iron II sherds. The
    Madaba Map using Jeromeâ€™s spelling has located properly Mampsis. Many
    Nabatean, Roman-Byzantine levels excavated atÂ  Kuroub . It shows a revival in the
    fourth century A.D. as also does Oboda (Avdat, â€˜Abda, and K. 176:9).This may be
    indicated by â€œvillageâ€� in Greek and â€œoppidumâ€� in Latin
    (cf. K. 10:25). II Chronicles 20:2 identified Thamar with En Gedi or at least locates it in
    the district of En Gedi (86:16). Jerome inÂ  Hebrew Questions Â says, â€œhis
    city which we now call Engaddi, is rich in balsam and palms since Asason Thamar translated
    into our language is city of the palmsâ€™â€� (18) (cf. Judges 1: 16, Ezekiel
    47: 29).

    

    7 - Tamar is was identified by Rudolph Cohen to be En Haseva. â€œIn an article last year
    (BA 57:4119941), we outlined the Roman, Nabatean, and Iron Age remains at (and presented
    arguments for the identification of the site with the biblical Tamar and the Tamara
    mentioned in Roman and Byzantine sources. (En Haseva, Rudolph Cohen, The Biblical
    Archaeologist, Vol. 58, No. 4, Pots & People. (Dec., 1995), pp. 223-235., 1995 AD) This
    identification of Tamar with En Haseva is quite uncertain. For full discussion see:
    Tamar

    

    8 - Moa: Rudolph Cohen says that, Moa unknown to Eusebius, is located at Nahal â€˜Omer
    in the central Arabah: â€œMoâ€™a (Arabic: Kh. Maiyat â€˜Awad) is
    situated near Nahal â€˜Omer in the central â€˜Arabah (map ref. 1654 9947). It
    was first surveyed in 1933 by F. Frank. He distinguished the exact ground plan of the
    principal building, which he described as a Roman castellum, and noted additional
    structures on hills to the east and west. He proposed the identification of the site with
    Asuada, referred to in the Notitia Dignitatum (early fourth century C.E.). Abel and
    Avi-Yonah proposed the identification of Maiyat â€˜Awad with Moâ€™a, which
    appears on the Madaba mapâ€Š Moâ€™a was clearly an important way-station on
    the road from Petra to Gaza, and consisted of a number of building units. Agricultural
    terraces were surveyed over a wide area in its neighborhood. The finds indicate that it
    was founded in the third-second centuries B.C.E., reached its zenith during the reign of
    Aretas IV, and continued to exist even after the Roman annexation of the Nabatean kingdom
    in 106 C.E., until the end of the third century. In recent years the site has been surveyed
    by numerous scholars. In 1980, in the framework of the Negev Emergency Survey,
    Moâ€™a was examined by a team directed by D. Nahlieli. â€Š Moâ€™a was
    clearly an important way-station on the road from Petra to Gaza, and consisted of a number
    of building units. Agricultural terraces were surveyed over a wide area in its
    neighbourhood. The finds indicate that it was founded in the third-second centuries
    B.C.E., reached its zenith during the reign of Aretas IV, and continued to exist even
    after the Roman annexation of the Nabatean kingdom in 106 C.E., until the end of the third
    century.â€� (Rudolph Cohen, Notes and News, Israel Exploration Journal 32, 1982
    AD, p164-165)

    



E. The exodus route: Shechem (Nabulus) Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal.



Image:
http://www.bible.ca/archeology/maps-bible-archeology-exodus-ancient-geographers-madaba-map-jordan-river.jpg

    The Madaba map places the two mountains twice, in two different locations: On the Madaba
    map, the mountains of Ebal and Gerizim are in two different locations. One is at Shechem
    (Modern Nabulus) and one near Jericho and Gilgal. This is because the Orthodox Jews had
    created a new location near Jericho in their longstanding dispute with the Samaritans.
    Eusebius, Jerome and the creators of the Madaba map were fully aware of the two traditions
    and chose to represent both on the map.

    1 - In 325 AD, Eusebius believed that the Samaritanâ€™s choice for Mt. Gerizim was
    wrong and said so in hisÂ  Onomasticon Â which he wrote in 325 AD. He likely based this
    on the Bible verse that said it was opposite Gilgal: â€œAre they [Mt. Ebal and
    Gerizim] not across the Jordan, west of the way toward the sunset, in the land of the
    Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?â€�
    Deuteronomy 11:30

    From the Onomasticon of 325 AD:

    Mt. Ebal : â€œGaibal (Gebal). Mountain in the Promised Land where Moses commanded an
    altar to be built (at the command of Moses an alter was built). They say (there are) two
    neighboring mountains facing each other located at (near) Jericho, one of which (is
    said) to be Garizin [Gerizim], the other Gaibal [Ebal]. But the Samaritans erroneously
    point out two others near Neapolis (argue for two mountains near Neapolis but they err
    greatly) since the great distance of one from the other there shows that they are not able
    to hear one another when calling out from one (hear the voices calling out in turn blessing
    or cursing as Scripture records).â€� (Eusebius,Â  Onomasticon Â 325 AD)

    Mt. Gerizim : â€œGarizein (Garizin). Mountain where those calling out the blessing
    (curse) stood. Read the above mentioned Gaibal (Gebal).â€� (Eusebius,Â 
    Onomasticon Â 325 AD)

    Gilgal : â€œGolgol or Galgal. The Scriptures teach this is near Mt. Garisein and
    Mt.Gaibal. The place of Galgal is in the Jericho region (near Jericho). [Therefore the
    Samaritans err who would point out Mt.Gairsin and Mt.Gebal near Neapolis which
    Scripture testifies are near Galgal.]â€� (Eusebius,Â  Onomasticon Â 325
    AD)

    Footnote Â fromÂ  Onomasticon Â : This and the following entry can be treated
    together. TheÂ  Onomasticon Â begins by recording the simple biblical
    information here. The generally accepted tradition is to follow the Samaritan
    tradition as given here. The two mountains are on either side of Neapolis (K. 4:28) and
    areÂ  Jebel es-Slamiyeh Â andÂ  Jebel et Tur . The Madaba Map reflects this
    tradition by having them near Shechem (K. 150:1) called Garizin and GÅ�bel. The
    pilgrims also recognize this identity. â€œAt Neapolis is Mt Gazaren where the
    Samaritans say Abraham brought the sacrifice. And to ascend up to the summit are 300
    steps. At the foot of the mountain is located a place by the name of Shechemâ€� ( Itin.
    Bourd. Â  PPT Â I, 18). Zeno and Justinian built churches on Garizein according to
    ProcopiusÂ  Buildings Â V, vii, 5-17. Excavation of this area is going on. But
    Eusebius and Jerome prefer to follow an anti-Samaritan location. The Madaba map
    hesitates between the two opinions and so locates Gebal Garizeini near IerichÅ�
    [Jericho] (K. 104:25). The use of the LXX names in IerichÅ� region and the Aramaic in
    the Neapolis area may signify some preference. Since Josephus and the later Byzantines
    had the correct tradition, this rabbinic tradition must have developed in the late first
    and early second centuries. Procopius 905C is also confused: â€œThis is situated at
    the Eastern part of IerichÅ� beyond Galgalâ€� and he continues by denying the
    Samaritan tradition. Yet in 908A he seems to accept the Samaritan location and
    tradition. The two mountains near Jericho are probably those aboveÂ  Aqaba jabr
    Â sometimes called Tyros and Thrax. The Roman road to Jerusalem passed between them.
    InÂ  Interpretation of Hebrew Names Â â€œGebal, ancient abyss or stone
    buildingâ€� (87). (Eusebius, Onomasticon Â 325 AD)

    

    2 - Herbert Donner comments on this: â€œThe mountains Gerizim and Ebal are
    represented twice on the Madaba Map: near Jericho and near Neapolis. What has happened
    here? The problem can be solved on the basis of Eus. On. 64:9-14 where, strangely enough,
    both mountains are indeed located near Jericho. Eusebius, however, does not fail to add:
    â€œThe Samaritans show other ones near Neapolis, but they are wrong, for the
    mountains shown by them are too far from each other, so that it is impossible to hear
    oneÂŽs voice when calling to each other.â€� Although this seems to be entirely
    intelligible and is confirmed by Deut. 27, the Samaritans were by no means wrong.
    Eusebius was wrong, and everybody knew it, perhaps he himself included. The Samaritans
    laid claim to the mountains, considering them to be their own holy mountains. Hostility
    to the Samaritans forced the orthodox Jews in Jerusalem to locate both mountains at
    another spot, for the Samaritans were not allowed to be right. Eusebius followed the
    orthodox Jewish tradition. The mosaicist, however, being well informed, preferred a
    Solomonic solution: he listed the mountains twice, indicating by larger letters that he
    regarded the location near Nablus as being correct.â€� (Herbert Donner, The
    Mosaic Map of Madaba, Kampen 1992, 24.48)

    

    3 - Here is aÂ  detailed study of the SamaritansÂ  and why they chose Mt. Gerizim as
    â€œtheir Jerusalemâ€�.

Comment:Â 

It must be noted, that Eusebius calls Mt Hermon

the :Mount of the Amoritesâ€� of Deut 1:19, 20

Not the â€œsouthern Slopes of Judeaâ€� whichÂ  was occupied by
theÂ HittitesÂ and Jebusites, not Amorites. We all recall from whom Abraham bought

a grave for Sarah, aÂ Hittite.

Eusebius would appear to be correct as Aphek, north of Sidon, is

called the â€œborder of the Amoritesâ€� by Joshua 13:4

Historians and theÂ Amarna LettersÂ locate the land of the Amorites in

the north.

If we add Joshua 24:8 we get, from the bible itself, a completely

different picture of where Kadesh may have been

â€œâ€˜I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. â€œ

The bible seems to indicate aÂ Kadesh BarneaÂ in what is nowÂ Syria. Something to
think about.

Chinese ceramic ware Â shows a continuous development since the pre-dynastic periods,
and is one of the most significant forms ofÂ  Chinese art .Â  China Â is richly endowed
with the raw materials needed for makingÂ  ceramics . The first types of ceramics were made
during theÂ  Palaeolithic Â era. Chinese Ceramics range from construction materials
such as bricks and tiles, to hand-builtÂ  pottery vessels fired in bonfires or kilns, to the
sophisticated Chinese porcelain wares made for the imperial court. Porcelain is also
occassionally called â€œchinaâ€� in English.

Introduction



Terminology and categories



Image:

A qingbai porcelain vase, bowl, and model of aÂ  granary Â with transparent blue-toned
glaze, from the period of the Song Dynasty Â (960-1279 AD).

Porcelain Â â€�it is a collective term comprising all ceramic ware that is white and
translucent, no matter what ingredients are used to make it or to what use it is
put.â€�Â The Chinese tradition recognizes two primary categories of ceramics,
high-fired [cÃ­ ç“·] and low-fired [tÃ¡o é™¶].Â TheÂ  oldest Chinese
dictionaries Â define porcelain [cÃ­ ç“·] as â€œfine, compact
potteryâ€� [tÃ¡o é™¶].Â Chinese ceramic wares can also classified as being
eitherÂ  northern Â orÂ  southern . Present-day China comprises two separate and
geologically different land masses, brought together by the action ofÂ  continental
drift Â and forming a junction that lies between theÂ  Yellow river Â and theÂ 
Yangtze river . The contrasting geology of the north and south led to differences in the raw
materials available for making ceramics.

Materials



    Chinese porcelain is mainly made by a combination of the following materials:

    - Kaolin Â - essential ingredient composed largely of the clay mineralÂ  kaolinite
    .

    

    - Pottery stone Â - are decomposedÂ  micaceous Â orÂ  feldspar Â  rocks ,
    historically also known asÂ  petunse .

    

    - Feldspar

    

    - Quartz

Technical developments



In the context of Chinese ceramics, the termÂ  porcelain Â lacks a universally accepted
definition. This in turn has led to confusion about when the first Chinese porcelain was made.
Claims have been made for the lateÂ  Eastern Han Â period (100 to 200 AD), theÂ  Three
Kingdoms Â period (220 to 280 AD), theÂ  Six Dynasties Â period (220 to 589 AD), and
theÂ  Tang Dynasty Â (618 to 906 AD).

Early wares



TheÂ  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Â in 2009 reports that pottery
that dates back to 18,000 years ago in theÂ  Yuchanyan Cave Â in southern China has been
found, making it among the earliest pottery yet found.Â Fragments of pottery vessels
dating from around 9000 BC found at the Xianrendong Â (Spirit Cave) site,Â  Wannian
County , in the province ofÂ  Jiangxi Â represent some of the earliest known Chinese
ceramics. The wares were hand-made byÂ  coiling Â and fired inÂ  bonfires .
Decorations include impressed cord marks, and features produced by stamping and by
piercing.

The Xianrendong site was occupied from about 9000 BC to about 4000 BC. During this period two
types of pottery were made. The first consisted of coarse-bodied wares possibly intended for
everyday use. The second being finer, thinner-bodied wares possibly intended for ritual use
or special occasions. There is archaeological evidence suggesting that both types of wares
were produced at the same time at some point.

Han dynasty, 202 BC-220 AD



Some experts believe the first true porcelain was made in theÂ  province Â ofÂ 
Zhejiang Â during theÂ  Eastern Han period.Â  Shards Â recovered from
archaeological Eastern Han kiln sites estimated firing temperature ranged from 1260 to 1300
Â°C.Â As far back as 1000 BC, the so-calledÂ  â€œPorcelaneous waresâ€�
Â orÂ  â€œproto-porcelain waresâ€� were made using at least someÂ  kaolin
Â fired at high temperatures. The dividing line between the two andÂ  true porcelain
wares Â is not a clear one. Archaeological finds have pushed the dates to as early as theÂ 
Han Dynasty Â (206 BC â€“ 220 AD).

The late Han years saw the early development of the peculiar art form ofÂ  hunping , or
â€œsoul jarâ€�: a funerary jar whose top was decorated by a sculptural
composition. This type vessels became widespread during the followingÂ  Jin Dynasty
Â and theÂ  Six Dynasties .

Sui and Tang dynasties, 581-907



During theÂ  Sui Â andÂ  Tang Â periods (581 to 907) a wide range of ceramics,
low-fired and high-fired, were produced. These included the well-known Tang
lead-glazedÂ  sancai Â (three-colour) wares, the high-firing, lime-glazedÂ  Yue
Â celadon wares and low-fired wares fromÂ  Changsha . In northern China, high-fired,
translucent porcelains were made at kilns in the provinces ofÂ  Henan Â andÂ  Hebei .

One of the first mentions of porcelain by a foreigner was in theÂ  Chain of Chronicles
Â written by the Arabian Â traveler and merchantÂ  Suleiman Â in 851 AD during
theÂ  Tang Dynasty Â who recorded that: â€œ They have in China a very fine clay with
which they make vases which are as transparent as glass; water is seen through them. The vases
are made of clay. â€�

The Arabs were aware of the materials necessary to create glass ware, and he was certain that
the porcelain that he saw was not the usual glass material.

Song and Yuan dynasties, 960-1368



The city ofÂ  Jingdezhen Â (also Jingde Zhen) has been a central place of production
since the early Han Dynasty. In 1004,Â  Jingde Â established the city as the main
production hub for Imperial porcelain. During theÂ  Song Â andÂ  Yuan
Â dynasties, porcelain made in the city and otherÂ  southern China Â kiln sites used
crushed and refined pottery stones alone.

Ming dynasty, 1368-1644



TheÂ  Ming Dynasty Â saw an extraordinary period of innovation in ceramic manufacture.
Kilns investigated new techniques in design and shapes, showing a predilection for colour
and painted design, and an openness to foreign forms.Â TheÂ  Yongle Emperor
Â (1402â€“24) was especially curious about other countries (as evidenced by his
support of the eunuchÂ  Zheng He â€˜s extended exploration of theÂ  Indian Ocean ),
and enjoyed unusual shapes, many inspired byÂ  Islamic Â metalwork,During theÂ 
Xuande Â reign (1425â€“35), a technical refinement was introduced in the
preparation of the cobalt Â used for underglaze blue decoration. Prior to this the cobalt
had been brilliant in colour, but with a tendency to bleed in firing; by adding aÂ  manganese
Â the colour was duller, but the line crisper. Xuande porcelain is now considered among the
finest of all Ming output.Â  Enamelled Â decoration ( such as the one at left ) was
perfected under theÂ  Chenghua Emperor Â (1464â€“87), and greatly prized by
later collectors.Â Indeed by the late sixteenth century, Chenghua and Xuande era works
â€“ especially wine cupsâ€“ had grown so much in popularity, that their prices
nearly matched genuine antique wares of Song or even older. This esteem for relatively recent
ceramics excited much scorn on the part ofÂ  literati scholars Â (such asÂ  Wen
Zhenheng ,Â  Tu Long , andÂ  Gao Lian , who is cited below); these men fancied themselves
arbiters of taste and found the painted aesthetic â€˜vulgar.â€™

In addition to these decorative innovations, the late Ming period underwent a dramatic shift
towards aÂ  market economy , [19] Â exporting porcelain around the world on an
unprecedented scale. Thus aside from supplying porcelain for domestic use, the kilns at
Jingdezhen became the main production centre for large-scaleÂ  porcelain exports to
Europe Â starting with the reign of theÂ  Wanli Emperor Â (1572â€“1620). By
this time,Â  kaolin and pottery stone were mixed in about equal proportions. Kaolin
produced wares of great strength when added to the paste; it also enhanced the whiteness of the
body â€“ a trait that became a much sought after property, especially when form
blue-and-white wares grew in popularity. Pottery stone could be fired at a lower temperature
(1250 Â°C) than paste mixed withÂ  kaolin , which required 1350 Â°C. These sorts of
variations were important to keep in mind because the large southern egg-shaped kiln varied
greatly in temperature. Near the firebox it was hottest; near the chimney, at the opposite end
of the kiln, it was cooler.

Qing dynasty, 1644-1911



Primary source material onÂ  Qing Dynasty Â porcelain is available from both foreign
residents and domestic authors. Two letters written by PÃšre Francois Xavier
dâ€™Entrecolles, aÂ  Jesuit Â missionary and industrialÂ  spy Â who lived
and worked in Jingdezhen in the early eighteenth century, described in detail manufacturing
of porcelain in the city.Â In his first letter dated 1712, dâ€™Entrecolles
described the way in which pottery stones were crushed, refined and formed into little white
bricks, known in Chinese as petuntse . He then went on to describe the refining of china
clayÂ  kaolin Â along with the developmental stages of glazing and firing. He explained
his motives: â€œ Nothing but my curiosity could ever have prompted me to such researches,
but it appears to me that a minute description of all that concerns this kind of work might, be
useful in Europe. â€�

In 1743, during the reign of theÂ  Qianlong Emperor , Tang Ying, the imperial supervisor in
the city produced a memoir entitledÂ  â€œTwenty illustrations of the manufacture of
porcelain.â€� Â Unfortunately, the original illustrations have been lost, but the
text of the memoir is still accessible.

Types of Chinese porcelain wares

Tang Dynasty Â (618â€“907)Â  sancai horse at theÂ  Shanghai Museum

TangÂ  Sancai Â burial wares

Main article:Â  Sancai

Sancai Â meansÂ  three-colours . However, the colours of the glazes used to decorate the
wares of the Tang dynasty were not limited to three in number. In the West, Tang sancai wares
were sometimes referred to asÂ  egg-and-spinach Â by dealers for the use of green,
yellow and white. Though the latter of the two colours might be more properly described asÂ 
amber Â andÂ  off-white Â /Â  cream .

Sancai wares were northern wares made using white and buff-firing secondary kaolins andÂ 
fire clays .Â At kiln sites located atÂ  Tongchuan , Neiqui county inÂ  Hebei Â and
Gongxian inÂ  Henan , [22] Â the clays used for burial wares were similar to those used by
TangÂ  potters . The burial wares were fired at a lower temperature than contemporaneous
whitewares. Burial wares, such as the well-known representations of camels and horses, were
cast in sections, inÂ  moulds Â with the parts luted together using clay slip. In some
cases, a degree of individuality was imparted to the assembled figurines by hand-carving.

Jian tea wares



Jian Â blackwares, mainly comprising tea wares, were made at kilns located inÂ 
Jianyang Â ofÂ  Fujian Â province. They reached the peak of their popularity during
the Song dynasty. The wares were made using locally-won, iron-rich clays and fired in anÂ 
oxidising Â atmosphere at temperatures in the region of 1300 Â°C. The glaze was made
using clay similar to that used for forming the body, except fluxed with wood- ash . At high
temperatures the molten glaze separate to produce a pattern calledÂ  hareâ€™s fur .
When Jian wares were set tilted for firing, drips run down the side, creating evidence of
liquid glaze pooling.

Jian tea bowl Â  Song Dynasty , (960â€“1279);Â  Metropolitan Museum of Art ,

TheÂ  hareâ€™s fur Â Jian tea bowl illustrated in theÂ  Metropolitan Museum of
Art Â inÂ  New York Â was made during the Song dynasty (960 to 1279 AD) and exhibits the
typical pooling, or thickening, of the glaze near the bottom. TheÂ  hareâ€™s fur
Â patterning in the glaze of this bowl resulted from the random effect of phase separation
during early cooling in the kiln and is unique to this bowl. ThisÂ  phase separation Â in
the iron-rich glazes of Chinese blackwares was also used to produce the well-knownÂ 
oil-spot ,Â  teadust andÂ  partridge-feather Â glaze effects. No two bowls have
identical patterning. The bowl also has a dark brownÂ  iron-foot Â which is typical of
this style. It would have been fired, probably with several thousand other pieces, each in its
own stackableÂ  saggar , in a single-firing in a largeÂ  dragon kiln . One such kiln, built
on the side of a steep hill, was almost 150 metres in length, though most Jian dragon kilns were
fewer than 100 metres in length.

An 11th century resident of Fujian wrote: â€œ Tea is of light colour and looks best in black
cups. The cups made at Jianyang are bluish-black in colour, marked like the fur of a hare. Being
of rather thick fabric they retain the heat, so that when once warmed through they cool very
slowly, and they are additionally valued on this account. None of the cups produced at other
places can rival these. Blue and white cups are not used by those who give tea-tasting parties.
â€�

At the time, tea was prepared by whisking powdered leaves that had been pressed into dried
cakes together with hot water, (somewhat akin toÂ  matcha Â inÂ  Japanese Tea
Ceremony ). The water added to this powder produced a white froth that would stand out better
against a dark bowl. Tastes in preparation changed during the Ming dynasty; theÂ  Hongwu
Emperor Â himself preferred leaves to powdered cakes, and would accept only leaf tea as
tribute from tea-producing regions. Leaf tea, in contrast to powdered tea, was prepared by
steeping whole leaves in boiling water â€“ a process that led to the invention of the
teapot and subsequent popularity ofÂ  Yixing Â wares over the dark tea bowls.

Jian tea wares of the Song dynasty were also greatly appreciated and copied inÂ  Japan ,
where they were known asÂ  tenmoku Â wares.

Ding ware

Main article:Â  Ding ware

Ding Â ( Wade-Giles :Â  Ting ) ware was produced in Ding Xian (modern Chu-yang),Â 
Hebei Â Province, slightly south-west ofÂ  Beijing . Already in production when the
Song emperors came to power in 940,Â  Ding ware was the finest porcelain produced in
northern China at the time, and was the first to enter the palace for official imperial use. Its
paste is white, generally covered with an almost transparent glaze that dripped and
collected in â€œtears,â€� (though someÂ  Ding Â ware was glazed a monochrome
black or brown, white was the much more common type). Overall, theÂ  Ding Â aesthetic
relied more on its elegant shape than ostentatious decoration; designs were understated,
either incised or stamped into the clay prior to glazing. Due to the way the dishes were stacked
in the kiln, the edged remained unglazed, and had to be rimmed in metal such as gold or silver
when used as tableware. Some hundred years later, a Southern Song era writer commented that it
was this defect that led to its demise as favoured imperial ware.Â Since the Song court lost
access to these northern kilns when they fled south, it has been argued that Qingbai ware ( see
below ) was viewed as a replacement forÂ  Ding .

Although not as highly ranked asÂ  Ru Â ware, the late Ming connoisseurÂ  Gao Lian
Â awards Ding ware a brief mention in his volumeÂ  Eight Discourses on the Art of Living .
Classified under his sixth discourse, the section on â€œpure enjoyment of cultured
idleness,â€� Master Gao says:

green glaze, and a copper edge;Â  London ,Â  Victoria and Albert Museum , FE.1-1970

Ru ware



Like Ding ware,Â  Ru Â (Wade-Giles:Â  ju ) was produced in North China for imperial
use. The Ru kilns were near the Northern Song capital atÂ  Kaifeng . In similar fashion
toÂ  Longquan celadons , Ru pieces have small amounts of iron in their glaze thatÂ 
oxidize Â and turn greenish when fired in a reducing atmosphere. Ru wares range in
colourâ€”from nearly white to a deep robinâ€™s eggâ€”and often are covered
with reddish-brown crackles. The crackles, or â€œ crazing ,â€� are caused when the
glaze cools and contracts faster than the body, thus having to stretch and ultimately to
split, ( as seen in the detail at right; see also Â . The art historian James Watt comments
that the Song dynasty was the first period that viewed crazing as a merit rather than a defect.
Moreover, as time went on, the bodies got thinner and thinner, while glazes got thicker, until
by the end of the Southern Song the â€˜green-glazeâ€™ was thicker than the body,
making it extremely â€˜fleshyâ€™ rather than â€˜bony,â€™ to use the
traditional analogy ( see section on Â GuanÂ  ware, below ). Too, the glaze tends to drip
and pool slightly, leaving it thinner at the top, where the clay peeps through.

As with Ding ware, the Song imperial court lost access to the Ru kilns after it fled Kaifeng when
the Jin Â invaded, and settled atÂ  Linâ€™an Â inÂ  Hangzhou , towards the
south. There theÂ  Emperor Gaozong founded theÂ  Guan yao Â (â€˜official
kilnsâ€™) right outside the new capital in order to produce imitations of Ru
ware.Â However, posterity has remembered Ru ware as something unmatched by later
attempts; Master Gao says, â€œCompared with Guan yao, the above were of finer substance
and more brilliant luster.

Jun ware

Main article:Â  Jun ware

Jun Â (Wade-Giles:Â  chÃŒn ) ware was a third style of porcelain used at the Northern
Song court. Characterized by a thicker body than Ding or Ru ware, Jun is covered with a
turquoise and purple glaze, so thick and viscous looking that it almost seems to be melting off
its substantial golden-brown body. Not only are Jun vessels more thickly potted, their shape
is much more robust than the fine Jun pieces, yet both types were appreciated at court ofÂ 
Emperor Huizong . Jun production was centered at Jun-tai in YÃŒzhou city,Â  Henan
Province .

Guan ware



Guan Â (Wade-Giles:Â  kuan ) ware, literally means â€œofficialâ€� ware; so
certain Ru, Jun, and even Ding could be consideredÂ  Guan Â in the broad sense of being
produced for the court. Strictly speaking, however, the term only applies to that produced by
an official, imperially-run kiln, which did not start until the Southern Song fled the
advancingÂ  Jin Â and settled atÂ  Linâ€™an . It was during this period that
walls become so thin and glaze so thick that the latter superseded the former in breadth. As the
clay in the foothills around Linâ€™an, was a brownish colour, and the glaze so viscus,
â€˜â€™Guanâ€™â€™ ware became known for its â€œbrown
mouthâ€� (sometimes translated as â€œpurpleâ€�), indicating the top rim or
a vessel where the glaze is thinner and the body shows through.Â Guan ceramics have been
much admired over the years, and very subject to copy.Â Indeed Gao Lain spends the greatest
part of his commentary on describing Guan and its partnerÂ  Ge ware Â (See below: though
similar toÂ  Ge Â ware, Guan tends to have a bluer finish and a more translucent
glaze),Â as though that were the most troublesome, least easily identified type of
pottery.

Ge ware



Ge Â (Wade-Giles:Â  ko ), literally means â€˜big-brotherâ€™ ware, because
legend has it that of two brothers working in Longquan, one made the typical celadon Â style
ceramics, but the elder madeÂ  ge Â ware, produced in his private kiln. Ming
commentator, Gao Lian claims that theÂ  ge Â kiln took its clay from the same site asÂ 
Guan Â ware, which is what accounts for the difficulty in distinguishing one from the other
(though Gao thinks â€œ Ge Â is distinctly inferiorâ€� to Guan).Â Overall, Ge
remains somewhat elusive, but basically comprises two typesâ€”one with a â€˜warm
rice-yellow glaze and two sets of crackles, a more prominent set of darker colour
interspersed with a finer set of reddish lines (calledÂ  chin-ssu tâ€™ieh-hsien
Â or â€˜golden floss and iron threadsâ€™, which can just faintly be detected on
this bowl:Â . The other Ge ware is much like Guan ware, with grayish glaze and one set of
crackles. Once thought to have only been manufactured alongsideÂ  Longquan celadon , per
its legendary founding, Ge is now believed to have also been produced atÂ  Jingdezhen .

While similar to Guan ware, Ge typically has a grayish-blue glaze that is fully opaque with an
almost matte finish ( as seen on this bottle in the Asian Art Museum Â . Its crackle pattern is
exaggerated, often standing out in bold black. Though still shrouded in mystery, many
specialists believe that Ge ware did not develop until the very late Southern Song or even the
Yuan. In any case, enthusiasm for it persisted throughout the Ming;Â  Wen Zhenheng
Â preferred it to all other types of porcelain, in particular for brush washers and water
droppers (although he preferred jade brush washers to porcelain, Guan and Ge were the best
ceramic ones, especially if they have scalloped rims). Differences between later Ming
imitations of Song/Yuan Ge include: Ming versions substitute a white porcelain body; they
tend to be produced in a range of new shapes, for example those for the scholarâ€™s
studio; glazes tend to be thinner and more lustrous; and slip is applied to the rim and base to
simulate the â€œbrown mouth and iron footâ€� of Guan ware.

Qingbai wares

Song Dynasty Â  qingbai Â bowl

Qingbai wares (also called â€˜yingqingâ€™)Â were made at Jingdezhen and at
many other southern kilns from the time of theÂ  Northern Song Dynasty Â until they were
eclipsed in the 14th century by underglaze-decorated blue and white wares. Qingbai inÂ 
Chinese Â literally means â€œclear blue-whiteâ€�. The qingbai glaze is aÂ 
porcelain glaze , so-called because it was made using pottery stone. The qingbai glaze is
clear, but containsÂ  iron Â in small amounts. When applied over a white porcelain body
the glaze produces a greenish-blue colour that gives the glaze its name. Some have incised or
moulded decorations.

The Song dynasty qingbai bowl illustrated was likely made at the Jingdezhen village of
Hutian, which was also the site of the Imperial kilns established in 1004. The bowl has incised
decoration, possibly representing clouds or the reflection of clouds in the water. The body
is white, translucent and has the texture of very-fineÂ  sugar , indicating that it was made
using crushed and refined pottery stone instead of pottery stone andÂ  kaolin . The glaze
and the body of the bowl would have been fired together, in a saggar , possibly in a large
wood-burning dragon-kiln orÂ  climbing-kiln , typical of southern kilns in the period.

Though many Song and Yuan qingbai bowls were fired upside down in special segmented saggars, a
technique first developed at theÂ  Ding kilns inÂ  Hebei Â province. The rims of such
wares were left unglazed but were often bound with bands ofÂ  silver ,Â  copper
Â orÂ  lead .

One remarkable example ofÂ  qingbai Â porcelain is the so-calledÂ  Fonthill Vase ,
described in a guide forÂ  Fonthill Abbey Â published in 1823

Blue and white wares

The vase was made at Jingdezhen, probably around 1300 and was sent as a present toÂ  Pope
Benedict XII Â by one of the lastÂ  Yuan emperors of China, in 1338. The mounts referred to
in the 1823 description were of enamelled silver-gilt and were added to the vase in Europe in
1381. An 18th century water colour of the vase complete with its mounts exists, but the mounts
themselves were removed and lost in the 19th century. The vase is now in theÂ  National
Museum of Ireland . It is often held thatÂ  qingbai Â wares were not subject to the higher
standards and regulations of the other porcelain wares, since they were made for everyday
use. They were mass-produced, and received little attention from scholars andÂ 
antiquarians . The Fonthill Vase, given by a Chinese emperor to a pope, might appear to cast at
least some doubt on this view.

Kangxi Â period (1662 to 1722) blue and white porcelain tea caddy Main article:Â  Blue
and white porcelain

Following in the tradition of earlierÂ  qingbai Â porcelains, blue and white wares are
glazed using a transparentÂ  porcelain glaze . The blue decoration is painted onto the body
of the porcelain before glazing, using very finely groundÂ  cobalt oxide Â mixed with
water. After the decoration has been applied the pieces are glazed and fired.

It is believed that underglaze blue and white porcelain was first made in theÂ  Tang Dynasty
. Only three complete pieces of Tang blue and white porcelain are known to exist (in Singapore
from Indonesian Belitung shipwreck ), but shards dating to the 8th or 9th century have been
unearthed atÂ  Yangzhou Â in theÂ  Jiangsu province . It has been suggested that the
shards originated from a kiln in the province of Henan . In 1957, excavations at the site of
aÂ  pagoda Â in the provinceÂ  Zhejiang Â uncovered a Northern Song bowl decorated
with underglaze blue and further fragments have since been discovered at the same site. In
1970, a small fragment of a blue and white bowl, again dated to the 11th century, was also
excavated in the province of Zhejiang.

In 1975, shards decorated with underglaze blue were excavated at a kiln site inÂ  Jiangxi
Â and, in the same year, an underglaze blue and whiteÂ  urn Â was excavated from a tomb
dated to 1319, in the province ofÂ  Jiangsu . It is of interest to note that a YuanÂ 
funerary urn Â decorated with underglaze blue and underglaze red and dated 1338 is still in
the Chinese taste, even though by this time the large-scale production of blue and white
porcelain in theÂ  Yuan ,Â  Mongol Â taste had started its influence at Jingdezhen.

Starting early in the 14th century, blue and white porcelain rapidly became the main product
of Jingdezhen, reaching the height of its technical excellence during the later years of the
reign of theÂ  Kangxi Emperor [37] Â and continuing in present times to be an important
product of the city.

TheÂ  tea caddy Â illustrated shows many of the characteristics of blue and white
porcelain produced during the Kangxi period. The translucent body showing through the clear
glaze is of great whiteness and the cobalt decoration, applied in many layers, has a fine
blueÂ  hue . The decoration, a sage in a landscape of lakes and mountains withÂ  blazed
Â rocks is typical of the period. The piece would have been fired in a saggar Â (a lidded
ceramic box intended to protect the piece from kiln debris, smoke and cinders during firing)
in aÂ  reducing atmosphere Â in a wood-burningÂ  egg-shaped Â kiln, at a
temperature approaching 1350 Â°C.

Distinctive blue-and-white porcelain was exported to Japan where it is known asÂ  Tenkei
blue-and-white ware Â orÂ  ko sometsukei . This ware is thought to have been especially
ordered by tea masters forÂ  Japanese ceremony .

Blanc de Chine

Main article:Â  Blanc de Chine

Blanc de Chine Â is a type of white porcelain made atÂ  Dehua Â in theÂ  Fujian
Â province. It has been produced from theÂ  Ming Dynasty Â (1368â€“1644) to the
present day. Large quantities arrived in Europe Â asÂ  Chinese Export Porcelain Â in
the early 18th century and it was copied atÂ  Meissen Â and elsewhere.

The area along the Fujian coast was traditionally one of the main ceramic exporting centers.
Over one-hundred and eighty kiln sites have been identified extending in historical range
from the Song period to present.

Tripod Early 17th century, NantoyÅ�sÅ� Collection, Japan

From the Ming period porcelain objects were manufactured that achieved a fusion of glaze and
body traditionally referred to as â€œivory whiteâ€� and â€œmilk
white.â€� The special characteristic of Dehua porcelain is the very small amount of
iron oxide in it, allowing it to be fired in an oxidising atmosphere to a warm white or pale ivory
colour. (Wood, 2007)

The porcelain body is not very plastic but vessel forms have been made from it. Donnelly,
(1969, pp.xi-xii) lists the following types of product: figures, boxes, vases and jars, cups
and bowls, fishes, lamps, cup-stands, censers and flowerpots, animals, brush holders, wine
and teapots,Â  Buddhist Â andÂ  Taoist Â figures, secular figures and puppets.
There was a large output of figures, especially religious figures, e.g.Â  Guanyin ,Â 
Maitreya , Lohan Â and Ta-mo figures.

The numerous Dehua porcelain factories today make figures and tableware in modern styles.
During theÂ  Cultural Revolution Â â€�Dehua artisans applied their very best
skills to produce immaculate statuettes of the Great Leader and the heroes of the revolution.
Portraits of the stars of the new proletarian opera in their most famous roles were produced on
a truly massive scale.â€�Â  Mao Zedong Â figures later fell out of favour but have
been revived for foreign collectors.

Notable artists inÂ  blanc de Chine , such as the late Ming periodÂ  He Chaozong , signed
their creations with their seals. Wares include crisply modeled figures,Â  cups , bowls
and joss stick-holders.

Many of the best examples ofÂ  blanc de Chine Â are found in Japan where the white variety
was termedÂ  hakugorai Â or â€œKorean whiteâ€�, a term often found inÂ  tea
ceremony Â circles. TheÂ  British Museum Â in London has a large number ofÂ  blanc
de Chine Â pieces, having received as a gift in 1980 the entire collection of P.J.Donnelly.

Famille rose enamel ware allows a greater range of colour and tone than was previously
possible, enabling the depiction of more complex images, including flowers, figures and
insects.

It is made by drawing a sketch on the shaped clay, which is then covered with â€˜glassy

the mixture of pigment and oil, beforeÂ  firing .

Yixing ware

See also:Â  Yixing clay Â andÂ  Yixing clay teapot

Early pots were designed for travel use hence you will see the simple classical look of the pots
produced during the Ming Dynasty.Â  [40] Â Most tea drinking enthusiast will have one
teapot for travel use, these tend to be less expensive and compact in design. It was not until
during the mid-Qing Dynasty (18th century) that tea connoisseurs started to use the pot at
home and the artisan begin to form them into different shape and sizes. Many exotic forms were
conceived. Vessels were decorated with poetic inscriptions, calligraphy, paintings and
seals were incised onto the surface of the teapots.

    The term â€œ yixing clay â€� is often used as an umbrella term to describe
    several distinct types of clay used to make stoneware:

    - Zisha Â orÂ  Zini Â (çŽ«ç ‚ or çŽ«æ³¥Â ; literally,
    â€œpurple sand/clayâ€�): this stoneware has a purple-red-brown color.

    

    - Zhusha Â orÂ  Zhuni Â (æœ±ç ‚ or æœ±æ³¥; literally, â€œ
    cinnabar Â sand/clayâ€�): reddish brown stoneware with a very high iron
    content. The name only refers to the sometimes bright red hue of cinnabar
    (æœ±ç ‚; pinyin: zhÅ«shÄ�). Due to the increasing demand for Yixing
    stoneware, zhuni is now in very limited quantities. Zhuni clay is not to be confused with
    hongni (çº¢æ³¥, literally, â€œred clayâ€�, another red clay.

    

    - Duanni Â (é�›æ³¥; literally, â€œfortifed clayâ€�): stoneware
    that was formulated using various stones and minerals in addition to zini or zhuni clay.
    This results in various textures and colours, ranging from beige, blue, and green
    (ç»¿æ³¥), to black.

    Chinese potters have a long tradition of borrowing design and decorative features from
    earlier wares. Whilst ceramics with features thus borrowed might sometimes pose
    problems ofÂ  provenance , they would not generally be regarded as either
    reproductions or fakes. However, fakes and reproductions have also been made at many
    times during the long history of Chinese ceramics and continue to be made today in
    ever-increasing numbers.

    - Reproductions of Song dynastyÂ  Longquan celadon Â wares were made at Jingdezhen
    in the early 18th century, but outright fakes were also made using special clay that were
    artificially aged by boiling in meatÂ  broth , refiring and storage inÂ  sewers .
    PÃšre dâ€™Entrecolles records that by this means the wares could be passed off as
    being hundreds of years old.

    

    - At Jingdezhen, the two remaining wood fired, egg-shaped kilns produce convincing
    reproductions of earlier wares. At Zhejiang province good reproductions of Song
    Longquan celedon wares continue to be made in large, side-stoked dragon kilns.

    

    - BeforeÂ  World War II , the English potterÂ  Bernard Leach Â found what he took to
    be genuine Song dynastyÂ  cizhou Â rice-bowls being sold for very little money on
    the dock of a Chinese port and was surprised to learn that they were in fact newly made.

    

    - In the late 19th century, fakes of Kangxi periodÂ  famille noire Â wares were made
    that were convincing enough to deceive the experts of the day. Many such pieces may still
    be seen in museums today, as may pieces of genuine Kangxi porcelain decorated in the late
    nineteenth century withÂ  famille noire Â enamels. A body of modern expert opinion
    holds that porcelain decorated withÂ  famille noire Â enamels was not made at all
    during the Kangxi period, though this view is disputed.

    

    - A fashion for Kangxi period (1662 to 1722) blue and white wares grew to large proportions
    in Europe during the later years of the 19th century and triggered the production at
    Jingdezhen of large quantities of porcelain wares that strike a resemblance to ceramics
    of earlier periods. Such blue and white wares were not fakes or even convincing
    reproductions, even though some pieces carried four-character Kangxi reign-marks
    that continue to cause confusion to this day. Kangxi reign-marks in the form shown in the
    illustration occur only on wares made towards the end of the 19th century or later,
    without exception.

    



Authentication



The most widely-known test is theÂ  thermoluminescence Â test, or TL test, which is used
on some types of ceramic to estimate, roughly, the date of last firing. The TL test is carried
out on small samples of porcelain drilled or cut from the body of a piece, which can be risky and
disfiguring. For this reason, the test is rarely used for dating finely-potted, high-fired
ceramics. TL testing cannot be used at all on some types of porcelain items, particularly
high-fired porcelain.

Chinese influences on Islamic pottery

Chinese influences on Islamic pottery

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Chinese influences onÂ  Islamic pottery Â cover
a period starting from at least the 8th century CE to the 19th century.Â This influence
ofÂ  Chinese ceramics Â has to be viewed in the broader context of the considerable
importance of Chinese culture on Islamic arts in general.

Earliest exchanges



Early contacts with Central Asia

Eastern Zhou Â vase, thought to incorporate Western influences (3rd-4th century BCE).

Despite the distances involved, there is evidence of some contact between eastern and
southwestern Asia from antiquity. Some very early Western influence on Chinese pottery
seems to appear from the 3rd-4th century BCE. AnÂ  Eastern Zhou Â red earthenware bowl,
decorated with slip Â and inlaid with glass paste, and now in the British Museum, is thought
to have imitated metallic vessels, possibly of foreign origin. Foreign influence
especially is thought to have encouraged the Eastern Zhou interest in glass decorations.

Â Northern Qi earthenware with multicultural (Egyptian, Greek, Eurasian) motifs,
550-577.

Contacts between China Â and Central Asia were formally opened from the 2nd to 1st century
BCE through theÂ  Silk Road .Â In the following centuries, a great cultural influx
benefited China, embodied by the appearance in China of foreign art, new ideas and religions
(especiallyÂ  Buddhism ), and new lifestyles.Artistic influences combined a
multiplicity of cultures which had intermixed along the Silk Road, especiallyÂ 
Hellenistic ,Â  Egyptian ,Â  Indian Â and Central Asian Â cultures, displaying a
strong cosmopolitanism. Such mixed influences are especially visible in the earthenwares
of Northern China in the 6th century, such as those of theÂ  Northern Qi Â (550-577) or
theÂ  Northern Zhou Â (557-581).Â In that period, high quality high-fired
earthenware starts to appear, called the â€œjeweled typeâ€�, which
incorporatesÂ  lotuses Â from Buddhist art, as well as elements ofÂ  Sasanian
Â designs such as pearl roundels, lion masks or musicians and dancers.Â The best of
these ceramics use bluish green, yellow or olive glazes.

China and the Islamic world

Tang Dynasty Â earthenware fragment withÂ  sancai Â glaze, end of 7th-early 8th
century, excavated inÂ  Nishapur ,Â  Iran .

Direct contacts between the Muslim and Chinese worlds were marked by theÂ  Battle of Talas
Â in 751 inÂ  Central Asia . Muslim communities are known to have been present in China as
early as the 8th century CE, especially in commercial harbours such asÂ  Canton
Â andÂ  Hangzhou . From the 9th century onwards, Islamic merchants started to import
Chinese ceramics, which were at the core of theÂ  Indian Ocean Â luxury trade at that
time.Â These exotic objects were cherished in theÂ  Islamic world Â and also became
an inspiration for local potters. Archaeological finds ofÂ  Chinese pottery Â in
theÂ  Middle East Â go back to the 8th century, starting with Chinese pottery of theÂ 
Tang period Â (618-907).Remains ofÂ  Tang period Â (618-907) ceramics have been
found inÂ  Samarra Â andÂ  Ctesiphon Â in present-dayÂ  Iraq , as well as inÂ 
Nishapur Â in present-dayÂ  Iran .These include porcelaneous white wares from
Northern Chinese kilns, celadon-glazed stoneware originating in theÂ  Yue Â kilns of
NorthernÂ  Zhejiang , and the splashed stoneware of Changsha Â kilns inÂ  Hunan
Province . Chinese pottery was the object of gift-making in Islamic lands: the Islamic writer
Muhammad Ibn-al-Husain-Bahaki wrote in 1059 thatÂ  Ali Ibn Isa , the governor ofÂ 
Khurasan , presentedÂ  Harun al-Rashid , the Caliph, twenty pieces of Chinese imperial
porcelain, the like of which had never been at a caliphâ€™s court before, in addition to
2,000 other pieces of porcelainâ€�.

Tang Dynasty Â stoneware withÂ  celadon glaze Â (Yue ware), found inÂ  Samarra
,Â  Iraq .

Yue ware originated in theÂ  Yue Â kilns of NorthernÂ  Zhejiang , in the site ofÂ 
Jiyuan Â nearÂ  Shaoxing , anciently called â€œYuezhouâ€�
(è¶Šå·ž).Â Yue ware was first manufactured from the 2nd century CE, when it
consisted in some very precise imitations ofÂ  bronze Â vessels, many of which were
found in tombs of theÂ  Nanjing Â region.Â After this initial phase, Yue ware evolved
progressively into true ceramic form, and became a true medium of artistic
expression.Â Production in Jiyuan stopped in the 6th century, but expanded to various
areas of Zhejiang, especially around the shores of Shanglinhu in Yuyaoxian. Yue ware was
highly valued, and was used as tribute for the imperial court in northern China in the 9th
century. [9] Â Significantly, it was also used in Chinaâ€™s most reveredÂ  Famen
Temple Â inÂ  Shaanxi Province .Â Yue ware was exported to theÂ  Middle East
Â early on, and shards of Yue ware have been excavated inÂ  Samarra ,Â  Iraq , in an early
example of Chinese influences on Islamic pottery,as well as toÂ  East Asia Â andÂ 
South Asia Â as well asÂ  East Africa Â from the 8th to the 11th century.

Tang period Â earthenware shards with low-firedÂ  polychrome Â three-color sancai
Â glazes from the 9th century were exported to Middle-Eastern countries such asÂ  Iraq
Â andÂ  Egypt , and have been excavated inÂ  Samarra Â in present-dayÂ  Iraq
Â and inÂ  Nishapur Â in present-dayÂ  Iran .Â These Chinese styles were soon
adopted for localÂ  Middle-Eastern Â manufactures. Copies were made by Iraqi
craftsmen as soon as the 9th century CE. In order to imitate ChineseÂ  Sancai , lead glazes
were used on top of vessels coated with whiteÂ  slip Â and a colorless glaze. The coloured
lead glazes were then splashed on the surface, where they spread and mixed, according to
theÂ  slipware Â technique. Shapes were also imitated, such as the lobed dishes found in
Chinese Tang ceramics and silverware which were reproduced in Iraq during the 9-10th
century. Conversely, numerous Central Asian and Persian influences were at work in the
designs of ChineseÂ  sancai Â wares: pictures of Central Asian mounted warriors,
scenes representing Central Asian musicians, vases in the shape of Middle-EasternÂ 
ewers .

ware, probablyÂ  Iran , 14th century.

Soon after the sancai period, Chinese white ware ceramics also found their way to theÂ 
Islamic world ,Â and were immediately reproduced.Â The Chinese white ware was
actuallyÂ  porcelain , invented in the 9th century, and usedÂ  kaolin Â and
high-temperature firing,Â but Islamic workshops were unable to duplicate its
manufacture. Instead, they manufactured fine earthenware bowls with the desired shape, and
covered them with a white glaze renderedÂ  opaque Â by the addition ofÂ  tin , an early
example ofÂ  tin-glazing .Â The Chinese shapes were also reproduced, seemingly to pass
for China-made wares. In the 12th century, Islamic manufacturers further developedÂ 
stone-paste Â techniques in order to obtain hard bodies approximating the hardness
obtained by Chinese porcelain. This technique was used until the 18th century, when the
Europeans discovered the Chinese technique for high-firing porcelain clays.

Celadon ware



The Chinese fashion for turquoise, orÂ  celadon , ware was also transmitted to the Islamic
world, where it gave rise to productions usingÂ  turquoise Â glazing and fish motifs
identical to the ones used in China.

The technique ofÂ  cobalt blue Â decorations seems to have been invented in the Middle
East in the 9th century through decorative experimentation on white ware,Â and the
technique of blue-and-white ware was developed in China in the 14th century.On some
occasions, Chinese blue and white wares also incorporated Islamic designs, as in the case of
some Mamluk brass works which were converted into blue and white Chinese porcelain designs.
[3] Chinese blue and white ware then became extremely popular in the Middle East, where both
Chinese and Islamic types coexisted. From the 13th century, Chinese pictorial designs, such
as flyingÂ  cranes ,Â  dragons Â andÂ  lotus flowers also started to appear in the
ceramic productions of the Near East, especially inÂ  Syria Â and Egypt .

The Secret of The Tang Treasure Ship at Belitung â€“ Indonesia



Belitung shipwreck

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia and others.

TheÂ  Belitung shipwreck Â (also called theÂ  Tang shipwreck Â orÂ  Batu Hitam
shipwreck ) is the wreck of an ArabianÂ  dhow Â which sailed a route from Africa to China
around 830 AD.



Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Dhow_Indian_Ocean.jpg/800px-Dhow_Indian_Ocean.jpg

A dhow in the Indian Ocean near the East African islands ofÂ  Zanzibar

The ship completed the outward journey but sank on the return journey, approximately 1 mile
(1.6Â km) off the coast ofÂ  Belitung Island ,Â  Indonesia . It is unclear why the ship
was so far from its expected route back from China.Â Belitung is to the south-east of the
Singapore Strait by 380 miles (610Â km), and this secondary route is more normal for ships
travelling from theÂ  Java Sea , which is south of Belitung Island.

The wreck has given archaeologists two major discoveries: the biggest single collection
ofÂ  Tang Dynasty Â artefacts found in one location, the so called â€œTang
Treasureâ€�; and the Arabian dhow, which gives a new insight into the trade routes
between China and the Middle East during that period. The treasure has been kept as one
collection and, during the excavation, the efforts to preserve the integrity of the site and
its cargo have resulted in detailed archaeological evidence. This evidence has given new
insight into the construction methods used in shipbuilding, and the items and style of
artefacts has revealed previously unknown facts about the trade between the two areas.

The wreck was discovered by fishermen in 1998 in the Gelasa Strait Â in 51 feet (16Â m) of
water.Â The site location was purchased from local fishermenÂ and a license to engage
in excavation was awarded to a local Indonesian company.Â The dig was subsequently
financed and excavated by Tilman Walterfang and his team at Seabed Explorations, under a
license of co-operation with the original salvage company,Â and after a request from the
Indonesian Government and security was provided by the Indonesian Navy.Â The
excavations spanned two expeditions, one which commenced in August 1998 and the second in
1999.Â Seabed Explorations provided vessels and financed government naval operations
to safeguard the wreck site before and during theÂ  monsoon season .

Route



It is unclear why the ship was so far from its expected route (shown in red on the map to the
right),Â as most ships leaving China for Arabia would have sailed through theÂ  South
China Sea . They would then turn north-west after passing southernÂ  Vietnam , continuing
through the Singapore Strait Â into theÂ  Straits of Malacca Â betweenÂ 
Peninsular Malaysia Â andÂ  Sumatra . Belitung is some distance from this route, and it
is unclear how the vessel came to be in this area. Belitung is to the south-east of the Singapore
Strait by 380 miles (610Â km), and this secondary route is more normal for ships travelling
from theÂ  Java Sea , which is south of Belitung Island, to the Strait of Malacca 380 miles
(610Â km) north of the Island.

Archaeologist Michael Fleckerâ€™s team found thousands of ceramic bowls neatly
stacked on the ocean floor. Some were looted by local fishermen between excavation seasons.

Ship and construction



Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Sur-Dhow_%284%29.JPG/800px-Sur-Dhow_%284%29.JPG

The shipwreck is of a dhow similar in size and construction to this one, in Oman.

The shipwrecked dhow was approximately 21 feet (6.4Â m) wide and 58 feet (18Â m)
longÂ and is remarkable for two reasons; it is the first ancient Arabian ship to be found and
excavated,Â and its planks were sewn together using a thin rope made ofÂ  coconut fibres
rather than using the more traditional methods of pegs or nails used in Arabia in later
centuries.

The wreck timbers were found under a sediment that preserved the remains of the wooden vessel,
without which the wreck would have been lost due toÂ  marine worms .Â Wrecks of this age
are rare finds and this particular one was in such a good condition that much of the hull was
preserved.Â This has given us an insight into how ships of this period were
constructedâ€”something which has not been seen before as no Arabian ship of this type
had previously been found, nor any with their cargo intact.

Pieces of the original timbers were preserved enough to allow scientists to analyse them and
determine some of theÂ  types of wood Â used. It is possible that the ship was constructed
in western Asia and bought by Arabian merchants to be used for the Oman to China route; the cargo
contains many Arabian-inspired artefacts.

Construction techniques



The ship was constructed around a 50.2 feet (15.3Â m) longÂ  keel Â of
14â€“15-centimetre (5.5â€“5.9 in) thickness, which is believed to have
survived intact.Â The front of the ship had a 61Â°Â  angle of rake Â at theÂ  bow
Â where theÂ  stem post Â was joined to the keel withÂ  mortise and tenon Â joints
and secured with 16-millimetre (0.63Â in) diameter rope.Â The hull planks were
stitched onto theÂ  frames Â and keel through holes spaced at 5â€“6-centimetre
(2.0â€“2.4 in) intervals.Â The boat had aÂ  keelson Â for added strength,
which rested on the half-frames.

Michael Flecker, the chief excavating archaeologist at the site, compared the wrecked ship
to three types of the same period and concluded that the wreck most resembled
â€œlashed-lugâ€� ships of south-east Asiaâ€”first used in the 5th
century.Â He said that fully stitched boats were found from the African coast, Oman, in the
Red Sea, on the Indian coast, and as far as the Maldives.Â He notes that Roman references by
Procopius Â in the 6th century tell of boats with planks stitched together in a similar
fashion used in â€œIndian Seasâ€�.Â Though Arabian ships of this type have not
been found before, they are mentioned in text including the late-TangÂ  Ling biao lu yi
Â (â€œStrange Things Noted in the Southâ€�). According to John Guy, curator of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the book â€œdescribes the ships of foreign merchants as
being stitched together with the fiber of coir-palms and having their seams caulked rather
than using iron nails to secure their planksâ€�

Wood types



Samples of wood from the shipwreck were sent for analysis at the Forest and Forest Products
division of theÂ  Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
Â (CSIRO) in Australia.Â The analysis was conducted by Jugo Ilic of CSIRO, a wood
identification specialist. Many of the samples were too badly deteriorated to be positively
identified, as the lack of cellulose remaining in the wood cells prevented successful
analysis.

There are many types of wood that have been positively identified: teak ( Tectona grandis ) was
used for the through-beams and is resilient to theÂ  teredo worm Â (the Teredinidae
family), the ceiling was made from aÂ  Cupressus Â genus which was possiblyÂ 
Cupressus torulosa , the stem-post is made ofÂ  rosewood Â from theÂ  Leguminosae
Â family (now called the Fabaceae) and either theÂ  Dalbergia Â orÂ  Pterocarpus
Â genus. The wooden box found in the stern area of the shipwreck was made from anÂ 
Artocarpus Â genus of theÂ  Moraceae Â family, more commonly known as theÂ 
Mulberry Â family.

The species used for the hull planks was not positively identified but is thought to beÂ 
Amoora Â of theÂ  Meliaceae Â family. The timber for the frames was similarly not
definitively determined, although one frame was probably ofÂ  Amoora Â or of theÂ 
Afzelia Â genus of the Fabaceae family.Â  Afzelia Â is interesting in that the three
main speciesÂ  A. africana ,Â  A. bipindensis Â andÂ  A. pachyloba Â are mostly
found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards
the west coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles.

The ship could originally have been said to be of Arabian or Indian origin, as there is little to
differentiate between ships of the area during that period, in regard to construction
techniquesâ€”though its frame uses a species of tree that is only found in a small part of
Africa.After analysing the hull form, timber species, and construction methods, Ilic
concluded that the wreck was of Indian or Arabian origin. India was considered the more
probable place of construction but Arabian construction was not ruled out, as the timber used
was commonly imported to the Middle East for use in shipbuilding.Â Flecker concluded that
the wreck was an Arabian ship in his 2010 chapter from the Sackler exhibition catalogue,
arguing that â€œfrom an analysis of construction methods and materials and hull form,
the author has determined that the Belitung wreck is an Arab vessel.

Legacy



Present-day knowledge of the original materials and methods used in construction of this
particular Arab dhow stems largely from the shipwreck itself. TheÂ  Jewel of Muscat
Â reconstruction, a replica made as an exact copy of the wreck, has shown that the ship
resembles a baitl qarib , a type of ship still found in Oman today.Â Amongst the hull of the
shipwreck were large lumps of concretion containing artefacts from the shipâ€™s cargo
dated to theÂ  Tang Dynasty Â of China around 800 AD, and from where the wreck gets its
other names, the â€œTang shipwreckâ€� or â€œTang treasure shipâ€�.

The shipâ€™s timbers and artefacts were shown to the public for the first time in 2011.
The world debut exhibition of the collection of artefacts, as well as timbers from the ship,
took place in theÂ  ArtScience Museum , adjacent to Singaporeâ€™sÂ  Marina Bay
Sands .Â The significance of the discovery of the shipwreck led to the decision to
construct theÂ  Jewel of Muscat Â as an exact reconstruction of the shipwrecked dhow.

Cargo and â€œTang treasureâ€�

See also:Â  Chinese ceramics Â andÂ  Chinese influences on Islamic pottery

The wreck held three main types of â€œwaresâ€� in the form of bowls:Â  Changsha
ware , the majority of the 60,000 items, were originally packed in either straw cylinders or
â€œDusunâ€� storage jars;Â  White-ware , manufactured in theÂ  Ding kilns
Â and including the earliest known intact underglaze blue and white
Â dishes;Â andÂ  Yue ware Â fromÂ  Zhejiang Province .Â OneÂ  Changsha
Â bowl was inscribed with a date: â€œ16th day of the seventh month of the second year of
the Baoli reignâ€�, or 826 AD. This was later confirmed byÂ  radiocarbon dating
Â ofÂ  star anise Â found amongst the wreck.Â The cargo had a surprising variety of
influences and markets, includingÂ  Buddhist lotus Â  symbols , motifs from Central
Asia and Persia,Â  Koranic Â  inscriptions , andÂ  green-splashed Â bowls popular
inÂ  Iran .

Included in the cargo were items of varying purposes, from spice jars andÂ  ewers
Â toÂ  inkwells , funeral urns andÂ  gilt-silver boxes .Â The cargo was described
by John Guy of theÂ  Metropolitan Museum of Art Â in New York as â€œthe richest and
largest consignment of early ninth-century southern Chinese gold and ceramics ever
discovered in a single hoard.Â The cargo also included spices and resin, and metal ingots
used as ballast. There were also special items found which include a gold cupâ€”the
largest Tang dynasty gold cup ever foundâ€”and a large silver flask decorated with a
pair of ducks.Â The gold cup has pictures of people in various actions on its sides, such as
musicians and a Persian dancer. It also has images of two men on its thumb plate with features
that appear to be non-Chinese, as they are depicted with curly hair.

Tilman Walterfangâ€™s company formed a contract of cooperation with the original
Indonesian salvage companyÂ and as a result the cargo was not sold off piece by piece to
collectors. Although there were instances of some looting from the site, particularly
between the two excavation periods,Â Walterfang kept the cargo intact as one complete
collection so that it could be studied in its original context; something which has given an
â€œunparalleled insight into Chinaâ€™s industrial capacity and global
tradeâ€� according to Julian Raby, director of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery.Â It
was housed in a private conservation facility for six years, where the artefacts were
painstakinglyÂ  conserved Â (includingÂ  desalination ), studied, and carefully
restored by Walterfangâ€™s company, Seabed Explorations Ltd. of New Zealand.Â The
work was carried out with the assistance of German conservator Andreas Rettel,Â who
trained at theÂ  RÃ¶misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Â inÂ  Mainz . The
artefacts were authenticated by Professor Geng Baochang, senior research fellow at theÂ 
Palace Museum Â in Beijing. Baochang is the deputy director ofÂ  Beijing â€˜sÂ 
Forbidden City Â and one of Chinaâ€™s foremost experts on antique ceramics.

The cargo was purchased for around 32 millionÂ  USD Â by a private company, the Sentosa
Leisure Group, and the Singaporean government in 2005, and loaned to the Singapore Tourism
Board.

The debut exhibit of the treasure ran from 19 February 2011 to 31 July 2011 at theÂ 
ArtScience Museum Â in Singapore.Â The display was put on with the collaboration of
theÂ  Smithsonian Institution , The Freer Gallery of Art, the Arthur M.Â  Sackler
Gallery , theÂ  Singapore Tourism Board , and the National Heritage Board of
Singapore.Â The exhibition is then scheduled to travel the world for approximately five
years, to venues which include museums of major importance throughout Asia, Australia,
Europe, the Middle East, and the United States.

Controversy



TheÂ  Sackler Gallery , part of the Smithsonian Institution, was due to host the US premiere
exhibition of the Belitung cargo in early 2012â€”a date set to coincide with the
Smithsonian museumâ€™s 25th anniversary celebration.Â On 28 June 2011 it was
reported that the museum was postponing the show.Â The Sackler Gallery has received
condemnation of the exhibition due to the time-frame and nature of the original excavation of
the artefacts; with arguments put forwards about whether the display should be allowed.
According toÂ  The New York Times , â€œa group of archaeologists and anthropologists
from the National Academy of Sciences â€” including Robert McCormick Adams, a former
leader of the Smithsonianâ€� wrote to the head of the Smithsonian Institution, G.Wayne
Clough, on 5 April 2011 claiming that â€œproceeding with the exhibition would
â€˜severely damage the stature and reputationâ€™ of the
institution.Â Proponents of the arguments against display say that the excavation was
for commercial gain and conducted so quickly as to have caused a loss of information
pertaining to the crew and cargo.TheÂ  New York Times Â article goes on to say that
further comments were made by â€œthe Society for American Archaeology, the Council of
American Maritime Museums and the International Committee for Underwater Cultural
Heritage, as well as groups within the Smithsonian, including the members of the
anthropology department and the Senate of Scientists at its National Museum of Natural
Historyâ€� all asking that the Smithsonian reconsider the exhibition.Â There are
also claims that exhibiting the artefacts would be against international agreements on
underwater excavations. Kimberly L. Faulk, a marine archaeologist and vice chairwoman of
the non-governmental Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology said that, â€œby
proceeding with the exhibition the Smithsonian â€” which is a research institution as
well as a network of museums â€” would be violating its own set of professional ethics and
promoting the looting of archaeological sites.

Proponents of the arguments to display the works claim that the excavation was indeed legal as
the work was carried out in accordance with Indonesian law, at the request of the Indonesian
government, and in accordance with international laws at the time.Â James P. Delgado,
director of maritime heritage at the United States Department of Commerce National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, said that â€œallowing any of the finds from an
excavation to be sold betrays the most basic aspects of researchâ€� with theÂ  New
York TImes Â going on to report that, â€œhe [Delgado] wished the Belitung shipwreck
had been academically excavated. But unlike some of his colleagues, he said that instead of
canceling the exhibition, the Smithsonian could use it to educate the public about the
consequences of the commercialization of underwater heritage.

Â flowers.

Walterfang has stated that â€œthe overall situation would without doubt be described as
â€˜less than idealâ€™Â and that â€œthe Indonesian government, fearful of
looting, ordered Seabed Explorations to begin an immediate round-the-clock recovery
operation.

Some academics have expressed more definitive support for Tilman Walterfangâ€™s
excavation and treatment of the Belitung vessel and cargo.

Lu Caixa, a researcher at theÂ  Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore , states
in the newsletter of the International Institute for Asian Studies, Leiden, Netherland,
that â€œthe excavation of the Belitung has been acknowledged as an admirable example of
what can be achieved under difficult conditions in Southeast Asia.â€� She points out
that unlike some other commercial operators, Walterfangâ€™s company ensured that
â€œthe ship structure itself was properly recorded, the cargo was kept together rather
than dispersed, and the finds were well conserved, studied, catalogued, and
published.â€� Caixa ends by highlighting the efficacy of the public-private
arrangement: â€œIt is difficult to imagine how this particular project could have been
financed or organized without commercial involvement.

Prof. Victor H. Mair , Professor of Chinese Language and Literature in the Department of East
Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United
States defends the Smithsonian exhibition, claiming that the â€œeducational and
historical value of the collection is simply enormous, and those who have called for the
cancellation of the exhibition are, in effect and in fact, denying access to the wealth of
information embodied in the Belitung shipwreck, both to the lay public and to qualified
researchers.

Dr. Sean Kingsley, Director of Wreck Watch International reminds that â€œWrecks like
these should be â€˜feel goodâ€™ factors at times when the world has very serious and
painful natural, economic and civil disasters to contend withâ€� and â€œit hardly
needs stating that no European and American museum collection is whiter than white.

In an interview with the Science JournalÂ  G. Wayne Clough , the 12th secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution assuaged the animosities between critics and proponents of the
exhibition: â€œSo I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything negative here. I think
the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come
together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds
changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think itâ€™s time in a situation
like this to pause, and for the profession itself to say, â€œOkay, thereâ€™s a
problem, what are you going to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed
the UNESCO treaty.

Conventions by international organisations



The Underwater Archaeology Resolutions that were adopted on 10 September 1993 by the
International Congress of Maritime Museums (ICMM) state that: ICMM member museums should
follow the Council of American Maritime Museums (CAMM) policy and â€˜â€Šnot
knowingly acquire or exhibit artifacts which have been stolen, illegally exported from
their country of origin, illegally salvaged, or removed from commercially exploited
archaeological or historic sitesâ€™ in recent times (ie. since the 1990 full Congress
of ICMM).â€� â€”International Congress of Maritime Museums

They also say that, â€œICMM members should recognize that artefacts from underwater
sites are integral parts of archaeological assemblages, which should remain intact for
research and displayâ€� and that, â€œa commercially exploited heritage site is
one in which the primary motive for investigation is private financial
gain.â€�Â The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) ratified a set of rules for preserving and excavating underwater sites at the
Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage during 15 October â€”
5 November 2001.Though the rules set out at the meeting do include preserving artefactsÂ 
in situ Â as the preferable option they go on to say: The commercial exploitation of
underwater cultural heritage for trade or speculation or its irretrievable dispersal is
fundamentally incompatible with the protection and proper management of underwater
cultural heritage. Underwater cultural heritage shall not be traded, sold, bought or
bartered as commercial goods. This Rule cannot be interpreted as preventing:(a) the
provision of professional archaeological services or necessary services incidental
thereto whose nature and purpose are in fullconformity with this Convention and are subject
to the authorization of the competent authorities;  â€”UNESCO

TheÂ  Longmen Grottoes Â ( simplified Chinese
:Â éŸ™é—šçŸ³çªŸ;Â  traditional Chinese
:Â éŸ�é–€çŸ³çªŸ; pinyin :Â  lÃ³ngmÃ©n shÃ­kÅ« ; lit.Â 
Dragonâ€™s Gate Grottoes ) orÂ  Longmen Caves Â are one of the finest examples
ofÂ  Chinese Buddhist art . Housing tens of thousands of statues ofÂ  Buddha and his
disciples, they are located 12 kilometres (7.5Â mi) south of present dayÂ 
LuÃ²yÃ¡ng Â in HÃ©nÃ¡n Â province,Â  Peoples Republic of China . The
images, many once painted, were carved into caves excavated from theÂ  limestone
Â cliffs of the Xiangshan andÂ  Longmenshan mountains, running east and west. TheÂ 
Yi River Â flows northward between them and the area used to be calledÂ  Yique
Â (â€œThe Gate of the Yi Riverâ€�).Â The alternative name of
â€œDragonâ€™s Gate Grottoesâ€� derives from the resemblance of the two
hills that check the flow of the Yi River to the typical â€œ Chinese gate
Â towersâ€� that once marked the entrance to Luoyang from the south.

There are as many as 100,000 statues within the 1,400 caves, ranging from an 1 inch (25Â mm)
to 57 feet (17Â m) in height. The area also contains nearly 2,500Â  stelae Â and
inscriptions , whence the name â€œForest of Ancient Stelaeâ€�, as well as over
sixtyÂ  Buddhist pagodas . Situated in a scenic natural environment, the caves were dug
from a 1 kilometre (0.62Â mi) stretch of cliff running along both banks of the river. 30%
date from theÂ  Northern Wei Dynasty Â and 60% from theÂ  Tang , caves from other
periods accounting for less than 10% of the total.Starting with the Northern Wei Dynasty in
493 AD, patrons and donors included emperors,Â  Wu Zetian Â of the Tang dynasty, members
of the royal family, other rich families, generals, and religious groups.

In 2000 the site was inscribed upon theÂ  UNESCO Â  World Heritage List Â as â€œan
outstanding manifestation of human artistic creativity,â€� for its perfection of an
art form, and for its encapsulation of the cultural sophistication of Tang China.

Geography

Mt. Longmen as seen from Manshui Bridge to the southeast. May, 2004.

This complex is one of the three notable grottoes inÂ  China , which is 12Â km to the south
of Luyong. The other two grottoes are theÂ  Yungang Caves Â nearÂ  Datong Â inÂ 
Shanxi Province , and theÂ  Mogao Caves Â nearÂ  Dunhuang Â inÂ  Gansu Province
Â in west China. The valley formed by the Yi River enclosed by two hills ranges of Xiangshan
(to the east) and Longmenshan (to the west) hills have steep slopes on the western and eastern
slopes along the river. Yi is a north flowing tributary of theÂ  Luo River . The grottoes are
formed in 1Â km of the stretch of this river and were carved on both banks, in limestone
formations creating the â€œLongmanâ€™s Cavesâ€�. Most of the work was done
on the western bank, while the eastern bank caves, of smaller numbers, served as residences
for the large groups of monks.

Within the approximately 1,400 caves, there are 100,000 statues, some of which are only 1 inch
(25Â mm) high,while the largest Buddha statue is 57 feet (17Â m) in height.Â There
are also approximately 2500 stellas and 60 pagodas. The grottoes are located on both sides of
the Yi River. Fifty large and medium sized caves are seen on the west hill cliffs which are
credited to the Northern, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, while the caves on the east hill were carved
entirely during the Tang Dynasty.Â The plethora of caves, sculptures and pagodas in
Longmen Grottoes depict a definite â€œprogression in styleâ€� with the early
caves being simple and well shaped with carvings of statues of Buddha and religious people.
The change of style is more distinct in the Tang Dynastic periods which are â€œmore
complex and incorporate women and court figures as wellâ€�. The caves have been
numbered sequentially from north to south along the west bank of the Yi River. Entry to the
caves is from the northern end.

History



Early history



The earliest history of the creation of Longmen Grottoes is traced to the reign ofÂ  Emperor
Xiaowen of Northern Wei Â dynasty when he shifted his capital to Luyong from DÃ tÃ³ng;
Luyongâ€™s symbolic value is borne by the fact that it served as the historic capital for
13 dynasties. The grottoes were excavated and carved with Buddhist subjects over the period
from 493 AD to 1127 AD, in four distinct phases. The first phase started with the Northern Wei
dynasty (493 and 534). The second phase saw slow development of caves as there was
interruption due to strife in the region, between 524 and 626, during the reign of theÂ  Sui
dynasty Â (581-618) and the early part of the Tang dynasty] (618-907). The third phase, was
during the reign of the Tang dynasty whenÂ  Chinese Buddhism Â flourished and there was a
proliferation of caves and carvings from the 5th century to the mid 8th century. The last
phase, which was the fourth, was from the later part of the Tang dynastic rule extending to
theÂ  Northern Song Dynasty Â rule, which saw a decline in the creation of grottoes. It
came to an end due to internecine war between theÂ  Jin andÂ  Yuan dynasties .

Guyangdong or the Shiku Temple, credited to Emperor Xiaowen, was the first cave temple to be
built at the center of the southern floor of the West Hill. Xiaowen followed up this activity
and excavated three more caves, two in memory of his father and one in memory of his mother; all
three caves are grouped under the title of the â€œThree Binyang Cavesâ€�
(Binyangsandong), which were built by the emperor over a 24-year period. Over 30% of the caves
seen now were built during this period.

In 527, the Huangfugong or Shikusi grottoes, a major cave, was completed. It is a well
conserved cave located to the south of the West Hill.

In 675, Fengxiansi Cave, on the southern floor of the West Hill was completed during the Tang
dynasty rule. This marked the third phase of creation and the peak period of the
gottoesâ€™ creation. It is estimated that 60% of the caves seen at Longmen came about in
this period from 626 till 755. During this period, in addition to the caves which housed Buddha
statues of various sizes, some Buddhist temples were also built in open spaces with scenic
settings in the same complex. However, these are now mostly in ruins. During this phase,Â 
Emperor Gaozong Â and Empress Wu Zetian were instrumental in intensifying the activity
when they were ruling from Luyong.

Later history



During the period of 1368 to 1912, when two dynasties ruled in China, namely the Ming dynasty
from 1368 to 1644, and theÂ  Qing Dynasty Â from 1644â€“1912, there was cultural
revival and the Longmen Grottoes received recognition both at the national and
international level.

During the Second Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese looted the site and took many of the statues
back to Japan. Many of these relics are now in Japanese museums.

Vandalism occurred in the 1940s, a result of political unrest. With the establishment of the
Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1949, the grottoes have been declared as protected area
and are being conserved. TheÂ  Constitution of China , under Article 22, which among other
issues also provides for protection of the natural heritage sites, has been further defined
under various legal instruments enacted to protect and conserve this cultural heritage of
China.

The Longmen Relics Care Agency was established in 1953 under the Ministry of Culture.Â A
1954 site inventory was undertaken by the newly established Longmen Caves Cultural Relics
Management and Conservation Office. The State Council declared the Longmen Grottoes as a
national cultural monument needing special protection in 1961. In 1982, it was declared as
one of the first group of scenic zones to be protected at the state level.Â The Management
and Conservation Office was renamed the Longmen Grottoes Research Institute in 1990; and the
Peopleâ€™s Government of Luoyang City became responsible for the management of the
heritage monuments.Â The governing organization was renamed the Longmen Grottoes
Research Academy in 2002.

During theÂ  Warring States Period , the generalÂ  Bai Qi Â ofÂ  Qin Â once
defeated the allied forces ofÂ  Han Â andÂ  Wei Â at the site. The site was subjected
to significant vandalism at several points in its history. Major artifacts were removed by
Western collectors and souvenir hunters during the early 20th century. The heads of many
statues were also destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Two murals taken from the
grottoes are reported to be displayed in theÂ  Metropolitan Museum of Art Â inÂ  New
York Â and theÂ  Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art Â inÂ  Kansas City, Missouri .

Massive Buddhist sculptures in the main grotto.

There are several the major grottoes with notable displays of Buddhist sculptures and
calligraphic inscriptions.Â Some of the main caves and the year when work began within
them include: Guyang-dong (493), Binyang-dong (505), Lianhua-dong (520s), Weizi-dong
(522), Shiku-si (520s), Weizi-dong (520s), Shisku (520s), Yaofang-dong (570),
Zhaifu-dong (ca. 636), Huijian-dong (630s), Fahua-dong (650s), Fengxian-si (672),
Wanfo-si (670-680s), Jinan-dong (684), Ganjing-si (684), and Leigutai-dong
(684).Â The Guyang, Binyang, and Linahua caves are hoseshoe-shaped.

Guyangdong



Guyangdong, or Guyang Cave, or Old Sun Cave, is recorded as the oldest Longmen cave with
carvings in the Northern Wei style. It is also the largest cave, located in the central part of
the west hill. It was carved under the orders of Emperor Xiaowen. The earliest carving in this
limestone cave has been now predated to 478 AD, which has been inferred as the time taken by
Emperor Xiaowen to shift his capital from Datong to Luyoon have very well sculpted Buddhist
statues in niches in this cave. Also found here are 600 inscriptions in fine calligraphy of the
writings of the Northern Wei style.Â Many of the sculptures inside the cave were also
contributed by royal people; religious groups supported this activity. The cave has three
very large images â€“ the central image is of Sakyamuni Buddha Â withÂ 
Bodhisattvas Â on either side. The features of the images are indicative of the Northern
Wei style, typically of slim and emaciated figures. There are about 800 inscriptions in the
walls and niches inside the cave, the largest such numbers in any cave in China.There are two
rows of niches on the northern and southern walls of the cave, which house a very large number of
images; the artists have recorded their names with dates giving reasons for carving them. A
score of important ancient calligraphic inscriptions are also seen.Â The Guyang,
Binyang, and Linahua caves are hoseshoe-shaped.

Binyang



    Binyang has three caves of which the Middle Binyang Cave is the most prominent

South wall ofÂ  Middle Binyang Cave

    Binyangzhongdong or theÂ  Middle Binyang Cave , is carved in the Datang style on the
    west hill, on the northern floor. It was built by Emperor Xuanwun to commemorate his
    father Xiaowe, and also his mother. It is said that 800,000 workers created it over the
    period from 500 to 523. In the main wall of this cave, five very large Buddhist statues are
    carved all in Northern Wei style The central statue is of Sakyamuni Buddha with four
    images of Bodhisattvas flanking it. Two side walls also have Buddha images flanked by
    Bodhisatvas. The Buddhas, arranged in three groups in the cave, are representative of
    Buddha of the past, the present, and the future. The canopy in the roof is designed as aÂ 
    lotus flower . There were reportedly two largeÂ  bas-reliefs Â showing the Emperor
    and the Empress in worship which were pilfered and now stated to be in a museum in the USA.
    While a few statues are sculpted with â€œlong features, thin faces, fishtail robes
    and traces of Greek influenceâ€�, others are in Tang period natural style and
    heavily built.

        Binyangnandong

    



Binyangnandong, or theÂ  South Binyang Cave , has five very large images which were carved
byÂ  Li Tai , the fourth son ofÂ  Li Shimin , the first Tang Emperor. He made them in 641 AD in
memory of his mother EmpressÂ  Zhangsun . The central image in in a serene appearance is that
of Amitabha Buddha Â seated on a pedestal surrounded by Bodhisattvas, also serene looking
in blend of the Northern Wei and the Tang Dynasty styles.

The Big Vairocana of Longmen Buddha Grottoes

Fengxian , or Feng Xian Si, or Li Zhi cave is the Ancestor Worshipping Cave, which is the largest
of all caves carved on the west hill built between 672 and 676 for Empress Wu Zetian. The
carvings are claimed to be the ultimate in architectural perfection of the Tang dynasty. The
shrine inside the cave measures 39m x35m. It has the largest Buddha statue at the Longmen
Grottoes.Â Of the nine huge carved statues, the highly impressive image ofÂ  Vairocana
Buddha Â is sculpted on the back wall of the Fengxian. The image is 17.14m high and has 2m long
ears.Â An inscription at the base of this figure gives 676 as the year of carving.
Bodhisattva on the left of the main image of Buddha is decorated with a crown and pearls. Also
shown is a divine person trampling an evil spirit. The main image of Vairochanaâ€™s
features are plumpish and of peaceful and natural expression. Each of the other large statues
are carved with expressions matching their representative roles. These were carved at the
orders of Empress Wu Zetian, and are considered uniquely representative of the Tang
dynastyâ€™s â€œvigorous, elegant and realistic style.â€� The huge
Virochana statue is considered as â€œthe quintessence of Buddhist sculpture in China.

The Vairochana statue also provides information at its base of the names of the artisans who
worked here, the donorâ€™s name namely the Emperor Gaozong, and also honors Wu Zetian.
It is said that Wu Zetian donated â€œtwenty-thousand strings of her rouge and powder
moneyâ€� to complete this edifice. Hence, it is conjectured that the Vairocana Buddha
was carved to resemble the Empress herself and termed as a â€œChinese Mona Lisa, Venus or
as the Mother of Chinaâ€�. All the images here, which remain undamaged, project a detail
of character and animation. Statues of Kasyapa Â andÂ  Ananda , the two principal
disciples of Vairochana and two Bodhisattvas with crowns flank the main statue, apart from
numerous images of â€œlokapalas (guardians or heavenly kings), dvarapalas (temple
guards), flying divas and numerous other figures.â€�

Others

    

        Huangfugong

    



    Huangfugong, or Shikusi, a three-wall, three-niche cave,Â is situated south of the
    west hill, was carved out in 527. It was completed at one stretch as a single unit and is very
    well preserved. There are seven Buddhas carved on theÂ  lintel Â which give the
    appearance of a wood finish. Seven very large images are seen in the main hall with Buddha
    image flanked by two Bodhisattvas and two disciples. Also seen are images of Buddhist
    groups in the niches of the cave. A very large design of lotus flower is carved in the roof
    flanked by eight musical apsaras (water spirits or nymphs).Â It was created by
    Huangfu Du, uncle ofÂ  Empress Hu

        Wan-fo-tung

    



    Wan-fo-tung (â€œCave of Ten Thousand Buddhasâ€�), or Yung-lung-tung, [13]
    Â was built in 680 by Gaozong and Wu Zetian. It houses 15,000 Buddhas carved in small
    niches, different from each other, with the smallest Buddha being 2 centimetres
    (0.79Â in) in height.

        Yaofangdong

    



    Yaofangdong, or the Medical Prescription Cave, has small inscriptionsÂ of 140
    medical prescriptions for a wide range medical problems such as common cold to insanity.
    These are seen carved right at the entrance on both walls These carvings are dated from the
    late Northern Wei period right through to the early Tang Dynasty.

Detail of Vairocana

    Reached by modern, concrete stairs up the face of a cliff, Qianxisi, or Hidden Stream
    Temple Cave, is a large cave on the northern edge of the west hill. Made during
    Gaozongâ€™s reign (653-80), the cave has statues of a huge, seated, early Tang
    BuddhaÂ (Amitabha Buddha),Â  Avalokitesvara and ahasthamaprapta flanked by
    Bodhisattvas, and are carved with a sophisticated expression typical of Tang
    style.Â It may have been sponsored by the Nanping princess, with the beneficiary
    being Gaozong, her recently deceased father.

        Lianhua

    



    The Lianhua or the Lotus Flower Cave, dated to 521, belongs to be the Northern Wei period.
    The Grotto has a large lotus flower carved in high relief on its ceiling. Several small
    Buddhas are carved into the south wall. Also seen are shrines in the south and north wall in
    the niches.

        Laolong

    



The Laolong or the Old Dragon Cave created during the Tang Dynasty period, named after the Old
Dragon Palace has many niches dated to Gaozongâ€™s reign.

Temples



There are the several temples at Longmen Grottoes. Some important ones include Xiangshan
temple, Bai Garden temple, and the Tomb of Bai Juyi.Â Others are Tongle temple, begun under
Emperor Mingyuan; Lingyan and Huguo temples, under Emperor Wencheng; Giangong temple,
under Xiaowen; and Chongfu temple, under Quianar.

Xiangshan temple



Xiangshan Temple is one of the earliest of the ten temples at Longmen. It is located in the mid
section of the east hill. The name â€˜Xiangshanâ€™ is derived from the name of the
spices â€œXianggeâ€� found extensively on these hill slopes. It was
reconstructed some time in 1707, during the reign of the Qing Dynasty patterned on an old
temple that existed there. Longmen Grottoes Administration, expanded the temple in 2002, by
adding the â€œBeltry, the Drum Tower, the Wing Room, the Hall of Mahavira and Hall of Nine
Persons, Eighteen Arhats, the Villa of Jiang Jieshi and Song Meilingâ€�. New additions
included board walks, compound wall and a new gate from the southern end of the temple.

Tomb of Bai Juyi

Bai Garden is temple situated on the Pipa peak, to the north of the east hill (Xiangshan Hill).
It was re-built in 1709 by Tang Youzeng of the Qing Dynasty. The temple is surrounded by thick
vegetation of pine and cypress trees.

Tomb of Bai Juyi



The Tomb ofÂ  Bai Juyi Â on the east bank is of the well known poet during the Tang Dynasty
rule who lived inÂ  Luoyang Â during his later years. The tomb is located on the hill top.
It is approached from west bank after crossing a bridge across the Yi River. The tomb is a
circular mound of earth of 4 meters height with a circumference of 52 meters. The tomb is 2.80
meters high and has the poets name inscribed on it as Bai Juyi.

Delamination of the limestone from which the figures are carved

As one of the major activities achieved in this direction is the recognition given to the
monuments by UNESCO in declaring the Longmenâ€™s Grottoes as a heritage monument,
after due evaluation over a period, and inscribing it in the World Heritage List based on
â€œCriteria (i), (ii), and (iii); Criterion (i), the sculptures of the Longmen Grottoes
are an outstanding manifestation of human artistic creativity; Criterion (ii) the Longmen
Grottoes illustrate the perfection of a long-established art form which was to play a highly
significant role in the cultural evolution of this region of Asia; and Criterion (iii), the
high cultural level and sophisticated society of Tang Dynasty China is encapsulated in the
exceptional stone carvings of the Longmen Grottoes.â€� This also enjoins on the
Government of China to take adequate steps to preserve the monuments to its heritage status as
per guidelines issued from time to time after frequent inspections of the site.

The Longmen Grottoes have undergone many concerted efforts of identifying, demarcating,
planning and implementing restoration works since 1951. To start with, a weather monitoring
station was established near the grottoes to assess the environmental conditions
prevailing in the area to plan appropriate restoration measures. This was followed by
intensive restoration works, initially in the form of strengthening of the rock bases to
arrest seepage of water from the roofs and sides of the grottoes. Overgrown vegetation with
roots was cleared. Approach conditions to access the caves were newly installed in the form of
railings, footpaths and walkways with steps. All the efforts taken by theÂ  government of
China Â over the last nearly six decades has ensured that the grottoes are preserved in a
fairly presentable state of conservation. All this has been achieved by integrated action by
three institutions namely; the China Institution of Cultural Relics Protection who
provided the professional scientific inputs, theÂ  China University of Geosciences
Â and the Longmen Cultural Relics Care Agency. Funds for the studies and restoration works
have been provided for under the Revised Five-Year and Ten-Year Plans approved by the
Peopleâ€™s Government of Luoyang City, in 1999.

What Does the Top of the Moon Look Like?

northern summer.

Hereâ€™s a view of the moon youâ€™ll never see from Earth.

NASA scientists created this mosaic by stitching together 983 images of the moonâ€™s
North Pole region taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The LRO robotic probe,
which has been mapping the moon Â from above since 2009, has acquired thousands of
wide-angle camera shots of its polar regions.

Because the mottled moon only tilts on its axis at an angle of 1.54 degrees (as compared to
Earthâ€™s 23.5 degree tilt) some of its surface never sees sunlight. One goal of the LRO
mission is to identify these regions of permanent shadow. TheÂ  probe took the photos
Â in the composite image above at the height of summer in our satelliteâ€™s northern
hemisphere â€” the time when the pole is best illuminated. Thus, dark areas, such as
those along the inside rims of deep craters and the immediate vicinity of the pole, are
probably permanently dark.

The craters around the pole appear to spiral out from it. According to Mark Robinson,
principal investigator of the LRO team based at Arizona State University, this is an optical
illusion.

â€œImagine a series of very narrow pie slices collected 12 times each day, one after
another,â€� Robinson told Lifeâ€™s Little Mysteries. â€œIt takes roughly
360 slices to fill in the whole pie. Each day the sun direction is progressing around the moon,
thus the direction that the sun is striking the surface changes. So the shadow directions
slowly progress around the moon, thus leading to the illusion.â€�

Why Do Photos From Deep Space Take So Long to Get to Earth?

Why Do Photos From Deep Space Take So Long to Get to Earth?

Remy Melina, Lifeâ€™s Little Mysteries Staff Writer

http://www.lifeslittlemysteries.com/images/i/506/i02/comet-02.jpg?1324321683
NASAâ€™s Stardust-NExT mission took this image of comet Tempel 1 on Feb 14, 2011.

The Stardust-NExT probe took photos of the comet Tempel 1 at approximately 11:35 p.m. EST
yesterday (Feb. 14), but the images werenâ€™t beamed back to Earth until about four
hours later. Photos from deep space often take a while to come in, for various reasons, but the
Stardust images took longer than most.

â€œA number of things contributed to us receiving the images later than we expected,
including the order in which we received the images, weather conditions, the
spacecraftâ€™s range and the processing of the images,â€� Randii Wessen, a
spokesperson and engineer for JPL, told Lifeâ€™s Little Mysteries.

The plan was to first transmit theÂ  images that Stardust took Â when it was closest to
Tempel 1, at a distance of 112 miles (181 kilometers) away. Although Stardust continuously
took photos as it approached theÂ  comet , passed alongside it and looked backward at it,
mission controllers at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif.,
wanted to get the closest shots of Tempel 1 transmitted first.

The best images were taken during the middle of the flyby, and we wanted five images from the
middle to be sent to us first,â€� Wessen said. â€œBut instead, the images were
transmitted to us sequentially, with 72 images total.â€�

Stardust is operating 209 million miles from Earth, and Wessen estimates that it took 18 to 19
minutes for the images to arrive. (By comparison, a similar radio transmission fromÂ  the
moon Â would take about a second-and-a-half to reach Earth.) Because the images were
transmitted one by one, it took significantly longer for the â€œgood stuffâ€� to
get to Earth.

Wessen said that he didnâ€™t know why the middle images werenâ€™t sent first as
planned, but that no data had been lost â€“ it just took longer for the JPL team to get the
best approach images because they had to wait for Stardust to transmit them.

Additionally, rain clouds over Madrid slowed the data download to one of the three dish
antenna sites that comprise the Deep Space Network (DSN), which is responsible for receiving
raw data from Stardust-NExT and otherÂ  spacecrafts Â .

Once the images arrive, it takes a little while to make them presentable to the public. The raw
radio frequency data that is sent from Stardust to the JPL has to be processed into binary
digits, which are codes made using only the numbers 0 and 1. This information is then
translated into a high-resolution image, or frame, that JPL engineers manipulate to make the
photo clearer and brighter. Wessen likens this process to turning up the contrast option on a
TV screen in order to improve the quality of the picture.

New â€˜Doomsday Preppersâ€™ Show Highlights Extreme Survivalists

New â€˜Doomsday Preppersâ€™ Show Highlights Extreme Survivalists

by Natalie Wolchover, Lifeâ€™s Little Mysteries Staff Writer Date: 06 February 2012
Time: 03:13 PM ET

Image:
http://www.lifeslittlemysteries.com/images/i/1479/i02/doomsday-preppers2.png?1328560229
Floresville, Texas: Paul Range and Gloria Haswell have constructed a house entirely out of
used shipping containers.

Itâ€™s better to be safe than sorry, which is why FEMA guidelines recommend stockpiling
your pantry with three days worth of food in case of a natural disaster. Meanwhile, Paul Range
and Gloria Haswell have enough in store to feed 22 people for 15 years â€” as well as enough
guns, bullets and bug-out vehicles to wage a small war. The couple occupies nine steel
shipping containers arranged in a castle formation outside Floresville, Texas. A system of
windmills and solar panels powers the compound, and human body waste is used to generate
methane, which serves as their cooking fuel.

Itâ€™s all because they are worried Earthâ€™s magnetic poles might switch.

Range and Haswell are among those profiled in â€œDoomsday Preppers,â€� a weekly TV
documentary premiering on the National Geographic Channel tomorrow (Feb. 7) at 9 p.m., with a
bonus episode at 10 p.m. following the premiere. The show takes viewers on a shocking tour of
modern-day apocalypse paranoia, from Range, Haswell and their steel fortress to a
Californian who has trained himself to survive off garden weeds in preparation for aÂ 
major earthquake .

While the show may highlight a few of Americaâ€™s most extreme cases, apocalypticism
â€” fear of the end of the world as we know it â€” is at a historic high point,
according to Lorenzo DiTommasso, chairman and associate professor of religion at Concordia
University in Montreal. The phenomenon has experienced peaks and valleys throughout
history. Right now, â€œweâ€™re in a peak, and have been for the last 40
years,â€� DiTommasso said.

Fear of nuclear obliteration started the rise in apocalypticism, but today, the main factor
driving its continuing spread is the rapid exchange of ideas â€” especiallyÂ 
scaryÂ  ideas Â â€” on the Web.

â€œThereâ€™s no single more important explanation as to the presence of
apocalyptic thought in the world today than the development of the Internet,â€�
DiTommasso told Lifeâ€™s Little Mysteries. â€œYou can learn everything you want
about the flipping of the magnetic poles on the Internet. And you can find out related
information that would lead you to also believe the poles are going to flip because of, for
instance, the presence of a previously unknown planet in the solar system.â€� [
Believers In Mysterious Planet Nibiru Await Earth's End ]

Indeed, doomsday preppers Range and Haswell have come to believe that the coming magnetic
pole reversal will cause a sudden shift in the continents, triggering enormous earthquakes
and rapid climate change. Theyâ€™ve learned just enough to inspire a total lifestyle
transformation â€” despite the scientific consensus that the chance of a magnetic pole
reversal happening in their lifetimes is vanishingly small.

Others profiled in the show fear a total financial collapse, anÂ  electro-magnetic pulse
caused by a solar flare Â taking down the national power grid,Â  terrorist attacks
Â and so on. â€œPeople come to apocalypticism for different reasons, and once
theyâ€™re there they share a set of assumptions that defines the group: First, they
believe there is something dreadfully wrong with the world, and itâ€™s not likely to be
fixed. The second part is they believe an imminent change is coming about,â€�
DiTommasso said.

He estimates that more than half of the world population believes in some sort of apocalyptic
theory, from the Christian, Jewish and Muslim belief in the return of God (calledÂ  the
Rapture Â in Christianity), to the belief in pseudo-scientific theories like a coming
planetary collision. The current peak in doomsday fears, DiTommasso said, â€œspeaks to
the prevalence of doomsday preppers today.â€�

Personally, DiTommasso believes apocalypticists are correct in recognizing that there are
grave threats in the world, but theyâ€™re misguided as to what forms these will take.
â€œYou donâ€™t have toÂ  expect an apocalypse,â€� he said. â€œLook
outside â€” the environment is being degraded right now. Instead of standing outside,
looking up for the comet thatâ€™s going to obliterate the Earth, look around
you.â€�

ERWIN ROMMEL

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia and others

Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel Â (

Â  listen Â  ( help Â· info ) ) (15 November 1891 â€“ 14 October 1944), popularly
known as theÂ  Desert Fox Â ( WÃŒstenfuchs ,Â 

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png
Â  listen ( help Â· info ) ), was aÂ  German Â  Field Marshal Â ofÂ  World War II . He
won the respect of both his own troops and the enemies he fought.

He was a highly decorated officer inÂ  World War I , and was awarded theÂ  Pour le MÃ©rite
Â for his exploits on theÂ  Italian front . In World War II, he further distinguished
himself as the commander of theÂ  7th Panzer Division Â during theÂ  1940 invasion of
France . However, it was his leadership of German and Italian forces in theÂ  North African
campaign Â that established the legend of the Desert Fox. He is considered to have been one
of the most skilled commanders ofÂ  desert warfare Â in the conflict.Â He later
commanded the German forces opposing theÂ  Allied cross-channelÂ  invasion in
Normandy .

As one of the few generals who consistently fought the Western Allies (he was never assigned to
theÂ  Eastern Front ), Rommel is regarded as having been a humane and professional officer.
HisÂ  Afrikakorps Â was never accused of war crimes. Soldiers captured during his
Africa campaign were reported to have been treated humanely. Furthermore, he ignored orders
to kill capturedÂ  commandos ,Â  Jewish Â soldiers and civilians in all theaters of
his command.

Late in the war, Rommel was linked to theÂ  conspiracy Â to killÂ  Adolf Hitler .
Because Rommel was widely renowned, Hitler chose to eliminate him quietly; in trade for
assurances his family would be spared, Rommel agreed to commit suicide. Erwin Johannes Eugen

Early life and career



Rommel was born on 15 November 1891 inÂ  Heidenheim , 45 kilometres (28Â mi) fromÂ  Ulm
, in the Kingdom ofÂ  WÃŒrttemberg Â (then part of the German Empire). He was baptised
on 17 November 1891. He was the second child of theÂ  Protestant Â headmaster of the
secondary school at Aalen , Professor Erwin Rommel Senior (1860â€“1913), and Helene
von Luz, who had two other sons and a daughter. Rommel wrote that â€œmy early years passed
quite happily.â€�

At age 14, Rommel and a friend built a full-scale glider that was able to fly short distances.
Rommel even considered becoming anÂ  engineer and throughout his life displayed
extraordinary technical aptitude. Acceding to his fatherâ€™s wishes, Rommel instead
joined the local 124th WÃŒrttemberg Infantry Regiment as an officer cadet in 1910 and was
sent to the Officer Cadet School inÂ  Danzig . He graduated on 15 November 1911 and was
commissioned as aÂ  lieutenant Â in January 1912.

While at Cadet School, Rommel met his future wife, 17-year-old Lucia Maria Mollin (commonly
calledÂ  Lucie ). They married on 27 November 1916 in Danzig and on 24 December 1928 had a
son,Â  Manfred Rommel , who later became the Mayor ofÂ  Stuttgart . Some historians
believe Rommel also had a relationship withÂ  Walburga Stemmer Â in 1913, which
allegedly produced a daughter, Gertrud.

DuringÂ  World War I , Rommel fought inÂ  France Â as well as inÂ  Romania Â (
see:Â  Romanian Campaign ) andÂ  Italy Â ( see:Â  Italian Campaign ), first in the
6th WÃŒrttemberg Infantry Regiment, but through most of the war in the WÃŒrttemberg
Mountain Battalion of the eliteÂ  Alpenkorps .

the Isonzo river front.

The award was for theÂ  Battle of Longarone Â and the capture of Mount Matajur Â and its
Italian defenders, which totalled 150 officers, 9,000 men, and 81 artillery pieces. In
contrast, Rommelâ€™s detachment suffered only 6 dead and 30 wounded during the two
engagements, a remarkable achievement.



Image: http://www.achtungpanzer.com/images/matilda.jpg

For a time, Rommel served in the same infantry regiment asÂ  Friedrich Paulus , who like
Rommel rose to the rank of Field Marshal during World War II. While fighting atÂ  Isonzo ,
Rommel was caught behind Italian lines but managed to escape capture, though almost all of his
staff were taken prisoner. In the Second World War, when the Germans and Italians were allies,
Rommel tempered his initial disdain of Italian soldiers, when he realized that their lack of
success was principally due to poor leadership and equipment. When these difficulties were
overcome they were equal to German forces.Erwin Rommel wrote a book,Â  Infanterie Greift
An Â (Infantry Attacks), in which he examined and analyzed the many battles he fought in
during World War I. It was published in 1937 and became essential reading for both German and
allied commanders during World War II. He taught his men to dig in whenever they paused for any
length of time. This paid off many times when French artillery fired upon his position, only to
be shrugged off by the entrenchments built by Rommelâ€™s men.

Career between the world wars



Rommel held battalion commands and was an instructor at theÂ  Dresden Â Infantry School
from 1929 to 1933. In 1934, his book for infantry training, â€œ Gefechts-Aufgaben fÃŒr
Zug und KompanieÂ : Ein Handbuch fÃŒr den Offizierunterricht â€œ (Combat tasks for
platoon and company: A manual for the officer instruction), appeared. This book was printed
until 1945 in five editions, with revisions and changes of title. From 1935 to 1938, Rommel
held commands at the Potsdam War Academy. Rommelâ€™s war diaries,Â  Infanterie
greift an Â ( Infantry Attacks ), published in 1937, became a highly regarded military
textbook and attracted the attention ofÂ  Adolf Hitler , who placed Rommel in charge of the
War Ministry liaison with theÂ  Hitler Youth Â ( Hitler Jugend ), Headquarters of
Military Sports, the branch involved with paramilitary activities, primarily terrain
exercises and marksmanship. Rommel applied himself energetically to the task. The army
provided instructors to the Hitler Youth Rifle School inÂ  Thuringia , which in turn
supplied qualified instructors to the HJâ€™s regional branches.Rommel turned down a
post in theÂ  Truppenamt Â (the camouflagedÂ  General Staff ), whose existence was
forbidden by theÂ  Treaty of Versailles â€”the normal path for advancing to high rank
in the German army. Instead, he preferred to remain a frontline officer.

In 1937, Rommel conducted a tour of Hitler Youth meetings and encampments and delivered
lectures on German soldiering while inspecting facilities and exercises. Simultaneously,
he was pressuringÂ  Baldur von Schirach , theÂ  Hitler Youth Â leader, to accept an
agreement expanding the armyâ€™s involvement in Hitler Youth training. Schirach
interpreted this as a bid to turn the Hitler Youth into an army auxiliary, a â€œjunior
armyâ€� in his words. He refused and denied Rommel (whom he had come to dislike
personally, apparently out of envy for his â€œreal soldierâ€™sâ€� appeal)
access to the Hitler Youth. An agreement was concluded, but on a far more limited scope than
Rommel sought; cooperation was restricted to the armyâ€™s providing personnel to the
rifle school. By 1939 the Hitler Youth had 20,000 rifle instructors. Simultaneously, Rommel
retained his place at Potsdam. Rommel was awarded the highest war ribbons for excellent
performance.



Image: http://www.achtungpanzer.com/images/pz3af.jpg

In 1938 Rommel, now a colonel, was appointed Kommandant (commander) of the War Academy atÂ 
Wiener Neustadt Â ( Theresian Military Academy ). Rommel was removed after a short time,
however, to take command ofÂ  Adolf Hitler â€˜s personal protection battalion (
FÃŒhrerBegleitbataillon ), assigned to protect him in the special railway train (
FÃŒhrersonderzug ) used during his visits to occupied Czechoslovakia Â andÂ  Memel .
It was during this period that he met and befriendedÂ  Joseph Goebbels , the Reichâ€™s
minister ofÂ  propaganda . Goebbels became a fervent admirer of Rommel and later ensured
that Rommelâ€™s exploits were celebrated in the media.

In contrast with its traditional role in armed conflicts of the past (even in the
Polish-Bolshevik War), the cavalry was no longer seen as a unit capable of breaking through
enemy lines. Instead, it was used as a mobile reserve of the Polish armies and was using mostly
infantry tactics: the soldiers dismounted before the battle and fought as a standard (yet
fast) infantry. Technically speaking, in 1939 Poland had 11 brigades of mounted infantry and
no units of cavalry as such.



Image: http://www.wpk.p.lodz.pl/~bolas/main/uzbrojenie/armpol/kawaleria.jpg

Although the cavalrymen retained their sabres, after 1937 the lance was dropped and it was
issued to cavalrymen as a weapon of choice only. Instead, the cavalry units were equipped with
modern armament, including 75mm guns, tankettes, 37mm AT guns, 40mm AA guns, anti-tank
rifles and other pieces of modern weaponry.

Rommel acted as commander of theÂ  FÃŒhrerbegleithauptquartier Â (FÃŒhrer

theÂ  FÃŒhrersonderzug Â and seeing much of Hitler. After the Polish defeat, Rommel
returned to Berlin to organize the FÃŒhrerâ€™s victory parade, taking part himself
as a member of Hitlerâ€™s entourage. During the Polish campaign, Rommel was asked to
intervene on behalf of one of his wifeâ€™s relatives, a Polish priest who had been
arrested. When Rommel applied to theÂ  Gestapo Â for information, the Gestapo found no
information about the manâ€™s existence.

Portrait of Generalfeldmarschall Â Rommel

Rommel asked Hitler for command of a panzer division. On 6 February 1940, three months before
the invasion of France, Rommel was given command of theÂ  7th Panzer Division , forÂ  Fall
Gelb Â (â€œCase Yellowâ€�), the invasion ofÂ  France Â and theÂ  Low
Countries . This promotion provoked resentment among some of his fellow officers.
Rommelâ€™s initial request for command had been rejected by the Chief of Army
Personnel, who cited his lack of previous experience with armored units and his extensive
prior experience in an Alpine unit made him a more suitable candidate to assume command of a
mountain division that had recent need to fill its commanding officer post.Â Rommel had,
however, emphasized the use of mobile infantry and recognized the great usefulness of
armoured forces in the Poland campaign. He set about learning and developing the techniques
of armoured warfare with great enthusiasm.Â The decision to place him in command of an
armoured division was borne out to be an excellent one. In May, 1940 his 7th Panzer Division
became known as the â€œGhost Divisionâ€� because its rapid advances and fast paced
attacks often placed them so far forward that they were frequently out of communication with
the rest of the German army.

German troops in Paris

On 10 May 1940 a part ofÂ  XV Corps Â underÂ  General Hoth Â advanced intoÂ 
Belgium Â to proceed to theÂ  Meuse river Â near theÂ  Walloon Â municipality
ofÂ  Dinant . At the Meuse, 7th Panzer was held up owing to the bridges having been destroyed
and to determined sniper and artillery fire from the Belgian defenders. The Germans lacked
smoke grenades, so Rommel, having assumed personal command of the crossing, ordered a few
nearby houses to be set on fire to conceal the attack. The German Panzergrenadiers crossed the
river in rubber boats, with Rommel leading the second wave.Â The Division dashed further
inland, always spurred on by Rommel and far in front of any friendly forces.

Rommelâ€™s technique of pushing forward boldly, ignoring risks to his flanks and rear
and relying on the shock to enemy morale to hinder attacks on his vulnerable flanks, paid large
dividends during his rapid march across France.Â When encountering resistance, Rommel
would simply order his tanks forward, all guns blazing, relying on the shock of the sudden
assault to force the enemy to surrender. This method offset the disadvantage the German tanks
had in terms of armour and low-calibre guns, often causing large formations of enemy heavy
tanks to simply give up a fight they would otherwise have had a good chance of winning.Â This
approach, although it saved lives on both sides by avoiding prolonged engagements, did cause
mishaps. On one occasion his tanks, following this tactic, closed with a convoy of French
trucks and fired into them only to realise that the trucks were acting as ambulances ferrying
wounded from the front.

By 18 May the Division had capturedÂ  Cambrai , but here Rommelâ€™s advance was
checked briefly. His chief of staff, still with the unmotorized part of the Division in
Belgium and not having received radio reports from Rommel, had written off Rommel and his
combat group as lost and so had not arranged for fuel to be sent up.Â There was a degree of
controversy over this issue, with Rommel furious at what he perceived as a negligent attitude
on the part of his supply officers, whereas his chief of staff was critical of Rommelâ€™s
failure to keep his staff officers informed of his actions.

On 20 May Rommelâ€™s tanks reachedÂ  Arras . Here he wanted to cut off theÂ  British
Expeditionary Force Â from the coast andÂ  Hans von Luck , commanding the
reconnaissance battalion of the Division, was tasked with forcing a crossing over theÂ  La
BassÃ©e canals Â near the city. Supported byÂ  Stuka Â dive bombers, the unit
managed to cross whereupon the British launched a counterattack (theÂ  Battle of Arras ) on
21 May. Facing the BritishÂ  Matilda tanks , the Germans found their 3.7-cm guns useless
against the heavy armour and a battery ofÂ  88 mm guns Â had to be brought up to deal with the

Operation Dynamo , evacuated their troops at Dunkirk, and the 7th Panzer Division was given a
few days of much-needed rest. On 26 May, 7th Panzer continued its advance, reachingÂ  Lille
Â on 27 May. For the assault on the town, General Hoth placed his other tank division,Â 
5th Panzer Division , under Rommelâ€™s command, to the chagrin of its commander,
GeneralÂ  Max von Hartlieb .Â The same day, Rommel received news that he had been awarded
theÂ  Knightâ€™s Cross of the Iron Cross ; the first divisional commander to be so
honoured during the campaign. Knightâ€™s Cross of the Iron Cross

This award, which had been secured for Rommel at Hitlerâ€™s behest, caused more
animosity among fellow officers, who were critical of Rommelâ€™s close relationship
with Hitler. They believed that this was further evidence that Hitler seemed to give Rommel
preferential treatment.

On 28 May, while making the final push into Lille and far in front of friendly forces, 7th Panzer
came under heavy fire from French artillery. Rommel drove his forces on, capturing Lille,
trapping half of the French First Army, and preventing their retreat to Dunkirk. After this
coup, Rommelâ€™s forces were again given time to rest.

Rommel, resuming his advance on 5 June, drove for theÂ  River Seine Â to secure the
bridges nearÂ  Rouen . Advancing 100 kilometres (62Â mi) in two days, the division
reached Rouen only to find the bridges destroyed. On 10 June, Rommel reached the coast
nearÂ  Dieppe , sending his â€œAm at coastâ€� signal to the German HQ.

35 kilometres (22Â mi), capturing the town on the following day. The Division then
proceeded towardsÂ  Bordeaux Â but stopped when the armistice was signed on 21 June. In
July, the Division was sent to theÂ  Paris Â area to start preparations forÂ 
Operation SeelÃ¶we , Sea Lion the planned invasion of Britain. The preparations were
half-hearted, however, as it soon became clear that the Luftwaffe would not be able to secure
air superiority over the Royal Air Force.

7. Panzer-Division Â was later nicknamedÂ  Gespenster-Division Â (theÂ 
â€œGhost Divisionâ€� ), because of the speed and surprise it was consistently able
to achieve, to the point that even theÂ  German High Command Â at times lost track of its
whereabouts. It also set the record for the longest thrust in one day by tanks up to that point,
covering nearly 320 kilometres (200Â mi).

Rommel received both praise and criticism for his tactics during the French campaign. Many,
such as GeneralÂ  Georg Stumme , who had previously commanded 7th Panzer Division, were
impressed with the speed and success of Rommelâ€™s drive; however, others were more
reserved, some out of envy, others because they felt Rommel took unnecessary risks.Â 
Hermann Hoth Â publicly expressed praise for Rommelâ€™s achievements but had
private reservations, saying in a confidential report that Rommel should not be given
command over a corps unless he gained â€œgreater experience and a better sense of
judgment.Â Hoth also accused Rommel of an unwillingness to acknowledge the
contributions of others to his victories.

The Fourth Army commander, GeneralÂ  GÃŒnther von Kluge , also criticised Rommel for
falsely claiming all the glory for his achievements. Rommel did not, Kluge felt, acknowledge
the contribution of theÂ  Luftwaffe , and Rommelâ€™s manuscript describing his
campaign in France misrepresented the advances of neighbouring units to elevate the
achievements of his own dazzling advances. Kluge also cited the complaint by General
Hartlieb that Rommel had misappropriated 5th Panzerâ€™s bridging tackle on 14 May
after his own supplies had run out in order to cross the Meuse, delaying 5th Panzer for several
hours.Â Rommel had repeated this procedure on 27 May at the River Scarpe crossing.

Rommelâ€™s reward for his success was to be promoted and appointed commander of theÂ

HisÂ  campaign Â in North Africa earned Rommel the nickname â€œThe Desert
Fox.â€� On 6 February 1941 Rommel was ordered to lead theÂ  Afrika Korps , sent toÂ 
Italian Libya Â to help shore up the Italian forces which had been driven back during
Operation Compass , launched byÂ  British Commonwealth forces underÂ  Major-General
Â  Richard Oâ€™Connor Â during December 1940. Initially ordered to assume a
defensive posture and hold the front line, the Axis High Command had slated a limited
offensive towardsÂ  Agedabia Â andÂ  Benghazi for May, planning then to hold the line
between those cities. Rommel argued that such a limited offensive would be ineffective, as
the whole ofÂ  Cyrenaica Â would have to be captured if the front lines were to be
held.Â The task of even holding the remaining Italian possessions seemed daunting, as the
Italians had only 7,000 troops remaining in the area after Oâ€™Connorâ€™s
successful capture of 130,000 prisoners and almost 400 tanks during the previous three
months of advance.

On 24 March 1941 Rommel launched a limited offensive with only theÂ  5th Light Division
Â supported by two Italian divisions. This thrust was to be minor, in anticipation of
Rommel receiving theÂ  15th Panzer Division Â in May. The British, who had been weakened
by troops being withdrawn to fight in theÂ  Battle of Greece , fell back to Mersa el Brega and
started constructing defensive works. Rommel decided to continue the attack against these
positions in order to prevent the British from building up the fortifications.Â After a
day of fierce fighting, the Germans prevailed and the advance continued as Rommel
disregarded holding off the attack on Agedabia until May. The British
Commander-in-ChiefÂ  Middle East Command , GeneralÂ  Archibald Wavell ,
overestimating the strength of the Axis forces and already apprehensive about the extent of
his advances during the previous winter, ordered a withdrawal from Benghazi in early April to
avoid being cut off by Rommelâ€™s thrust.

Rommel, seeing the British reluctance to fight a decisive action, decided on a bold move: the
seizure of the whole of Cyrenaica despite having only light forces. He ordered the
ItalianÂ  Ariete Â armoured division to pursue the retreating British while the 5th
Light Division was to move on Benghazi.Â  Generalmajor Â  Johannes Streich , the 5th
Light Divisionâ€™s commander, protested this order on the grounds of the state of his
vehicles, but Rommel brushed the objections aside because, in his words, â€œOne cannot
permit unique opportunities to slip by for the sake of trifles.â€�Â The Italian
Commander-in-Chief, GeneralÂ  Italo Gariboldi , tried repeatedly to halt
Rommelâ€™s advance but was unable to contact him.

After Benghazi had been secured following the British withdrawal, Cyrenaica as far asÂ 
Gazala Â was captured by 8 April. This was despite fervent protests from Italian GHQ, which
felt Rommel was going beyond his orders, especially since he was supposedly under Italian
command. Rommel had received orders from the German High Command that he was not to advance
past Maradah, but he turned a blind eye to this as well as to protests from some of his staff and
divisional commanders. He believed he was grasping a great possibility to largely destroy
the Allied presence in North Africa and captureÂ  Egypt . Rommel decided to keep up the
pressure on the retreating British and launched an outflanking offensive on the important
port ofÂ  Tobruk Â during which he managed to capture on 9 April the Military Governor of
Cyrenaica, Lieutenant-GeneralÂ  Philip Neame Â as well as Oâ€™Connor, who at
this time was his advisor. With Italian forces attacking along the coast, Rommel decided to
sweep around to the south and attack the harbour from the southeast with the 5th Light
Division, hoping to trap the bulk of the enemy force there. This outflanking could not be
carried out as rapidly as was necessary owing to logistical problems from lengthening supply
lines and spoiling flank attacks from Tobruk, so Rommelâ€™s plan failed. By 11 April the
envelopment of Tobruk was complete and the first attack was launched. Other forces continued
pushing east, reachingÂ  Bardia Â and securing the whole of Libya by 15 April.

Siege of Tobruk

The followingÂ  siege of Tobruk Â lasted 240 days, with the garrison consisting of
theÂ  Australian 9th Division Â underÂ  Lieutenant General Â  Leslie Morshead
Â and reinforced by all the British troops who had withdrawn to the port city, bringing the
defenders to a total of 25,000. Impatient to secure success, Rommel launched repeated
small-scale attacks. These were easily defeated by the defenders. Rommel later criticised
the Italian High Command for failing to provide him with the blueprints of the portâ€™s
fortifications (which the Italians had built before the war), but this was due to his
surprising advance so far beyond the agreed point, hardly allowing them time to produce the
plans. Reflecting on this period, GeneralÂ  Heinrich Kirchheim , then commander of the 5th
Light Division, said: â€œI do not like to be reminded of that time because so much blood was
needlessly shed.â€�Â Kirchheim had been reluctant to launch further attacks on
Tobruk, as the costs of earlier assaults had been very high.

Rommel remained optimistic that success was imminent. In his memoirs, he claimed that he
immediately realised that the enemy was determined to cling to Tobruk; however, this seems to
be in doubt. In a letter to his wife dated 16 April,Â he wrote that the enemy was already
abandoning the town by sea, and he remained confident that the enemy were not going to defend
the town until well into April.Â In reality, the ships arriving at the port were not
evacuating the defenders but unloading supplies and even some reinforcements. A letter of
his written on 21 April,suggests that he was beginning to realise this while the arrival of the
Italian blueprints of fortifications provided further grounds for discouragement.
Nonetheless, Rommel continued to insist that success was imminent. His relations with his
subordinate commanders were at their nadir at this point, especially with Streich, who was
openly critical of Rommelâ€™s decisions and refused to assume any responsibility for
the attacks. Rommel began holding a series ofÂ  courts-martial , though ultimately he
signed almost none of the verdicts. This state of affairs led Army ChiefÂ  Walther von
Brauchitsch Â to write to him that instead of making threats and requesting the
replacement of officers who â€œhitherto had excelled in battleâ€�, rather
â€œâ€Š a calm and constructive debate might bring better results.â€� Rommel
remained unmoved.

At this point Rommel requested reinforcements for a renewed attack, but theÂ  High Command
, then completing preparations forÂ  Operation Barbarossa , could not spare any. When
Chief of Staff GeneralÂ  Franz Halder Â also told Rommel before the latter left for
Africa that a larger force could not be logistically sustained, Rommel had responded
â€œthatâ€™s your pigeon.â€� Now Halder sarcastically commented:
â€œNow at last he is constrained to state that his forces are not sufficiently strong to
allow him to take full advantage of the â€˜unique opportunitiesâ€™ offered by the
overall situation. That is the impression we have had for quite some time over here.Â Angry
that his order not to advance beyond Maradah had been disobeyed and alarmed at mounting
losses, Halder, never an admirer of Rommel, dispatchedÂ  Friedrich Paulus Â to (in
Halderâ€™s words) â€œhead off this soldier gone stark mad.

Upon arrival on 27 April, Paulus was initially persuaded to authorise yet another attack on
Tobruk. Back in Berlin, Halder wrote: â€œIn my view it is a mistakeâ€� but deferred
to Paulus. When the attack, launched on 4 May, seemed to turn into a disaster, Paulus
intervened and ordered it halted. In addition, he now forbade Rommel from committing forces
in any new attack on Tobruk and further ordered that the attacks were to halt until regrouping
was completed. No new assault was to take place without OKHâ€™s specific approval.

Rommel was furious with what he perceived as the lack of fighting spirit in his commanders and
Italian allies. However, on the insistence of Paulus and Halder, he held off further attacks
until the detailed plans of the Tobruk defences could be obtained, the 15th Panzer Division
could be brought up to support the attack, and more training of his troops in positional
warfare could be conducted,For Streich, however, it was too late. He was transferred from
command of 5th Light Division. When he met Rommel for the last time as he was taking his leave,
Rommel told him that he had been â€œtoo concerned for the well-being of your
troopsâ€�; Streich shot back: â€œI can recognise no greater words of
praiseâ€�, and a new quarrel ensued.Â After the decision was made to hold off attacks
on Tobruk for an indefinite period, Rommel set about creating defensive positions, with
Italian infantry forces holding Bardia, the Sollumâ€“Sidi Omar line and investing
Tobruk. The mobile German and Italian formations were held in reserve to fight any British
attacks from Egypt. To this end,Â  Halfaya Pass Â was secured, the high water mark of
Rommelâ€™s offensive. An elaborately prepared great assault was scheduled for 21
November 1941, but this attack never took place.

Whereas the defenders of Tobruk could be supplied by sea, the logistical problems of theÂ 
Afrika Korps Â greatly hampered its operations, and a concentrated counterattack
southwards by the besieged Allies might have succeeded in reaching El Adam and severing the
lines of communication and supply of the Axis forces at Bardia, Sollum and Halfya covering the
Egyptian border. General Morshead, however, was misled by intelligence overestimates of
the German forces investing Tobruk, and so no major action was attempted.

General Wavell made two unsuccessful attempts to relieve Tobruk ( OperationÂ  Brevity
Â (launched on 15 May 1941) andÂ  OperationÂ  Battleaxe (launched on 15 June 1941).
Both operations were easily defeated, as they were hastily prepared, partly owing toÂ 
Churchill â€˜s impatience for speedy action. DuringÂ  Brevity Â the important
Halfaya Pass was briefly recaptured by the British but was lost again on 27 May.Â  Battleaxe
resulted in the loss of 87 British for 25 German tanks in a four-day battle raging on the flanks
of the Sollum and Halfaya Passes, with the British being unable to take these well-fortified
positions.

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

In August, Rommel was appointed commander of the newly created Panzer Group Africa. His
previous command, theÂ  Afrika Korps , comprising the 15th Panzer Division and the 5th
Light Division, which by then had been redesignated 21st Panzer Division, was put under
command ofÂ  Generalleutnant Â  Ludwig CrÃŒwell , withÂ  Fritz Bayerlein Â as
chief of staff. In addition to theÂ  Afrika Korps , Rommelâ€™s Panzer Group had
theÂ  90th Light Division Â and six Italian divisions, theÂ  Ariete Â andÂ 
Trieste Â Divisions forming theÂ  Italian XX Motorized Corps , three infantry
divisions investing Tobruk, and one holding Bardia.

Allied counter offensive

Rommel conversing with his staff nearÂ  El Agheila , January 12, 1942.

Following the costly failure ofÂ  Battleaxe , Wavell was replaced by the
Commander-in-Chief of India, General Claude Auchinleck . Allied forces were reorganised
and strengthened to two corps,Â  XXX andÂ  XIII , and became theÂ  British Eighth Army
Â under the command ofÂ  Alan Cunningham . Auchinleck, having 770 tanks and 1,000
aircraft to support him, launched a major offensive to relieve Tobruk ( OperationÂ 
Crusader ) on 18 November 1941. Rommel had two armoured divisions, the 15th and 21st with a
total of 260 tanks, the 90th Light Infantry division, and three Italian corps, five infantry
and one armoured division with 154 tanks, with which to oppose him.

The Eighth Army deeply outflanked the German defences along the Egyptian frontier with a left
hook through the desert, and reached a position from which they could strike at both Tobruk and
the coastal road, the â€œVia Balbiaâ€�. Auchinleck planned to engage theÂ 
Afrika Korps Â with his armoured division, while XXX Corps assaulted the Italian
positions atÂ  Bardia , encircling the troops there. But the British operational plan had
one major flaw. When XXX corps reached the area of Qabr Salih, it was assumed that theÂ 
Afrika Korps Â would attack eastward, allowing the British to surround them with a
southerly armour thrust. Rommel, however, did not find it necessary to do as the British
planned, and instead attacked the southernly armoured thrust at Sidi Rezegh.

Rommel was now faced with the decision of whether to continue the planned attack on Tobruk in
late May, trusting his screening forces to hold off the advancing British, or to reorient his
forces to hit the approaching British columns. He decided the risks were too great and called
off the attack on Tobruk.

The British armoured thrusts were largely defeated by fierce resistance from antitank
positions and tanks. The ItalianÂ  Ariete Â Armoured Division was forced to give ground
while inflicting heavy losses on the advancing British at Bir el Gobi, whereas the 21st Panzer
Division checked the attack launched against them and counterattacked on Gabr
Saleh.Â Over the next two days the British continued pressing their attack, sending their
armoured brigades into battle in a piecemeal fashion,Â while Rommel, aware of his
numerical inferiority, launched a concentrated attack on 23 November with all his armour.
The 21st Panzer Division held their defensive positions at Sidi Rezegh, while 15th Panzer
Division and the ItalianÂ  Ariete Â Division attacked the flanks and enveloped the
British armour. During this battle, among the biggest armoured battles of the North African
campaign, the British tanks were surrounded, with about two-thirds destroyed and the
survivors having to fight themselves out of the trap and head south to Gabr Saleh.

Rommelâ€™s counterattacks



On 24 November Rommel, wanting to exploit the halt of the British offensive, counterattacked
into the British rear areas in Egypt with the intention of exploiting the disorganisation and
confusion in the enemyâ€™s bases and cutting their supply lines. Rommel considered the
other, more conservative, course of action of destroying the British forces halted before
Tobruk and Bardia too time consuming.Â Rommel knew his forces were incapable of driving
such an effort home, but believed that the British, traumatised by their recent debacle,
would abandon their defences along the border at the appearance of a German threat to their
rear.

General Cunningham did, as Rommel had hoped, decide to withdraw the Eighth Army to Egypt, but
Auchinleck arrived fromÂ  Cairo Â just in time to cancel the withdrawal orders.Â The
German attack, which began with only 100 operational tanks remaining,Â stalled as it
outran its supplies and met stiffening resistance. The counterattack was criticised by the
German High Command and some of his staff officers as too dangerous with Commonwealth forces
still operating along the coast east of Tobruk, and a wasteful attack as it bled his forces, in
particular his remaining tank force. Among the Staff officers who were critical wasÂ 
Friedrich von Mellenthin , who said that â€œUnfortunately, Rommel overestimated his
success and believed the moment had come to launch a general pursuit.Â In Rommelâ€™s
favour, the attack very nearly succeeded: Cunningham ordered a withdrawal, and only
Auchinleckâ€™s timely intervention prevented this.

Tobruk relie ved, Axis retirement to El Agheila



While Rommel drove into Egypt, the remaining Commonwealth forces east of Tobruk threatened
the weak Axis lines there. Unable to reach Rommel for several days,Â Rommelâ€™s
Chief of Staff,Â  Oberstleutnant Â Westphal, ordered the 21st Panzer Division
withdrawn to support the siege of Tobruk. On 27 November the British attack on Tobruk linked up
with the defenders, and Rommel, having suffered losses that could not easily be replaced, had
to concentrate on retrieving and regrouping the divisions that had attacked into Egypt. By 6
December theÂ  Afrika Korps Â had averted the danger, and on 7 December Rommel fell back
to a defensive line at Gazala, just west of Tobruk, all the while under heavy attacks from
theÂ  RAF . The Italian forces at Bardia and on the Egyptian border were now cut off from the
retreating Axis. The Allies, briefly held up at Gazala, kept up the pressure to some degree,
although they were almost as exhausted and disorganised as Rommelâ€™s force,Â and
Rommel was forced to retreat all the way back to the starting positions he had held in March,
reachingÂ  El Agheila Â on 30 December. His main concern during his withdrawal was being
flanked to the south, so theÂ  Afrika Korps Â held the south flank during the retreat. The
Allies followed, but never attempted a southern flanking move to cut off the retreating
troops as they had done in 1940. The German-Italian garrison at Bardia surrendered on 2
January 1942.

Recapture of Gazala



On 5 January 1942 theÂ  Afrika Korps Â received 55 tanks and new supplies and Rommel
started planning a counterattack. On 21 January the attack was launched, which mauled the
Allied forces, costing them some 110 tanks and other heavy equipment. The Axis forces retook
Benghazi Â on 29 January,Â  Timimi Â on 3 February, and the Allies pulled back to the
Tobruk area and commenced building defensive positions at Gazala.

During the confusion caused by theÂ  Crusader Â operation, Rommel and his staff found
themselves behind Allied lines several times. On one occasion, he visited a New Zealand Army
field hospital that was still under Allied control. â€œ[Rommel] inquired if anything
was needed, promised the British [sic] medical supplies and drove off
unhindered.Â Eventually, Rommel did supply the medical unit with some medical
equipment.

FollowingÂ  General Kesselring â€˜s successes in creating local air superiority and
suppressing theÂ  Malta Â defenders in April 1942, an increased flow of vital supplies
reached theÂ  Panzer Armee Afrika . Previously it had been receiving about a third of its
needed supplies for several months. With his forces thus strengthened, Rommel began
planning a major push for the summer. He felt the very strong British positions around Gazala
could be outflanked, and he could then drive up behind them and destroy them.Â The British
were planning a summer offensive of their own and their dispositions were more suited for an
attack rather than a defence.

Rommel in North Africa (June 1942)

The British had 900 tanks in the area, 200 of which were newÂ  Grant Â tanks, whereas
Rommelâ€™s Panzer Army Africa Â commanded a mere 320 German, 50 of which were the
obsoleteÂ  Panzer II model, and 240 Italian tanks, which were no better than the Panzer
IIs.Â Therefore Rommel had to rely predominantly onÂ  88 mm guns Â to destroy the
British heavy tanks, but even these were in short supply. In infantry and artillery Rommel
found himself vastly outnumbered also, with many of his units under-strength following the
campaigns of 1941. In contrast to the previous year, the Axis had more-or-less air parity.

On 26 May 1942 Rommelâ€™s army attacked in a classic outflankingÂ  Blitzkrieg
Â operation in the Battle of Gazala . His Italian infantry assaulted the Gazala
fortifications head on, with some armour attached to give the impressions that this was the
main assault, while all his motorized and armoured forces outflanked the positions to the
south. On the following morning Rommel cut through the flank and attacked north, but
throughout the day a running armour battle occurred, where both sides took heavy losses. The
attempted encirclement of the Gazala position failed and the Germans lost a third of their
heavy tanks. Renewing the attack on the morning of 28 May, Rommel concentrated on encircling
and destroying separate units of the British armour. Heavy British counterattacks forced
Rommel to assume a defensive posture and not pursue his original plan of a dash north for the
coast. On 30 May he attacked eastwards to link with elements of Italian X Corps which had
cleared a path through the Allied minefields to establish a line of supply. On 2 June 90th Light
Division and theÂ  Trieste Â Division surrounded and reduced the Allied strongpoint
atÂ  Bir Hakeim , capturing it on 11 June. With his communications and the southern
strongpoint of the British line thus secured, Rommel attacked north again, forcing the
British back, relying on the minefields of the Gazala lines to protect his left flank.Â On
14 June the British began a headlong retreat eastwards, the so-called â€œGazala
Gallopâ€�, to avoid being completely cut off.

On 15 June Axis forces reached the coast eliminating any escape for the Commonwealth forces
still occupying the Gazala positions. With this task completed, Rommel set off in pursuit of
the retreating Allied formations, aiming to capture Tobruk while the enemy was confused and
disorganised.Â Tobruk, isolated and alone, was now all that stood between the Axis and
Egypt. The defenders were the 2nd South African Infantry Division and some disorganised
units recovering from the Gazala battle. On 21 June, after a swift, coordinated and fierce
combined arms Â assault, the city surrendered along with its 33,000 defenders, including
most of theÂ  South African 2nd Division . Only at the fall of Singapore , earlier that year,
had moreÂ  British Commonwealth Â troops been captured. Hitler made Rommel aÂ  Field
Marshal Â for this victory.

By this time, Rommelâ€™s gains caused considerable alarm in the Allied camp. He
appeared to be poised to deliver a crippling blow to the British by conquering Egypt. The
Allies feared Rommel would then turn northeastward to conquer the valuable oil fields of the
Middle East and then link up with the German forces besieging the equally valuable Caucasian
oil fields. However, these required substantial reinforcements that Hitler refused to
allocate. Ironically, Hitler had been sceptical about sending Rommel to Africa in the first
place. Heâ€™d only done so after constant begging by naval commanderÂ  Erich Raeder ,
and even then only to relieve the Italians. Hitler never understood global warfare, despite
Raeder and Rommelâ€™s attempts to get him to see the strategic value of Egypt.

Drive for Egypt

Rommel determined to press the attack onÂ  Mersa Matruh Â despite the heavy losses he had
suffered at Gazala and Tobruk. He also wanted to prevent the British from establishing a new
frontline, and felt the weakness of the British formations had to be exploited by a thrust into
Egypt.Â This decision met with some criticism, as an advance into Egypt meant a
significant lengthening of the supply lines.Â It also meant that a proposed attack on
Malta would have to wait, as the Luftwaffe would be required to support Rommelâ€™s drive
eastwards. Kesselring strongly disagreed with Rommelâ€™s decision, and went as far as
threatening to withdraw his aircraft toÂ  Sicily .Â Hitler agreed to Rommelâ€™s
plan, despite protest from Italian HQ and some of his staff officers, seeing the potential for
a complete victory in Africa.Â Rommel, apparently aware of his growing reputation as a
gambler, defended his decision by claiming that merely to hold the lines at Sollum would
confer upon the British a distinct advantage, in that they could more easily outflank the
positions at Sollum and the overseas supply lines would still have to be routed viaÂ 
Tripoli unless he secured a front further east.

On 22 June Rommel continued his offensive eastwards and initially little resistance was
encountered. Apart from fuel shortages, the advance continued until Mersa Matruh was
encircled on 26 June, surrounding four infantry divisions. One of the divisions managed to
break out during the night, and over the next two days some elements of the remaining three
divisions also slipped away. The fortress fell on 29 June, yielding enormous amounts of
supplies and equipment, in addition to 6,000 POWs.

On 25 June Auchinleck had assumed direct command of Eighth Army and decided to form his main
defensive line at El Alamein, where the proximity to the south of theÂ  Qattara Depression
Â created a relatively short line to defend which could not be outflanked to the south
because of the impossibility of moving armour into and through the depression. Rommel
continued his march eastwards, but with the supply situation steadily worsening and his men
exhausted after five weeks of constant warfare, the offensive onÂ  El Alamein Â seemed
in doubt. On 1 July the First Battle of El Alamein Â started, but after almost a month of
inconclusive fighting both sides, completely exhausted, dug in, halting Rommelâ€™s
drive eastwards. This was a serious blow to Rommel who had hoped to drive his advance into the
open desert beyond El Alamein where he could conduct a mobile defence.Â The Eighth Army
suffered higher casualties in the fighting around El Alamein, some 13,000, compared with
Axis losses of 7,000 men, 1,000 of which were Germans, but Rommel could afford the losses to a
much lesser degree.

More significantly, Rommel only had 13 operational tanks by the time he reached El Alamein.
Although he was only a few hundred miles from the Pyramids , he knew he didnâ€™t have the
resources to push forward. On 3 July, he wrote in his diary that his momentum had â€œfaded
away.

Allied attack: Second Battle of El Alamein



Summer standoff

After the stalemate at El Alamein, Rommel hoped to go on the offensive again before massive
amounts of men and material could reach the British Eighth Army. Allied forces fromÂ  Malta
Â were, however, intercepting his supplies at sea and the Desert Air Force kept up a
relentless campaign against Axis supply vessels in Tobruk, Bardia and Mersa Matruh. Most of
the supplies reaching the Axis troops still had to be landed at Benghazi and Tripoli, and the
enormous distances supplies had to travel to reach the forward troops meant that a rapid
resupply and reorganisation of the Axis army could not be done. Further hampering
Rommelâ€™s plans was the fact that the Italian divisions received priority on
supplies, with the Italian authorities shipping material for the Italian formations at a
much higher rate than for German formations.Â It seems the Italian HQ was uneasy with
Rommelâ€™s ambitions and wanted their own forces, whom they at least had some control
over, resupplied first.

The British, themselves preparing for a renewed drive, replaced C-in-C Auchinleck with
GeneralÂ  Harold Alexander . The Eighth Army also got a new commander,Â  Bernard
Montgomery . They received a steady stream of supplies and were able to reorganise their
forces. In late August they received a large convoy carrying over 100,000 tons of supplies,
and Rommel, learning of this, felt that time was running out. Rommel decided to launch an
attack with the 15th and 21st Panzer Division, 90th Light Division, and the Italian XX
Motorized Corps in a drive through the southern flank of the El Alamein lines. The terrain here
was without any easily defensible features and so open to attack. Montgomery and Auchinleck
before him had realised this threat, and the main defences for this sector had been set up
behind the El Alamein line along the Alam El Halfa Ridge, where any outflanking thrust could be
more easily met from overlooking defensive positions.

Battle of Alam El Halfa



TheÂ  Battle of Alam el Halfa Â was launched on 30 August, with Rommelâ€™s forces
driving through the south flank. After passing the El Alamein line to the south, Rommel drove
north at the Alam el Halfa Ridge, just as Montgomery had anticipated. Under heavy fire from
British artillery and aircraft, and in the face of well prepared positions that Rommel could
not hope to outflank due to lack of fuel, the attack stalled. By 2 September, Rommel realized
the battle was unwinnable, and decided to withdraw.

DamagedÂ  Panzer IIIs Â at Belhamed, 16 December 1941.

Montgomery had prepared to pursue the Germans but in the afternoon of 2 September, he gave
Corps commanderÂ  Brian Horrocks Â clear orders to allow the enemy to retire. This was
for two reasons: to preserve his own strength and to allow the enemy to observe, and be misled
by, the dummy preparations for an attack in the area.Nevertheless, Montgomery was keen to
inflict casualties on the enemy and orders were given for the as yet inexperiencedÂ  2nd New
Zealand Division , positioned to the north of the retreating Axis forces, andÂ  7th
Armoured Division Â to attack on 3 September. The attack was repelled, however, by a fierce
rearguard action by the 90th Light Division and Montgomery called off further action to
preserve his strength.Â On 5 September Rommel was back where he had started, with only
heavy losses to show for it. Rommel had suffered 2,940 casualties, lost 50 tanks, a similar
number of guns and, perhaps worst of all, 400 trucks, vital for supplies and movement. The
British losses, except tank losses of 68, were much less, further adding to the numerical
inferiority of Panzer Army Afrika. The Desert Air Force inflicted the highest proportions of
damage to Rommelâ€™s forces. He now realized the war in Africa was unwinnable without
more air support which was impossible since theÂ  Luftwaffe Â was already stretched to
breaking point on other fronts.

Second Battle of El Alamein

El Alamein 1942: Destroyed Panzer IIIs near Tel el Eisa

In September British raiding parties attacked important harbours and supply points. The
flow of supplies successfully ferried across the Mediterranean had fallen to a dismal level.
Some two-thirds of the supplies embarked for Africa were destroyed at sea. In addition,
Rommelâ€™s health was failing and he took sick leave in Italy and Germany from late
September. Thus he was not present when theÂ  Second Battle of El Alamein Â began on 23
October 1942. Although he returned immediately, it took him two vital days to reach his HQ in
Africa. The defensive plan at El Alamein was more static in nature than Rommel preferred, but
with shortages of motorized units and fuel, he had felt it was the only possible plan.Â The
defensive line had strong fortifications and was protected with a large minefield which in
turn was covered with machine guns and artillery. This, Rommel hoped, would allow his
infantry to hold the line at any point until motorized and armoured units in reserve could move
up and counterattack any Allied breaches.

GeneralÂ  Georg Stumme Â was in command in Rommelâ€™s absence but during the
initial fighting he died of aÂ  heart attack . This paralyzed the German HQ until
GeneralÂ  Ritter von Thoma Â took command. After returning, Rommel learned that the
fuel supply situation, critical when he left in September, was now
disastrous.Â Counterattacks by the 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions on 24 October and 25
October had incurred heavy tank losses due to the intensity of the British artillery and air
attack. Rommelâ€™s main concern was to counterattack in full force and throw the
British out of the defensive lines, which was in his view the only chance the Axis had of
avoiding defeat.Â The counterattack was launched early on 26 October but the British
units that had penetrated the defensive line inflicted heavy losses on Rommelâ€™s
armour at the position code-namedÂ  Snipe Â (often mis-namedÂ  Kidney Ridge Â due
to faulty interpretation of the ring contour â€“ it was actually a depression). The
Allies continued pushing hard with armoured units to force the breakthrough, but the
defendersâ€™ fire destroyed many tanks, leading to doubts among the officers in the
British armoured brigades about the chances of clearing a breach.

Montgomery, seeing his armoured brigades losing tanks at an alarming rate, stopped major
attacks until 2 November when he launched Operation Supercharge Â and achieved a 4
kilometres (2.5Â mi) penetration of the line. Rommel immediately counterattacked with
what tanks he had available in an attempt to encircle the pocket during 2 November, but the
heavy Allied fire stopped the attempt. By this time Panzer Army Africa had only one-third of
its initial strength remaining, with only 35 tanks left operational, virtually no fuel or
ammunition and with the British in complete command of the air,Â yet the British armour had
been fought to a standstill, having taken murderous losses with some armoured brigades
reporting losses of 75%.

Rommelâ€™s retreat



On 3 November Montgomery found it impossible to renew his attack, and he had to wait for more
reinforcements to be brought up. This lull was what Rommel needed for his withdrawal, which
had been planned since 29 October, when he had determined the situation hopeless.At midday,
however, Rommel received the infamous â€œvictory or deathâ€� stand-fast order
from Hitler. Although this order demanded the impossible and virtually ensured the
destruction of Panzer Army Africa, Rommel could not bring himself to disobey a direct order
from his FÃŒhrer . The Axis forces held on desperately.

On 4 November Montgomery renewed the attack with fresh forces, and with almost 500 tanks
against the 20 or so remaining to Rommel. By midday the Italian XX Motorized Corps was
surrounded, and several hours later was completely destroyed. This left a 20Â km gap in
Rommelâ€™s line, with British armoured and motorized units pouring through,
threatening the entire Panzer Army Africa with encirclement. At this point Rommel could no
longer uphold the no-retreat order and ordered a general retreat. Early on 5 November he
received authorization by Hitler to withdraw, 12 hours after his decision to do
soâ€”but it was far too late, with only remnants of his army streaming westward. Most of
his unmotorized forces (the bulk of the army) were caught.

Part of the Panzer Army Africa escaped from El Alamein, but this remnant took heavy losses from
constant air attacks. Despite urgings from Hitler and Mussolini, the Panzer Army did not turn
to fight, except for brief holding actions, but withdrew under Allied pressure all the way to
Tunisia . However, the retreat was conducted most skilfully, employingÂ  scorched earth
Â tactics and leaving behindÂ  booby traps , making the task of the pursuers very
difficult. The Allied forces had great numerical superiority and air supremacy, while most
of Rommelâ€™s remaining divisions were reduced to combat groups.

End of Africa campaigns

Having reached Tunisia, Rommel launched an attack against theÂ  U.S. II Corps Â which
was threatening to cut his lines of supply north to Tunis. Rommel inflicted a sharp defeat on
the American forces at theÂ  Kasserine Pass Â in February.

Tunisiaâ€”Rommel talks with German troops who are using a captured American
half-track

Rommel immediately turned back against the British forces, occupying theÂ  Mareth Line
Â (old French defences on the Libyan border). But Rommel could only delay the inevitable.
At the end of January 1943, the Italian GeneralÂ  Giovanni Messe Â had been appointed the
new commander of Rommelâ€™sÂ  Panzer Army Africa Â while Rommel had been at
Kasserine, which was renamed the Italo-German Panzer Army (in recognition of the fact that it
consisted of one German and three Italian corps). Though Messe replaced Rommel, he
diplomatically deferred to him, and the two coexisted in what was theoretically the same
command. On 23 FebruaryÂ  Armeegruppe Afrika Â was created with Rommel in command. It
included the Italo-German Panzer Army under Messe (renamed 1st Italian Army) and the German
5th Panzer Army in the north of Tunisia underÂ  General Hans-JÃŒrgen von Arnim .

The last Rommel offensive in North Africa was on 6 March 1943, when he attacked Eighth Army at
theÂ  Battle of Medenine . The attack was made withÂ  10th ,Â  15th , andÂ  21st
Â Panzer Divisions. Warned byÂ  Ultra Â intercepts, Montgomery deployed large
numbers of anti-tank guns in the path of the offensive. After losing 52 tanks, Rommel called
off the assault. On 9 March he handed over command ofÂ  Armeegruppe Afrika Â to General
Hans-JÃŒrgen von Arnim Â and left Africa, because of health reasons, never to return. On
13 May 1943, General Messe surrendered the remnants ofÂ  Armeegruppe Afrika Â to the
Allies.

Some historians contrast Rommelâ€™s withdrawal to Tunisia against Hitlerâ€™s
wishes withÂ  Friedrich Paulus â€˜s obedience of orders to have the German Sixth Army
Â stand its ground at theÂ  Battle of Stalingrad Â which resulted in its
annihilation.Â  Field Marshal Â  Albert Kesselring , appointed overall Axis commander
in North Africa, saw things differently. He believed the withdrawals, some of which were
carried out against his orders, unnecessary and ruinous since they brought forward British
airfields ever closer to the port of Tunis. As far as he was concerned, Rommel was an
insubordinate defeatist and string-puller. The increasingly acrimonious relations
between the two did nothing to enhance performance.

Role of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) in North Africa



Axis



The Axis had some major SIGINT successes in North Africa. They intercepted the reports of
theÂ  U.S. Â  military attachÃ© Â inÂ  Egypt , who was briefed by the British on
their forces and plans.Some authorities believe this information explains much of
Rommelâ€™s success.

In addition, the Afrika Korps had a Radio Intercept Section (RIS) attached to its HQ. The RIS
monitored radio communications among British units. The British were very
â€œgabbyâ€� and most of this chatter was in clear, that is, uncoded, allowing the
Germans to more easily identify British units and deployments. During the first Battle of El
Alamein, a British counter-attack reached the German HQ. The RIS was wiped out in the fighting
and many of their files captured. This alerted the British to the problem, and they tightened
up on radio chatter. The loss of this resource is considered an important factor in
Rommelâ€™s later lack of success.

Allies



Allied codebreakers read much enciphered German message traffic, especially that
encrypted with theÂ  Enigma machine . ThisÂ  Ultra intelligence included daily reports
from Africa on the numbers and condition of Axis forces. It also included information about
Axis supply shipments across the Mediterranean. This information enabled the weak Allied
air and naval forces there to intercept and destroy much of these shipments. To protect the
source of the intelligence (ULTRA), Allied air and naval forces were forbidden to destroy the
convoys carrying war supplies to North Africa until a flyover to â€œdiscoverâ€�
the convoy was arranged and completed.

The inglorious end of the North African campaign meshed poorly with the Nazi propaganda
machineâ€™s relentless portrayal of Rommel as an unbeatable military genius. This
opened in Berlin the awkward question of precisely what use now to make of the erstwhile Desert
Fox. Back in Germany he was for some time virtually â€œunemployedâ€�. On 23 July
1943 he moved toÂ  Greece Â as commander ofÂ  Army Group E to defend the Greek coast
against a possible Allied landing that never happened, and which the Germans were led to
expect due to the elaborate British deception plan known as â€œ Operation Mincemeat
â€œâ€”only to return to Germany two days later upon the overthrow of Mussolini. On
17 August 1943 Rommel moved his headquarters fromÂ  Munich Â toÂ  Lake Garda Â as
commander of a newÂ  Army Group B Â created to defend northern Italy .

After Hitler gave Kesselring sole Italian command, on 21 November, Rommel moved Army Group B
toÂ  Normandy Â in France with responsibility for defending the French coast against
the long anticipated Allied invasion. He was dismayed by the lack of completed works and the
slow building pace and feared he had just months before an invasion. Rommel reinvigorated the
fortification effort along the Atlantic coast. The Commander-in-Chief West,Â  Gerd von
Rundstedt , expected the Allies to invade in theÂ  Pas-de-Calais Â because it was the
shortest crossing point from Britain, its port facilities were essential to supplying a
large invasion force, and the distance from Calais to Germany was relatively short.
Hitlerâ€™s HQ, although agreeing with this assessment, also considered a landing at
Normandy as a possibility.Â Rommel, believing that Normandy was indeed a likely landing
ground, argued that it did not matter to the Allies where they landed, just that the landing was
successful.He therefore toured the Normandy defenses extensively in January and February
1944. He ordered millions of mines laid and thousands of tank traps and obstacles set up on
beaches and throughout the countryside, including in fields suitable for glider aircraft
landings, the so-calledÂ  Rommelspargel Â (â€œRommelâ€™s
asparagusâ€�).

After his experience with Allied air superiority at the end of the North Africa campaign,
Rommel concluded that future Allied offensives would also enjoy overwhelming Allied air
superiority, exposing any German armoured counter movements to severe punishment from
above. He argued that the tank forces should be dispersed in small units and kept in heavily
fortified positions as close to the front as possible. In doing so they would not have to move
far andÂ  en masse Â when the invasion started.Â He felt their best chance was to
confront the invading force immediately and drive it into the sea. However, von Rundstedt
felt that there was no way to stop the invasion near the beaches due to the equally overwhelming
firepower of the Allied navies. He felt the German armour should be held in reserve well inland
nearÂ  Paris Â where they could be used to counter attack in force in a more traditional
military doctrine. The allies could even be allowed to extend themselves deep into France,
exposing their flanks for a pincer movement to cut off the supplies and retreat of the Allied
troops. This notion of defending France was supported by other officers, most notablyÂ 
Heinz Guderian Â and Panzer Group West commanderÂ  Geyr von Schweppenburg , who
strongly disagreed with Rommel and wanted the armour placed far inland.

â€œ George V â€� in Paris

When asked to pick a plan, Hitler vacillated. In late April, he ordered them placed in the
middle, far enough inland to be useless to Rommel but not far enough for von
Rundstedt.Â Rommel did move some of the armoured formations under his command as far
forward as possible, ordering GeneralÂ  Erich Marcks , commanding the 84th Corps
defending the Normandy section, to move his reserves into the frontline.

The Allies staged elaborate deceptions forÂ  D-Day Â (seeÂ  Operation Fortitude ),
giving the impression that the landings would be at Calais. Although Hitler himself expected
a Normandy invasion for a while, Rommel and most Wehrmacht commanders in France also started
believing in a Pas-de-Calais landing.Â Rommel concentrated fortification building in
theÂ  River Somme Â estuary and let the work in Normandy lag. By D-Day on 6 June 1944
virtually all German officers, including Hitlerâ€™s staff, firmly believed that
Pas-de-Calais was going to be the invasion site.

During the confusing opening hours of D-Day, the German command structure in France was in
disarray. Rommel, and several other important officers were on leave.Â Several tank
units, notably theÂ  12th SS Panzer Division Â andÂ  Panzer-Lehr-Division , were
close enough to the beaches to create serious havoc. The absence of Rommel and continued
confusion in the army and theater HQs led to hesitation in releasing the armoured reserves to
Normandy when they might be needed to meet a second invasion further north. Facing only
small-scale German attacks, the Allies quickly secured aÂ  beachhead . According to the
official history of theÂ  SAS , a British sniper could have killed Rommel, but was ordered
not to, because by that time the allies understood the Germanâ€™s mind and felt they
could anticipate his strategies but not that of his unknown successor.Â Rommel
personally oversaw the bitter fighting aroundÂ  Caen Â where only the determined
defence ofÂ  KampfgruppeÂ  von Luck Â prevented a British breakout on the first day.
Here, again, the on-site commanders were denied freedom of action and the Germans did not
launch a concentrated counterattack until mid-day on 6 June.

The Allies pushed ashore and expanded their beachhead despite the best efforts of
Rommelâ€™s troops. By mid-July the German position was crumbling. On 17 July 1944,
Rommel was being driven along a French road near the front in his staff car. According to a
widely accepted version of events, an RCAFÂ  Spitfire Â ofÂ  412 Squadron
Â piloted byÂ  Charley Fox Â strafed the car nearÂ  Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery
Â and Rommel was injured.Â He was hospitalised with major head injuries. In a different
version, a patrol ofÂ  602 Squadron Â led by Chris Le Roux carried out the
attack.Â Australian Fred Cowlph, of squadron 453, also claims he shot up the Horch
carrying Rommel, . He claims his camera that activated automatically on firing his cannons
verified this. He recorded this action in his aircraft log book.

Plot against Hitler

Main article:Â  20 July plot

There had always been opposition to Hitler in conservative circles and in the Army, theÂ 
Schwarze Kapelle Â (Black Orchestra), but Hitlerâ€™s dazzling successes in
1938â€“1941 had stifled it. However, after the Russian campaign failed, and the Axis
suffered more defeats, this opposition underwent a revival.

Early in 1944, three of Rommelâ€™s closest friendsâ€”, theÂ 
OberbÃŒrgermeister Â of Stuttgart, SAÂ  BrigadefÃŒhrer Â Karl StrÃ¶lin
(who had served with Rommel in the First World War),Â  Alexander von Falkenhausen
Â andÂ  Carl Heinrich von StÃŒlpnagel â€”began efforts to bring Rommel into the
conspiracy. They felt that as by far the most popular officer in Germany, he would lend their
cause badly needed credibility with the populace. Additionally, the conspirators felt they
needed the support of a field marshal on active duty.Â  Erwin von Witzleben , who would have
become commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht if Hitler had been overthrown, was a field
marshal, but had not been on active duty since 1942. Sometime in February, Rommel agreed to
lend his support to the conspiracy in order to, as he put it, â€œcome to the rescue of
Germany.

Rommel, however, opposed assassinating Hitler. After the war, his widowâ€”among
othersâ€”maintained that Rommel believed an assassination attempt would spark civil
war in Germany and Austria and Hitler would have become a martyr for a lasting
cause.Â Instead, Rommel insisted that Hitler be arrested and brought to trial for his
crimes. By the time of his head injuries, Rommel had made up his mind to do his part to get rid of
Hitler.

After the failedÂ  bomb attack of 20 July , many conspirators were arrested and the dragnet
expanded to anyone even suspected of participating. Rommel was fairly perturbed at this
development, tellingÂ  Hans Speidel Â that Hitlerâ€™s behavior after the attack
proved that the dictator had â€œgone completely mad.â€� It did not take long,
however, for Rommelâ€™s involvement to come to light. His name was first mentioned when
StÃŒlpnagel blurted it out after a botched suicide attempt. Later, another
conspirator,Â  Caesar von Hofacker , admitted under particularly severe Gestapo torture
that Rommel was actively involved.

Additionally,Â  Carl Goerdeler , the main civilian leader of the Resistance, wrote on
several letters and other documents that Rommel was a potential supporter and an acceptable
military leader to be placed in a position of responsibility should their coup succeed. Nazi
party officials in France reported that Rommel extensively and scornfully criticised Nazi
incompetence and crimes.

Rommelâ€™s death

A memorial at the site of Field Marshal Erwin Rommelâ€™sÂ  suicide outside of the town
of Herrlingen, Baden-WÃŒrttemberg ,Â  Germany (west ofÂ  Ulm ).

The â€œCourt of Military Honourâ€�â€”aÂ  drumhead court-martial
Â convened to decide the fate of officers involved in the conspiracyâ€”included two
men with whom Rommel had crossed swords before: Heinz Guderian and Gerd von Rundstedt. The
Court decided that Rommel should be expelled from the Army in disgrace and brought beforeÂ 
Roland Freisler â€˜sÂ  Peopleâ€™s Court , aÂ  kangaroo court Â that always
decided in favour of the prosecution. However, Hitler knew that having Rommel branded as a
traitor would severely damage morale on the home front. He and Keitel thus decided to offer
Rommel a chance to commitÂ  suicide .

Rommel was approached at his home byÂ  Wilhelm Burgdorf Â andÂ  Ernst Maisel , two
generals from Hitlerâ€™s headquarters, on 14 October 1944. Burgdorf informed him of
the charges and offered him a choice: he could face the Peopleâ€™s Court or choose to
commit suicide quietly. In the former case, his staff would have been arrested andÂ  his
family would suffer Â even before the all-but-certain conviction and execution. In the
latter case, the government would assure his family fullÂ  pension Â payments and aÂ 
state funeral Â claiming he had died a hero. Burgdorf had brought a capsule of cyanide for
the occasion. After a few minutes alone, Rommel announced that he chose to end his own life and
explained his decision to his wife and son. Carrying his field marshalâ€™s baton,
Rommel went to Burgdorfâ€™sÂ  Opel , driven by SS Master Sergeant Heinrich Doose, and
was driven out of the village. Doose walked away from the car leaving Rommel with Maisel. Five
minutes later Burgdorf gestured to the two men to return to the car, and Doose noticed that
Rommel was slumped over, after taking the cyanide pill. Doose, while sobbing, replaced
Rommelâ€™s fallen cap on his head. Ten minutes later the group phoned Rommelâ€™s
wife to inform her that Rommel was dead.

Rommelâ€™s grave

After the war, an edited version of his diary was published asÂ  The Rommel Papers . He is the
only member of theÂ  Third Reich Â establishment to have a museum dedicated to him. His
grave can be found in Herrlingen, a short distance west ofÂ  Ulm .

The official story of Rommelâ€™s death, as initially reported to the general public,
stated that Rommel had either suffered aÂ  heart attack Â or succumbed to his
injuriesÂ from the earlier strafing of hisÂ  staff car . To further strengthen the
story, Hitler ordered an official day of mourning in commemoration and Rommel was buried with
full military honours. Hitler sent Field Marshal von Rundstedt as his representative at
Rommelâ€™s funeral. Rommel had specified that no political paraphernalia were to be
displayed on his corpse, but the Nazis made sure he was fully festooned with swastikas. The
truth behind Rommelâ€™s death did not come out until Field Marshal Keitel testified
about it during theÂ  Nuremberg Trials .

Rommelâ€™s style as military commander



Logistics and strategy



Rommel was a skilled tactician, but some allege that he had little sense of logistics or
military strategy.Â They consider as an example of this his proposal to postponeÂ 
Operation Herkules , the invasion ofÂ  Malta Â in favour of the immediate advance to the
Suez Canal, which would cut the island off from the western Mediterranean. In the event, the
operation did not take place, and he ran out of supplies in Egypt, principally because
Malta-based forces were sinking Axis supply ships. Those that allege that Rommel had little
sense of logistics think that his eagerness to drive for Egypt, when the necessary logistical
support was lacking, meant that these drives ultimately failed with great losses.

In his analysis of the logistical aspects of the North African Campaign, military
historianÂ  Martin van Creveld Â wrote:

Given that the Wehrmacht was only partly motorized and unsupported by a really strong motor
industry; that the political situation necessitated the carrying of much useless Italian
ballast; that the capacity of the Libyan ports was so small, the distances to be mastered so
vast; it seems clear that, for all of Rommelâ€™s tactical brilliance, the problem of
supplying an Axis force for an advance into the Middle East was insoluble. â€Š
Rommelâ€™s repeated defiance of his orders and attempts to advance beyond a reasonable
distance from his bases, however, was mistaken and should never have been tolerated.

Personality



Contemporaries who had to work with him under adversity often had very few kind words to say
about him and his abilities. Following Paulusâ€™ return from his inspection of
Rommelâ€™s doings in North Africa and also considering the reports submitted by Alfred
Gause, Halder concluded: â€œRommelâ€™s character defects make him very hard to
get along with but no one cares to come out in open opposition because of his brutality and the
backing he has at top level.â€� Others mentioned his leadership style, which expected
much of his commanders, while not being open to criticism or objections.Â He had little
patience for sub-commanders who did not do their jobs properly. Only three weeks after
assuming command of the 7th Panzer Division in February 1940, Rommel found a battalion
commander performing below par and had the man relieved of command and sent on his way in 90
minutes.Â This management style would certainly send a signal that he demanded the utmost
of his men, but it was bound to create a feeling of resentment among some of his officers.

F. W. von Mellenthin , who served on Rommelâ€™s staff during the Africa campaign, wrote
that Rommel took great chances on several occasions, gambling entire battles on decisions
made almost on the spur of the moment and with incomplete information. He cited
Rommelâ€™s counterattack during OperationÂ  Crusader Â as just one such
instance.Â Others who served under him in Africa, most notably General Fritz Bayerlein,
said he took risks but only after carefully weighing the potential dangers and
rewards.Â Rommel himself was aware of his growing reputation as a gambler and added
careful notes in his papers explaining and defending his actions, especially concerning his
decision to drive into Egypt during the 1942 Summer Offensive.

While some aggressive subordinates, likeÂ  Hans von Luck , praised his leadership from the
front,Â Mellenthin questioned this leadership style as it often led to disinvolvement of
his staff officers in the fight instead of their maintaining an overview of the situation. His
consequential long absences from HQ also meant that subordinates had to make decisions
without consulting Rommel, leading to confusion.

Rommel was a teetotaler and a non-smoker.

Relations with the Italians



Rommelâ€™s relations with the Italian High Command in North Africa were in the worst
possible terms. That is hardly surprising, as Rommel was nominally subordinate to the
Italians for much of the campaign but was also direct commander of the DAK, by far the strongest
component of the Axis forces, and enjoyed direct access and the strongest relationships with
the highest German political authority. This allowed him to ignore blatantly any sort of
order or even simple advice coming from his Italian counterparts, and Rommelâ€™s
abrasive and often impolite manners did nothing to smoothe the resentment that this
perceived insubordination and lack of respect generated in his Italian allies.

The belated expedient to nominate Field Marshall Kesselring as Supreme Commander
Mediterranean, to act as a buffer between Rommel and the Italians, failed miserably, as
Rommel quite simply ignored Kesselring exactly as he ignored the Italians.

Besides Rommelâ€™s impolite manners and insubordination, there were also strong
professional points of disagreements, mostly related to the handling of the logistical part
of the campaign. While certainly much less proficient than Rommel in their tactical outlook
and mobile warfare skills, the Italian commanders were competent â€œold
schoolâ€� professionals, with full staff training and a sound grasp of logistics and
artillery doctrine, that is the true weak points of Rommel professional preparation. As such
the Italian commanders were repeatedly at odds with Rommel, particularly when their
conservative logistical calculations â€“ regularly ignored by Rommel â€“ were
actually confirmed as accurate, leaving the Axis forces stranded in exposed position from
where the Italians â€“ with their puny motorized resources â€“ were much less able
than the Germans to extricate themselves

This generated a widespread lack of respect among the Italian commanders for
Rommelâ€™s professional skills in anything but tactical situation, that further
ruined any possibility of implementing good working relations. This lack of trust reached
its acme during the retreat up to Tunisia after the El Alamein battle, when an utterly spent and
dispirited Rommel eluded all requests by the Italians to stand up and attempt to fight in
defence of Libya on the favourable traditional back-up line at the el Agheila bottleneck or
even before the main logistical base of Tripoli, a fact that the Italian commanders did
consider just short of outright cowardice and treason.

Much different was the perception of Rommel among the Italian common soldiers and lower
officers, that reserved for him the highest sort of admiration and respect.

Aggression and tactical capability



In France, Rommelâ€™s aggressive drive through the French and British lines,
disregarding the safety of his flanks and rear, succeeded to a remarkable degree. His bold
attacks often caused larger enemy formations to surrender but his aggressiveness did cause
resentment among fellow officers, however, who felt he at times acted too recklessly and
failed to keep his sub-commanders and colleague commanders properly informed of his
intentions. He was also criticized for claiming too much of the glory himself, neglecting
support from other elements of the Wehrmacht and downplaying other unitsâ€™
achievements.

British GeneralÂ  Harold Alexander Â commanded Allied forces in the Middle East facing
Rommel in Egypt (from August 1942) and later commandedÂ  18th Army Group Â inÂ 
Tunisia . In his official despatch on the campaign in Africa, he wrote of RommelÂ : He was a
tactician of the greatest ability, with a firm grasp of every detail of the employment of
armour in action, and very quick to seize the fleeting opportunity and the critical turning
point of a mobile battle. I felt certain doubts, however, about his strategic ability, in
particular as to whether he fully understood the importance of a sound administrative plan.
Happiest while controlling a mobile force directly under his own eyes he was liable to
overexploit immediate success without sufficient thought for the future.

SirÂ  David Hunt , one of Alexanderâ€™s intelligence officers, expressed the view in
his own book that: â€Šhis real gift was for commanding an armoured regiment, perhaps a
division, and that his absolute ceiling was an armoured corps.

During the siege of Tobruk, Rommel launched frequent costly attacks during the first month of
the siege. The level of losses incurred caused Rommel to have several arguments with his unit
commanders, and also with the German High Command. Indeed, some sources indicate that Chief
of StaffÂ  Halder Â had to send Friedrich Paulus to Africa to rein Rommel in, although
Rommel himself maintained he had realized the futility of further attacks on the fortress on
his own accord.

Popular perception



Rommel was extraordinarily well known in his lifetime, not only by the German people, but also
by his adversaries. Popular stories of his chivalry and tactical prowess earned him the
respect of many opponents, includingÂ  Claude Auchinleck ,Â  Winston Churchill ,Â 
George S. Patton , andÂ  Bernard Montgomery . Rommel reciprocated their respect; for
instance, he said Montgomery â€œnever made a serious strategic mistakeâ€� and
credited Patton with â€œthe most astounding achievement in mobile warfare.Â Hitler
counted Rommel among his favorite generals. Rommel was among the few Axis commanders (others
beingÂ  Isoroku Yamamoto Â andÂ  Reinhard Heydrich ) directly targeted for
assassination by Allied planners. However, unlike the other two, theÂ  attempt Â on
Rommelâ€™s life was a failure.

TheÂ  Afrika Korps Â were never accused of any war crimes, and Rommel himself referred to
the fighting in North Africa asÂ  Krieg ohne Hass â€”war without hate. Numerous
examples exist of Rommelâ€™s chivalry towards AlliedÂ  POWs , such as his defiance of
Hitlerâ€™s infamousÂ  Commando Order Â following the capture of Lt. Roy
Woodridge and Lt.Â  George Lane Â as part ofÂ  Operation Fortitude . He also refused to
comply with Hitlerâ€™s order to execute Jewish POWs.

During Rommelâ€™s time in France, Hitler ordered him to deport the countryâ€™s
Jewish population; Rommel disobeyed. Several times he wrote letters protesting against the
treatment of the Jews. When British MajorÂ  Geoffrey Keyes Â was killed during a failed
commando raid to kill or capture Rommel behind German lines, Rommel ordered him buried with
full military honours. Also, during the construction of theÂ  Atlantic Wall , Rommel
directed that French workers were not to be used as slaves, but were to be paid for their labour.

His military colleagues also played their part in perpetuating his legend. His former
subordinate Kircheim, though privately critical of Rommelâ€™s performance,
nonetheless explained: â€œthanks to propaganda, first by Goebbels, then by
Montgomery, and finally, after he was poisoned (sic), by all former enemy powers, he has
become a symbol of the best military traditions. â€ŠAny public criticism of this
legendary personality would damage the esteem in which the German soldier is held.â€�

After the war, when Rommelâ€™s alleged involvement in the plot to kill Hitler became
known, his stature was enhanced greatly among the former Allied nations. Rommel was often
cited in Western sources as a general who, though a loyal German, was willing to stand up to
Hitler. The release of the filmÂ  The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel Â (1951) helped to
further enhance his reputation as one of the most widely known and well-regarded leaders in
theÂ  German Army . In 1970 aÂ  LÃŒtjens -class destroyer Â was named theÂ  Rommel
Â in his honour.

Quotations about Rommel



TheÂ  British Parliament Â considered a censure vote againstÂ  Winston Churchill
Â following the surrender atÂ  Tobruk . The vote failed, but in the course of the debate,
Churchill stated: We have a very daring and skillful opponent against us, and, may I say across
the havoc of war, a great general.

Churchill again: He also deserves our respect, because, although a loyal German soldier, he
came to hate Hitler and all his works, and took part in the conspiracy to rescue Germany by
displacing the maniac and tyrant. For this, he paid the forfeit of his life. In the sombre wars
of modern democracy, there is little place for chivalry.

Theodor Werner Â was an officer who, during World War I, served under Rommel: Anybody who
came under the spell of his personality turned into a real soldier. However tough the strain he
seemed inexhaustible. He seemed to know what the enemy were like and how they would react.

British GeneralÂ  Claude Auchinleck , one of Rommelâ€™s opponents in Africa, in a
letter to his field commanders: There exists a real danger that our friend Rommel is becoming a
kind of magical or bogey-man to our troops, who are talking far too much about him. He is by no
means a superman, although he is undoubtedly very energetic and able. Even if he were a
superman, it would still be highly undesirable that our men should credit him with
supernatural powersâ€Š [ending the memo with] I am not jealous of Rommel.
