So Cal Birding Surprises

By Mike • March 25, 2008 • 9 comments

Finding efficient ways to fit birding into business travel has me on the hunt for ideal
locations as close to airports as possible. So far, my two favorites have been Jamaica Bay
right down the road from JFK and Arrowhead Marsh practically connected to the car rental lots
at the Oakland airport. Now, to add to this collection, I’ve discovered a clutch little
coastal area just a stone’s throw from LAX!

Willet

I recently had the opportunity to pursue some Southern California birding with my friend
Sherry of Conservation Calling . Sherry is among that breed of entrepreneur who seeks to align
market success with social good. Since nature is her cause and, pardon the pun, calling, she
and I had much to discuss as we surveyed the secret sites of Los Angeles birding. I can now attest
that the waterfowl at Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area are as nonplussed by photographers
as I’ve come to expect on the West Coast and further that Franklin Canyon Park seems like an
auspicious slice of chaparral, grasslands and oak woodlands between the San Fernando Valley
and Beverly Hills. However, our best birding lay along the Pacific Coast.

If I had to offer a criticism of A Birder’s Guide to Southern California , it would be that its
treatment of Los Angeles birding is rather skimpy. Nonetheless, the author does highlight
two interlinked birding treasures: Ballona Wetlands and Playa Del Rey . Playa Del Rey is the
beachfront community sandwiched betwixt Los Angeles International Airport and the Pacific
Ocean. That might make this zipcode less desirable to residents repulsed by the incessant
drone of airplanes overhead, but it doesn’t seem to bother the birds. Gulls like Western ,
California , and Ring-billed were quite common along the sandy shore, as were Willets .
Offshore bobbed scores of satisfied Western and Eared Grebes mixed in with Bufflehead and
Surf Scoter . The real action here can be found around a network of jetties you’ve probably
seen from above when flying from LAX. The rocks close to shore sheltered communities of Least
Sandpipers , Black Turnstones , and Surfbirds . Further out, the big breakwater standing
between Marina Del Rey and the sea supports a community of Brown Pelicans , gulls, cormorants,
and who knows what else. I don’t know because I didn’t have a scope which explains why I was
able to confirm Brandt’s Cormorant but not Pelagic .

Least Sandpipers

Not only did Playa Del Rey offer more interesting birding than any unbroken stretch of Pacific
sand could, the neighborhood pond served up some bonus prizes in Del Rey Lagoon Park. Here I saw
an abundance of Greater White-fronted Geese along with the most perfect opportunity to
compare Canada and Cackling Geese imaginable. Picture if you can a lone Canada Goose (that
should be easy) gliding across the surface of a pond. Now enter this goose in a synchronized
swimming competition partnered with a bird only half its size. When the Canada and cackler
match each other stroke for stroke that closely, every difference between the two stands out.
From the bill profile alone, it was a cinch to separate them from at least a hundred feet away.
Too bad this doesn’t happen more often.

The Ballona Wetlands, perhaps the last significant coastal wetlands area in the Los Angeles
basin, is also conveniently located near the airport. At first glance, the unassuming parcel
of tall grass and marsh may seem quiet but the folks who fight to preserve this ecosystem from
developers have placed at least 215 bird species within its verdant confines. With little
time to truly scrutinize the wetlands, I mostly observed common species like Black Phoebe ,
Yellow-rumped Warbler , and Red-winged Blackbird . However, one small shorebird winging
through a tangle of vegetation got my heart racing, its distinctive profile one I’d only
seen before in field guides and other people’s photos. Assuring Sherry we had something
special here, I finally got my bins on a beautiful Wilson’s Snipe , my first ever!

Wilson’s Snipe

So Cal birding is always a blast, particularly when it involves new sites and new birds. For me,
though, the best part was spending time with someone I only ever speak with online. It may not be
your good fortune to run into Sherry on the birding trail, but you should check out the bird and
wildlife ringtones, wallpapers, and mobile games she’s got cooking over at Conservation
Calling . And if you ever have a few hours to kill in a layover at LAX, don’t forget about Playa
Del Rey and Ballona Wetlands!

    Congrats on finally nailing that snipe! I went to AZ with Brad Schram (author of the So Cal
    guide) back in 2003. He’s an unbelievable birder and a great guy.

    Does Corey still have your scope???

    No more snipe hunts for you!

    And Patrick, I gave the scope back quite some time ago, though I might have to try to get it
    back…

    What happened to snipes in North America?

    When I spent a year close to Toronto / Ontario in 1987/88, snipes were common. I saw them
    over our house in display flight, they were on every grassy puddle besides the road in
    urban parks etc. during migration, I basically flushed them in every area that had a bit of
    grass and at least a minimum amount of water.

    I have, however, barely seen a snipe in May 2005 or in my Michigan year 2006/07.

    Where are they?

    Patrick, I’m afraid Corey became too attached to the scope. I had to take it back for his
    own good.

    Jochen, since my success rate with snipes has been so poor with this one exception, I can
    only surmise they’re all in Ballona Wetlands. My further conjecture is that there’s
    no such thing as an American Woodcock.

    Jochen Mar 26th, 2008 at 7:23 am

    Well, as this place seems to be rather smallish, I sure hope you’re wrong!

    American Woodcock?

    Ever tried Crane Creek, Ohio in May?

    After all, if all the Snipe hang around Ballona Wetlands, the woodcocks have to use an
    alternative place, right?

    Can’t make it too easy for you east coast birders, or else the fun would be spoilt.

    give me a shout and I’d be happy to show you around

Is Bird Banding Controversial?



I was under the impression that bird banding or ringing was universally appreciated as a
valuable instrument in the ornithological arsenal. Â Apparently, not everyone agrees .
Help clarify this issue… is there widespread controversy around banding or simply slight
opposition?

Parrotlets Name Their Babies



Parrots in the wild are always awesome, but parrotlets hold a special place in many hearts,
including mine. Here’s something else to love about these petite pocket parrots:
Grrlscientist reports that Green-rumped Parrotlets name their babies . Cool, right? And I
suspect the population studied is this group studied by Nick Sly back in 2008.
