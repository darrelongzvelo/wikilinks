Superleague (Russian: Ð’ÐŸÐ»ÐµÐ¹Ð±ÐŸÐ»ÑŒÐœÐ°Ñ�

sports betting sites. There is a menâ€™s Superleague and also a womenâ€™s
Superleague that has some of the best Russian volleyball clubs competing against one
another.

History of Russian Superleague

The Russian Superleague is an annual sporting event for the volleyball clubs from all over
Russia. The league has been the most popular club volleyball tournament for almost 20 years
now. With the Russian Volleyball Superleague 2009-10 season, the competition has
officially completed 19 years. In these 19 years, CSKA Moscow and Belogorie-Dynamo Belgorod
had won the championship thrice. Avtomobilist Saint Petersburg, Zenit Kazan and Dynamo
Moscow won the cup twice.

had won the championship four times in a row in the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. In the last
season, which was held in the year 2010, Zenit Kazan had become champions for the second time,
while Lokomotiv Belogorie Belgorod was the 1st runners up and Dynamo Moscow the second.

The last season of the womenâ€™s Russian volleyball Superleague had 12 clubs
participating. Of them, Zarechie-Odintsovo emerged victorious, Dinamo Moscow was second
and Dinamo Krasnodar came third.

The Russian Superleague format

The game format of the Russian Superleague is the same for both men and womenâ€™s
championships. The tournament has two stages â€“ the preliminary round and the final
round. There are twelve teams each that take part in the menâ€™s and the womenâ€™s
competitions. Each team plays every other team twice in the prelims, also referred to as the
regular season, once in a home game and once away. Each team plays a total of 22 games and the top
eight teams from the preliminary round move on to the playoffs.

The playoffs include the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final championship round. In
the quarterfinals, two teams play each other thrice and the leading teams move into the semi
finals. Again, depending on their standings at the end of the quarterfinals, two teams play
three matches to decide the finalists. The final is a best of four games and the leading team
becomes the champions. A set of four games are played between the losing teams in the
semifinals, to determine the 3rd and the 4th places.
