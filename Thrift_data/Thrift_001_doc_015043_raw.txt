Two Years Blogging + Lunch @ Sauciety



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/SBc3XGkYCGI/AAAAAAAABXA/CTxp4a6wbPI/s400/menu+forks+glasses+(2).jpg

Today is my two year blog anniversary! I cannot believe that time has passed so quickly. One of
the best things about blogging is meeting so many new fun people .



Yesterday I had the best time meeting up with another one of my favorite bloggers. T from the
blog Notes of an Anesthesioboist ! T is just as lovely and fun as I thought she would be from
reading her blog. She's an anesthesiologist and writes about work, but she also started
playing the oboe and writes about that too and all sorts of other interesting things. She loves
to travel and has a sweet tooth just like me. We were both completely on the same page when it came
to the menu. Dessert! That was our number one priority.



But first I have to tell you how we ended up where we ended up. You know I'm always having random
adventures and yesterday was no different. Okay, so of course I was running late and ended up
having to drive instead of taking the T, otherwise I would not have made it into Boston on time. I
was hoping that I'd be able to find a parking space in the garage near where I work, but it was
full. So I called T and asked her if I could pick her up in front of the cafe where we had planned to
eat. We could then decide what to do. I felt so bad, because at this point, T has never met me and
I'm really just a random person and she suddenly had to get into my car.



Well, my Beetle isn't very scary, so she hopped in anyway. We were in the middle of a ton of
traffic and it took about three tries just to make it through one light. I suggested that we head
over to the Fort Point Channel area, because there are supposed to be a lot of restaurants and
there would be parking. So it's grey and foggy and rainy out and we're driving down Summer
Street.



T noticed that there was a Westin Hotel with a parking garage. She said that they usually have
really good restaurants. So we pulled into the garage, go upstairs and ask if they have a
restaurant. We were directed to Sauciety . Now we had planned to just have a simple lunch and all
of a sudden we were going to a really nice restaurant with well-dressed business traveller
type people. We were both dressed rather casually. Neither of us even knew there was a Westin
there. The interior is really pretty - wide open spaces with trees and very modern furniture.





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/SBc1W2kYCFI/AAAAAAAABW4/zgoNvxTCVUs/s400/sauciety+sign+(2).jpg



Because T is anonymous on her blog and we didn't plan on any fine dining, I didn't bring my
camera. I was just going to take a few shots of our meal with my camera phone, so these aren't the
best pictures. By now I should know to always bring my camera no matter what. Lesson learned
again!



At this point, we are laughing and can't believe the little adventure that we've had and that we
wound up at The Westin. It was so incredibly random. We spoke about how sometimes in life you end
up in a place far different than you ever planned, but that maybe you end up where you're
supposed to be. So we were meant to be in elegant surroundings.



When you walk to the entrance of Sauciety , instead of a regular sign, they have the name
projected in lights on the wall. It looks far better than my picture. We asked to look at the
menu. We were given the lunch menu , which looked fine, but we were both rather alarmed that we
didn't see any dessert. We asked about it and were given a dessert menu . It looked amazing! T
decided on the crÃšme bruleÃ© trio and I knew that I had to try the cappuccino intrigue .



So based on the dessert, we decided to go in. Again, with our focus being on the dessert, we
decided to use our calories wisely and split the market salad with champagne vinaigrette and
the crispy calamari . I just can't get excited over salad when there's dessert to talk about,
but the vinaigrette was quite tasty. The calamari was good, but extremely salty, so I only had a
few pieces.





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/SBc-C2kYCHI/AAAAAAAABXI/GR168Bz0xlk/s400/dessert+collage.jpg



Oh and I almost forgot about our waiter! He brought us the bill while we were eating. Isn't he
supposed to upsell with dessert? Maybe he was so disappointed in us, because we both only had
water for drinks and we split appetizers. So we told him we wanted dessert and he gave us both
very disapproving looks. That was really odd. Did he think we didn't deserve dessert?



Anyway, we got our desserts and they were both wonderful! I don't think I can quite capture the
intrigue of the cappuccino intrigue . When you get to the middle, you suddenly see the
chocolate sauce dribbling out. Ah, the intrigue! It was so fun! I especially wanted to capture
it in a picture, but maybe when T writes up her post, her pictures will be better. She did bring
her camera. So that was my lunch adventure with T . I hope we can do it again soon.



*Updated* - T has written up a fun post about our meet-up. Read it here .

Subway Stories - Couples



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/SBHdgWkYCEI/AAAAAAAABWw/I-OMoRXZdTs/s400/South+Station+Entrance.jpg



I haven't written any tales from the T in quite some time, because nothing particularly
remarkable has happened. Well I don't know what was in the air last night or in the stars, but I
couldn't help but noticing three couples arguing. Maybe they weren't arguing, but just
having animated conversations at a heightened volume. I don't know.



Walking down Summer Street towards South Station, to my left I heard a woman talking rather
loudly. She said, "You always do that!" Then he denied it. She was tall and they were both
wearing very casual clothes. I was walking really fast, so I didn't hear much else. Then at the
entrance to South Station to my right, a dressed up couple was talking really loudly too. I was
more focused on making my train than listening to them, so I couldn't hear what they were
saying. I should have lingered a bit, because I waited twenty minutes for the train.



When I got out at Wollaston, there was another couple at the entrance talking loudly. But they
could have just been playing around, because they seemed to be sort of wrestling with each
other. It's interesting seeing these little snapshots of people's lives.



My curiosity about the possible planetary influences last night got the best of me, so I just
found an astrological prediction for yesterday. There was something going on! Look here .
Below is an excerpt from KT theAstrologer at BlogHer.

"Well, it’s here at last — Mars opposing Jupiter. About ten days ago I posted a list of
keyword phrases for these two can-do planets. At the risk of being repetitive, here are just a
few of the myriad possibilities for the energy being created today: increased aggression and
pushing things too far."

Did anyone else notice these types of interactions last night?

Happy Earth Day!

I couldn't let Earth Day pass without saying something about the day. Our planet certainly is
in peril, so I'm sure that most of us are trying to make changes, no matter how small, whenever we
can.



I stopped buying bottled water and bought a reusable plastic bottle. Although now with the
current discussion about the dangers of plastic bottles containing BPA , I may have to replace
this bottle with a safer one. I've only recently become aware of these dangers even though
articles like this one were discussing it back in 2003. I'll have to do some searching for a safe
reusable plastic bottle.



In this post from last year , I mentioned that I bought some bamboo sheets, which are supposed to
be environmentally friendly. Although, this article adds some doubt to all the green claims.
Anyway, I really like these sheets . They are very soft, cool in the summer, and warm in the
winter.



In the end, I don't know how much my green efforts help the earth. It seems that for every good
that I intend, there is often a downside too. All I can do is keep trying. Kermit knew what he was
talking about when he said that it wasn't easy being green .

The Philadelphia Brand

When I think about the Philadelphia Sound , the first song that comes to my mind is Disco Inferno
by The Trammps . I loved that song! The refrain, "Burn baby burn" and those horns playing in the
background are ingrained in memories of my youth. Watch the video here and enjoy a real
classic.



According to the Wikipedia entry, the song first came out in 1976, which I remember as being the
year of the Bicentennial . The 4th of July was huge that year! I think that my parents brought me
and my brother to Plimouth Plantation at one point and also to see the Tall Ships. It seemed like
that summer was filled with activity and music and fun. I remember wanting to see the Liberty
Bell in Philadelphia . We didn't go and I've still never seen it. Philadelphia is also the
hometown of two of my favorite artists, Jill Scott and Will Smith . What is it about
Philadelphia?

Well last night, I came home from work and made Raspberry-Cream Cheese Muffins . See the
original recipe here . Many of my groceries are the store brand, because they are cheaper and
usually taste the same as the more expensive brands. As I was combining the ingredients, I
realized that I was NOT using Philadelphia Cream Cheese ! That brand really sticks in your
mind. And I think I even saw one of their angel commercials while I was watching Medium . Love
that show!



Then of course, today is the Pennsylvania Primary . The day we Democrats have anticipated for
more than a month. Subconsciously politics and food get combined in my head. Or maybe food and
everything get combined in my head? Hmmm. Well, I don't expect Obama to win today, but I hope
that the votes will be close. Maybe even a tie. Now wouldn't that be something? By the way, these
muffins are delicious.

Beans + Sprouts



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/SA3BoGkYB6I/AAAAAAAABVg/yAL0GDpLUN0/s400/sprouts+%2B+beans+cooked.jpg

Back in the fall, I saw this post for a quick vegetable dish and filed it away to try later.
Recently I started thinking about a can of cannellini beans that I had sitting in my cupboard. I
also had some Brussel sprouts. Then I remembered this recipe.





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/SA3CHWkYB7I/AAAAAAAABVo/wrAQNphSrCs/s400/veggies+in+collander.jpg



I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I sauteed the rinsed beans and quartered sprouts in a
little butter, sesame oil, and some lemon olive oil too. I added just a pinch of salt and
sprinkled some pepper. These are really good and the colors are warm and Spring-like. I'll
definitely make them again soon.

Dreaming About The Candidates

I just found the coolest blog and had to share it with you guys. Click here to see it.



It's called The Metaphysical Poll and it's broken into three different blogs. You can read
random peoples' dreams about the presidential candidates. If you had a dream about either one
of them, or the election in general, you can submit yours and share it with the world.



Check out I Dream of Barack , I Dream of Hillary , and I Dream of McCain .



After everyone watching the debate tonight, I'm sure many of us may just find ourself dreaming
about one of them.



There is even some dream analysis. Here is a portion edited for clarity.



"Analyzed in these terms, the most frequent emotions in the Hillary dreams are fear (34) and
confusion (34), followed by happiness (23), sadness (16), and anger (15).



For Barack, the most frequent emotion is happiness (35), then confusion (28), fear (20),
anger (16), and sadness (9)...



W]hat stands out is the high happiness and low fear in the Barack dreams and the high confusion
in the Hillary dreams. No one would deny, I think, that Hillary’s campaign has been
surprised by Obama’s rise and unsure of how to regain her once formidable lead.



Nor could anyone who’s attended an Obama rally dispute the idea that he’s trying to banish
people’s fears and stimulate their hopes. Perhaps one could say the Barack dreamers are too
happy and not scared enough—that’s a charge made by his “realist” critics."

I'm getting ready to go to sleep and it's definitely NOT 3:00 am. I wonder if I'll dream about the
debate? Did any of you?

Waffling On Tax Day

No, I didn't waffle on filing my taxes. They are finally done! But I did make waffles for
breakfast. And since they are a nice golden color, I thought they'd be perfect for my
submission to A Taste Of Yellow .

I Like Cookie Dough More Than Cookies



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/SAIh8EqMunI/AAAAAAAABUY/5fpPxpFfJo0/s400/cookie+dough.jpg

This reminds me of a confession that I should be sending to PostSecret . But it's my truth and I
own it.



If you've never visited PostSecret , it's a pretty interesting phenomenon, but kind of tragic
sometimes. This post grossed me out. Why did it have to be about cookbooks?



This CVS post I found quite funny in particular. The CVS Coupon Post that I wrote has given me
more hits on this blog than any other. It's the post that keeps on giving. However the bitter
anonymous comments are starting to pile up and I don't know how to respond to them anymore.



And yes, I did say bitter . Hopefully I won't have to explain myself later like Obama. The
controversey is now being referred to as Bitter-gate . The insanity of this campaign is
astonishing.



And I just learned via Jack & Jill Politics that a new website has just gone up called Bitter
Voters For Obama ! Their motto is the following.

"Bitter, and proud of it. Clinton says we're 'resilient,' but we can't take it any more. McCain
says 'let em eat Lemons,' but what we really need is a leader who can turn lemons into lemonade:
Barack Obama." That sounds good to me! They're even selling T-shirts already. Well, God bless
America.



And moving from the bitter turning to sweet, back to the really sweet, here is the recipe for the
cookie dough. Or cookies if you must bake them. I cut the amounts in half, except I kept the
amount of almond extract the same. I used white chocolate chips and didn't have any almonds.
Enjoy!

Not Mine



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/R_zW9553roI/AAAAAAAABUI/tPCe8UmUg0A/s200/Receipt.jpg

If you checked out my most recent post on Leap183 , you'll see a few plastic and paper bags on the
floor. For my normal weekly grocery shopping I go to Stop & Shop . I always ask for paper and
plastic. I hate when they don't after I ask. My reason is so that the bags are sturdy enough to
make it all the way from my car and up the stairs to my apartment. I've had several rips with just
plain single paper or single plastic. It's not fun. Also, instead of buying trash bags, I
re-use the grocery bags.



Another use for the bags is to cover the floor when I repot my plants. Which I did on Monday with
one plant that had not been repotted for at least four years. It was really time. Anyway, when I
was grabbing a bag, this store receipt fell out. My first thought was that I hadn't seen it
before, so I didn't deduct the amount from my check book. Eeek!



Luckily I looked at the total, which was way more than I spend and I didn't recognize the types of
items. Shortbread cookies from the Bakeshop and Dark Ring Ding Jr. I didn't even know Dark Ring
Ding Jr.'s existed! They do sound good though! I don't think I've bought Ring Dings since high
school. I used to love most of the Drake's Cakes - Yodels and Devil Dogs too. I ate one of Drake's
Cakes everyday during Study. Those are some nice memories actually...



And I loved the shortbread cookies that I made , but I'm not usually a huge fan and probably
wouldn't buy them at the store. Especially since they're so easy to make. For the rare times
when I buy cookies at the store, it's usually chocolate-chip because I need them immediately.



So after this thorough food analysis, I realized that this was not my receipt. Also, there are
beef baby back ribs and I don't eat beef. It's funny what you can learn about someone from what
they buy or don't buy at the grocery store. I always find it fascinating what other people put
into their carts. And people have commented on things that I've bought too. Rice milk for
instance. One of the cashiers asked me a ton of questions.



Do you notice what's in other peoples' carts or look at the food in front of yours at the
register? Do you ever look at the person to match them up with their food? Does it look like
that's what they actually eat? Maybe it's just me...



I just learned via my cousin Enyasi , that the James Beard Award Nominees were recently
announced. Now this is a nice reference list if you plan to do some cookbook shopping. I'm going
to go take another look.



*Updated 4/11/08* - Suldog's comment reminded me of this cool blog and book that has
collections of peoples' grocery lists. Find it here .

What would happen if ...



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/R_q-mZ53rfI/AAAAAAAABS8/P2X2Pg-0H-8/s400/SVC3.jpg

If I tried to make a slightly healthier version of my adapted version of the famous Swedish
Visiting Cake . And what if I used a smaller and taller pan to make it even cuter?





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/R_rBmZ53rgI/AAAAAAAABTE/PfO0J9HfElU/s400/SVC4.jpg



This is what happened. It's a mini-cake! Or a GIGANTIC cupcake! And it was still really good.
I'm having so much fun with this cake. Below is the recipe at the moment. I'm sure I'll think of
something new to do with it next week. I think I'm becoming obsessed with this recipe.



It's getting to be almost as bad as the World Peace Cookies ! I'm going to refer to my version of
this cake as the Pi version, because I think that I'll be baking and adapting this cake
infinitum.



Swedish Visiting Cake - The Pi Version

( Adapted from Dorie Greenspan )



1/2 stick unsalted butter = 4T or 1/4 cup (melted)

1/4 cup vanilla yogurt

1/4 cup Splenda

scant 3/4 cup sugar

2 eggs

2 tsp. vanilla extract

1/4 tsp. salt

1 cup flour

scant 1/4 cup sweetened flaked coconut (for topping)



Combine all ingredients except for coconut in medium bowl. Stir well. I used a large ceramic
ramekin to bake this. I think that's still the correct term even if it's not individually
sized. Please correct me if I'm wrong. It took longer than before to bake - close to an hour at 350
degrees.



Let cool before removing from pan. Top with coconut and admire the sheer cuteness of this
little cake.



*Updated* Starbucks is giving out free coffee tomorrow! Below is an excerpt from this press
release .

"Visit any participating U.S. Starbucks store on Tuesday, April 8 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (12
p.m. Eastern Time) and Starbucks will give all customers a complimentary short (8 oz.) cup of
the new Pike Place Roast™ to enjoy as they participate in a simultaneous, nationwide,
coast-to-coast, coffee tasting conducted by Starbucks coffee experts."

Hopefully all tips will go to the, ahem, correct parties.

Chai Tea Oatmeal



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/R_ZQIJ53rcI/AAAAAAAABSk/Q4wR0dW6_6Y/s400/chai+oatmeal.jpg

Last night I made some chai tea. Not real chai tea. I have tea bags. I do plan on making some from
scratch soon though. I've been saving recipes for the past few weeks.



So anyway, I use vanilla rice milk and add a chai tea bag. I was so tired last night, I forgot that I
was steeping the tea until I was ready to go to sleep. So I just put some plastic wrap over the cup
and stuck it in the fridge.



This morning, I was making my oatmeal and getting ready to put in the rice milk. I figured that
I'd try the chai tea instead. It's really good! I added some raisins and brown sugar and the
oatmeal had some extra spice. Plus the smell was wonderful. Just another idea to add some
excitement to your morning oatmeal.



*Updated 1/2/10* This is old news, but this photo is on TasteSpotting too!

A Free Burrito!



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EaTrs3A_q_c/R_RAvZ53rbI/AAAAAAAABSc/Hv0GQEPEQdA/s400/Chipotle.jpg

I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food. I do enjoy it, but I usually don't crave it like I do Italian or
seafood. When I got home from work today, I received the usual junk mail and bills, but I also
received this very stylish advertisement, well more like an invitation. It was addressed to
"Resident" so it wasn't really for me personally, but I do reside here and will take free stuff
where I can get it.



To whoever designed this campaign, "Good job!" I'm assuming that the restaurant Chipotle
sent these out to everyone in the area. I don't live near Brighton and I'm usually not in that
area, but the next time I'm sort of in the area, I think I'll stop by Chipotle to take a look and a
taste. The menu looks very simple, but good. Have any of you tried this place?
