Let us analyze the facts of the hypothetical one rule at a time and consider the impact of all six of the key rules: Rule 1.1 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Competence; Rule 1.3 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Diligence; Rule 1.6 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Confidentiality; Rule 3.2 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Expediting Litigation; Rule 3.3 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Candor Toward the Tribunal; and, Rule 3.4 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <strong>Competence.</strong>\n              The competency issue here is critical, as it is in most ethical considerations. One party here, the plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel, does not really understood e-discovery. For instance, they did not really understand many of the technical reasons behind defendant\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s position, such as deduplication and email copies throughout the system, nor the sampling disclosures. They did not understand the benefits of phased discovery and going first for the low hanging fruit, the emails of the best key custodians.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img height="240" width="194" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cavemen2.jpg?w=194&amp;h=240" title="cavemen, simple fight or flight reactions" class="alignright wp-image-16977"></img>\n              They did not cooperate in e-discovery because they did not know how. They probably had never even seen the cooperative model in action before, and so when they saw it here, they did not recognize it. They may instead have mistaken it for weak or timid opposing counsel. It just provoked them to be more\n              <em>caveman</em>\n              like. They got more aggressive in the face of the unknown. They also ran away from any real discussion on technical issues. A classic case of the\n              <em>fight or flight</em>\n              instincts of a pre-computer-literate-lawyer faced with e-discovery.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel in this hypothetical did not trust the other side because they assumed they were like them. They were not competent enough to recognize or understand the new approach. They only understood \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93cooperation\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd from the outside, as just another tool, or keyword, in the game of hide-the-ball. They certainly had not read Professor Gensler\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s article and had no understanding at all on how the new cooperative, trans-negotiation model might help their clients. In Professor Genzler\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s words:\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">\n              The Cooperation Proclamation is exactly right when it urges lawyers to see cooperation as a means for advancing their clients\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 interests and not as a retreat from their duties as loyal advocates. As I have written elsewhere, the lawyers who default to battle mode in discovery \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c who fail even to consider whether cooperation might yield better results \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c are the ones who truly fail to serve their clients\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 interests.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <em>The Bull\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s-Eye View of Cooperation in Discovery</em>\n              , 10 Sedona Conf. J. 363, at 363 (2009 Supp.)\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              They had also not read the article by the Sedona Conference making the legal case for cooperation,\n              <em>The Case for Cooperation</em>\n              ,\n              <em>supra.</em>\n              The editor-in-chief of this article was well-known plaintiff\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s counsel, William P. Butterfield. The concluding paragraph of\n              <em>The Case for Cooperation </em>\n              succulently warns of what may happen to our system of justice if the new cooperative model to discovery is not adopted:\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">\n              If parties are expected to continue to manage discovery in the manner envisioned by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, cooperation will be necessary. Without such cooperation, discovery will become too expensive and time consuming for parties to effectively litigate their disputes.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <em>The Case for Cooperation</em>\n              ,\n              <em>Id.</em>\n              at 362.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel here did not even seem to understand what most truly competent plaintiff\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s counsel do, that every dollar spent on useless discovery is another dollar not available for settlement. The best, most competent counsel have always saved their powder for the real battles that count, on the law and application of the law to the facts. They have always understood that the true, and only valid purpose of discovery is to get at the key facts to allow reasoned evaluation of the case, not to prepare mountains of data, or extort the responding party, or bury the requesting party in a document dump. Competent legal counsel do not engage in\n              <em>discovery as abuse</em>\n              .\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Those that do soon develop a reputation that follows them into a court room, even if it is on the other side of the country of where they usually practice.\n              <em>See</em>\n              <em>Discovery As Abuse</em>\n              , 69 B.U. L. REV. 635 (1989). As the Sedona Conference noted, the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93risk of gaining a reputation among the judiciary as unduly combative during discovery, encourages cooperative behavior.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd\n              <em>The Case for Cooperation, supra </em>\n              at pg. 362.\n            </p>\n            <p>The only possible conclusion here is that Plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 were not competent to handle the e-discovery issues in this class-action employment case. For that reason alone, under this scenario they behaved unethically. They violated Rule 1.1.</p>\n            <p>\n              Many attorneys in this situation attempt to meet their ethical obligation of competence by hiring an e-discovery vendor to advise them. Unfortunately, this usually does not work, for such\n              <em>experts</em>\n              frequently only tell the attorneys who hired them what they want to hear. The\n              <em>hired guns </em>\n              simply supply arguments jazzed up with tech-speak to support the legal argument of the attorneys who hired them.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In any event, e-discovery vendors are technologists, not lawyers, and even when a rare e-discovery expert at a vendor does also have a law degree, they do not provide legal advice. They are not allowed to provide legal advice. The only way an attorney who is not competent in the law and practice of e-discovery can fulfill their ethical duty is by taking the time and considerable efforts needed to become competent, or by bringing in legal counsel who is competent to assist him or her. Vendors cannot do that. They cannot render legal advice, but I appear to be the only one pointing out that obvious fact.

In fact, the EDRM proposed vendor ethical code of conduct,\n              <em>Principle 4 \xe2\x80\x93 Sound Process</em>\n              , seems like it encourages vendors to provide legal advice: \xe2\x80\x9cService Providers should define, implement and audit documented sound processes that are designed to preserve legal defensibility.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a gray I know, but I strongly encourage the experts who are involved in this EDRM project to carefully consider the whole UPL issue and clarify draft Principle 4 and its comments on\n              <em>legal defensibility</em>\n              . By the way, except for my issue with Principle 4 and UPL, I am favorably impressed with the proposed\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.edrm.net/resources/mcoc" shape="rect">model e-discovery vendor ethics guidelines</a>\n              that EDRM has come up with and encourage all vendors to study it carefully.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <strong>Diligence.</strong>\n              Plaintiff\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s counsel here thought they were being diligent because they were engaging in what they saw as vigorous advocacy. Too bad they were playing the wrong game. True vigorous advocacy here would have entailed detailed examination of the reasons provided by defense counsel for the five custodians and seven issues. It would have required reciprocal disclosures on their part on their thinking and analysis of the importance of the various custodians to the case. Diligence would have required immediate study of the emails produced. It would have taken the dispute out of rhetoric and knee-jerk opposition to everything the other side proposes, and into the facts and legal analysis.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel in this scenario was not diligent at all. Their incompetence made that impossible. They thought they were being very diligent, and no doubt so did their clients, who are usually very easily impressed by the kind of saber-rattling in which they engaged. But in fact they did all of the wrong things.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 They engaged in knee-jerk opposition to everything the other side proposed, and this pretend diligence was really not diligent at all. Discovery as abuse is not an exercise in competent diligence. It is abuse, pure and simple.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <strong>\n                <img height="216" width="162" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/secretshh.jpg?w=162&amp;h=216" title="Secret Shh!" class="alignright wp-image-3777"></img>\n                Confidentiality.\n              </strong>\n              Plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel here thought they were being very ethical by refusing to disclose their work product. They would not give the defendant an idea on their thinking of the case, on what information they thought would be highly relevant. They would not disclose why they thought some custodians and issues were more important. That was their confidential thinking, and they thought they should keep it secret. They hoped to keep their analysis of the case (assume they had one, and this was not just a superficial form-driven lawsuit) to themselves. They wanted to surprise defendants as much as possible. Indeed, they were initially surprised by how much confidential information the defense counsel here provided, which, again, they mistakenly mistook as a sign of weakness and egged them on to keep demanding more and more. Then they were surprised again when defense counsel said no, and never budged from the initial 5/7. And finally were surprised again by the court ruling against them and went with the defense plan.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              So which attorneys in this scenario met their ethical duty under Rule 1.6 to \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93not reveal information relating to the representation of a client\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and which did not? Rule 1.6 has numerous exceptions to the duty of client confidentiality, including where the client gives informed consent or the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Here the disclosure by defense counsel was needed to carry out the representation and so impliedly authorized, even if not specifically authorized. Note that under the scenario no attorney-client privileged documents are disclosed, nor any privileged communications. Even client confidential documents are protected under a strong confidentiality order. Any non-relevant documents produced would also be covered by the confidentiality order and would be promptly returned. Further protection was provided by a strong clawback order.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The only confidential information disclosed here is\n              <em>some</em>\n              of the work-product privileged thinking and analysis of defense counsel. Unlike the attorney-client privilege, which is held by the client and can only be released by the client, the work-product privilege is held by the attorney, and released by the attorney. The disclosure of the attorney\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s work product was made here to advance their client\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s interests. It was made to facilitate efficient, cost-effective search and production, and later to obtain a protective order preventing unduly burdensome, disproportionate e-discovery.

Plaintiff does not dispute this statement and concedes that these documents qualify as attorney work product. However, Plaintiff contends that the SEC has waived any work product privilege with respect to these documents because similar handwritten notes were disclosed to Plaintiff during the criminal prosecution of Mr. Forbes. According to the declaration of Christopher R. Hart, an attorney at Williams &amp; Connolly LLP, at least eleven of the documents of handwritten notes identified in the Vaughn index were produced by the government during the Forbes matter. Plaintiff thus contends that the government has \xe2\x80\x9cwaived the work product privilege as to entire subject matter of handwritten notes between SEC staff and Corigliano, Kearney, or their respective counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">\n              As with the attorney-client privilege, a party may waive the work product privilege through disclosure.\n              <em>See In re United Mine Workers of Am.

I must conclude that plaintiffs stonewalling actions in this case are also consistent with Rule 1.6. Although their behavior in this hypothetical was unethical under the other rules here considered, it was not under Rule 1.6. They have the right to keep all of their work product to themselves, even though it was stupid to do so, and thus a probable violation of Rule 1.1 on competence, but it is was\n              <em>their</em>\n              work-product. Of course, no rule should be considered in isolation, and work-product thinking is required to be disclosed under many rules of civil procedures, including especially Rule 26(f), and any time you are seeking relief from the court, or making final preparation for trial, not to mention trial itself.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img height="210" width="315" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/legaltech_losey_ball.png?w=315&amp;h=210" title="Legaltech: Losey v Ball" class="alignright wp-image-16993"></img>\n              In the same professorial discussion group my esteemed LegalTech debating adversary, Professor Craig Ball, had this to say concerning the policy behind limited work product disclosures, starting with a comment on pre-digital paper productions:\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">\n              You may argue that we never got to look behind a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s decisions to produce or withhold even if the lawyer made the selections by throwing documents down the stairs and producing only what hit the next landing. But perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s not an approach we want to replicate in post-digital practice. We indulged ourselves in the belief that, right or wrong, relevance and privilege determinations were a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s to make and largely immune from being second-guessed absent evidence of gross dereliction or misconduct. But, as we move into the realm of search technology\xe2\x80\x93and especially those like keyword search only lately appreciated to be deeply flawed\xe2\x80\x93the tools and methods employed must be closely examined and tested, including by exposing them to adversarial challenge.\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">\n              Perhaps we need to step away from our reflexive \xe2\x80\x9cwe are lawyers and we are special,\xe2\x80\x9d in order to consider what approaches are calculated to best serve the ends of justice. Cooperation demands communication. If you believe the first is more than a pipe dream, you need to embrace the latter.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I have to agree with Craig on this one. Opposing counsel need to talk with each other and explain what they are doing in the area of search and production. You do not have to give up all your trade secrets, nor reveal all of your strategies, but you have to be prepared to disclose enough to show your reasonable, good faith efforts. What does cooperation look like? It looks like lawyers talking and making mutual disclosures needed to plan discovery in a case.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <strong>Expediting Litigation.</strong>\n              The conduct of plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel here violated their duty to expedite litigation. They did so in spite of the fact that expedited litigation is almost always consistent with a plaintiff\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s interest in a civil proceeding for a speedy trial. Plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel here unethically violated this duty to expedite by forcing unnecessary motion practice. Further, the closed approach of plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel to try to conceal the facts they really wanted in discovery probably also violated Rule 3.2, even of it did not violate Rule 1.6.\n              <em>See eg.</em>\n              <em>DeGeer v. Gillis</em>\n              , 755 F. Supp. 2d 909, 930 (N.D. Ill. 2010) (if parties had participated in \xe2\x80\x9ccandid, meaningful discussion of ESI at the outset of the case,\xe2\x80\x9d expensive and time consuming discovery and motions practice could have been avoided).\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <strong>\n                <img height="199" width="210" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fingers_crossed.jpg?w=210&amp;h=199" title="Fingers_Crossed" class="alignright wp-image-16719"></img>\n                Candor Toward the Tribunal.\n              </strong>\n              I think the conduct of plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel in this hypothetical violated this fundamental Rule of Professional Conduct too, but admit their violation might be seen as technical, and is certainly the kind of conduct that goes on every day and is tolerated by both Bench and Bar. Plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel here did not \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93\n              <em>make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0 or, offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false</em>\n              .\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd But they did not provide the whole truth either. They made a demand in their motion to compel for 30 custodians and 30 issues, and they continued in this demand at the hearing before the tribunal. Let us assume that they also made oral representations to the judge at a hearing that they thought this 30/30 demand was necessary and appropriate under the facts of the case and governing law. But that is at best a half-truth because they have been willing all along to accept 20/20.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For that reason they did not display the kind of candor to the tribunal that I personally think is appropriate. Instead, they continued to play the only game they knew how, the\n              <em>negotiation game</em>\n              , and they treated the judge as just another player in the game. In a negotiation game, you are never completely candid. That would defeat the whole point of the game. If plaintiff\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s counsel here were in fact candid to the tribunal, they would admit that 20/20 is their goal, but then again, that could be a slippery slope for them. It could also lead to admission of their basic incompetence to do e-discovery to begin with, to engage in meaningful discussion and analysis, much less to enter into a true cooperative dialogue with the other side.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <strong>\n                <img alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/beavis-and-butt-head-fighting.jpg?w=450" title="beavis-and-butt-head-fighting" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7761"></img>\n                Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel.\n              </strong>\n              Some attorneys are surprised when they see the terms of this important Rule of Professional Conduct.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Candor to the tribunal is one thing, but fairness to the opposing party and their attorneys? That is simply not part of the culture of many lawyers and law firms! They seem surprised when they are reminded that the requirement is built into our rules of ethics. It is not a mere professional courtesy, as some think, it is an ethical imperative. Under Rule 3.4 a lawyer shall not \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93\n              <em>unlawfully obstruct another party\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s access to evidence</em>\n              .\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd A lawyer shall not \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93\n              <em>conceal a document or other material that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is relevant to a pending or a reasonably foreseeable proceeding; nor counsel or assist another person to do any such act</em>\n              .\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd A lawyer shall not in \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93\n              <em>make a frivolous discovery request or fail to make reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party</em>\n              .\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The attorneys for the party responding to the discovery request in this hypothetical, defense counsel, complied with their ethical duties. My conclusion assumes that they sought to limit discovery for the grounds stated, burdensomeness and likely relevance. I assume they did not have any bad faith ulterior motives, such as an attempt to conceal evidence that they knew to be unfavorable to their client. I assume they were not just trying to obstruct access to evidence or conceal relevant ESI. Finally, I assume that their search and production efforts were reasonably diligent.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              With these assumptions I conclude defense counsel acted ethically because their refusal to review and produce any more that five custodians and seven issues in the first round of phased discovery did not prevent disclosure of any evidence they knew to be relevant, and did not prevent plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 later discovery from other custodians or issues that might prove necessary. It might\n              <em>delay</em>\n              it to a second phase, but not\n              <em>prevent</em>\n              it. If defense counsel should uncover a document outside of this scope, one that is obviously relevant, then under this rule they would be required to disclose such a document and should not conceal it.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I conclude to the contrary that under the given facts plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel violated the duty of fairness to opposing counsel because their initial request for discovery was frivolous. They signed and served a discovery request for 50 custodians and 50 issues, knowing that was excessive, and for that reason quickly dropping to 30/30, and ready to accept 20/20, which is what they really thought was reasonable all along. They used a request for production as a mere negotiation tool, and in so doing made an unethically frivolous discovery request. Note they also violated Rule 26(g) FRCP, which Judge Grimm in\n              <em>Mancia</em>\n              said was the most misunderstood and under utilized of all rules of procedure. Rule 26(g) is similar to Rule 11, but applies only to the discovery pleadings.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Rule 26(g)(1)(B) states that a signature on a discovery request constitutes an attorney\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s certification that the request is:\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">(ii) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0</p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">(iii) neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.</p>\n            <p>\n              They thought 20 custodians and 20 issues was proportional, yet they signed a request for production seeking 50. They did so for purposes of setting up a negotiation. This is, I suggest, an improper purpose under 26(g)(1)(B)(ii). They knew 50 was unreasonable and unduly burdensome, yet they still signed the discovery request. Plaintiffs counsel in this hypothetical thereby intentionally violated 26(g)(1)(B)(iii) triggering a mandatory obligation under the rule for the court to impose sanctions.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This conduct by the requesting party was not only a civil rule violation, it was unethical. It violated Professional Rule of Conduct 34(c) by \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal,\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd namely Rule 26(g)(1)(B) and as explained before, violated ethics Rule \xc3\x82\xc2\xa034(d) because it was frivolous.\n            </p>\n            <p align="center">\n              <strong>Conclusion</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img height="225" width="300" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/hieronymous_bosch_hell.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" title="Hieronymous Bosch and his famous depiction of one corner in HELL" class="size-medium wp-image-16966 alignright"></img>\n              Some may say my hypothetical is far-fetched, that attorneys do not engage in this type of behavior.

This ethics rule, like the 26(g) procedure rule, is a paper tiger. Indeed, you could say that about all of the ethics rules here discussed in the context of e-discovery.

The ones we have are sufficient to guide us, but we need to take the time and effort to study and understand these rules. We need to discuss these rules and how they apply to the new situations presented in e-discovery practice. It is my hope that this early effort in that direction will stimulate more discussion and analysis of the subject.\n            </p>\n            <div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy

wp-image-1454"></img>\n              I have been interested in the ethical issues surrounding electronic discovery since 2006. At that time I phased out my general trial practice, went full-time e-discovery, joined The Sedona Conference\xc3\x82\xc2\xae, and started this\n              <em>e-Discovery Team</em>\n              \xc3\x82\xc2\xae blog. As part of my practice I read most of the opinions around the country written on e-discovery. I quickly noticed something I had not seen before in any other field of law. The case law is dominated by sanctions cases involving spoliation of evidence. Not only that, attorneys are often directly implicated in this spoliation and accused of many other types of intentional or negligent misconduct. I began to wonder if I had stepped into a crazy zone of the law where all attorneys acted like sharks.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This suspicion me to think, write, and speak often on the subject of e-discovery ethics, which culminated in my article,\n              <em>\n                <a href="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/lawyers-behaving-badly.pdf" shape="rect">Lawyers Behaving Badly</a>\n                : Understanding Unprofessional Conduct in e-Discovery,\n              </em>\n              60 Mercer L. Rev. 983 (Spring 2009). The article led to my participation in a full day academic seminar on the subject at Mercer Law School with noted e-discovery experts, Judge John Facciola, Judge David Baker, Jason R. Baron, William Hamilton, and Professor Monroe Freedman, and Chilton Varner, the transcript for which is published at 60 Mercer L. Rev. 863 (Spring 2009). I came to understand that I had not wandered into a special zone of hell, and that lawyers doing e-discovery were no worse, or no better, than other lawyers. But they were put to special challenges and conditions unique to this new field of law, and the end result was many more errors in judgment than you can find anywhere else. These errors continue as shown by surveys of case law.\n              <em>See eg.</em>\n              Willoughby, Jones, Antine,\n              <em> </em>\n              <em>Sanctions for E-Discovery Violations: By the Numbers</em>\n              <em>, 60 Duke L.J. 789 (2010).</em>\n            </p>\n            <p align="center">\n              <em>\n                <strong>\n                  Lawyers Behaving Badly\n                  <br clear="none"></br>\n                </strong>\n              </em>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <em>In my 2009 law review article, </em>\n              <em>Lawyers Behaving Badly, </em>\n              <em>I concluded that:</em>\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">\n              <em>[T]he profession has not suddenly become more sinister than before. Although, some suggest that the dominance of large firms as mega-business enterprises is causing a significant decline in overall ethics. </em>\n              <em>See</em>\n              <em> Marc Galanter &amp; William Henderson, </em>\n              <em>The Elastic Tournament: A Second Transformation of the Big Law Firm</em>\n              <em>, 60 STAN. L. REV. 1867 (2008).

Instead, I hypothesized four reasons to explain the apparent frequent bad behavior of so many attorneys in the field of electronic discovery:\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">There are four fundamental forces at work in e-discovery, which when considered together, explain most attorney misconduct:</p>\n            <p style="padding-left:90px;">(1) a general lack of technological sophistication,</p>\n            <p style="padding-left:90px;">(2) over-zealous attorney conduct,</p>\n            <p style="padding-left:90px;">(3) a lack of development of professional duties as an advocate, and</p>\n            <p style="padding-left:90px;">(4) legal incompetence.</p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">These \xe2\x80\x9dWicked Quadrants\xe2\x80\x9d are depicted in the circular diagram below.</p>\n            <p>\n              <img height="300" width="278" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/wicked-quadrant.png?w=278&amp;h=300" title="Wicked Quadrant" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16889"></img>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I am not going to explore the ins and outs of the\n              <em>Wicked Quadrant</em>\n              in this essay, nor rehash the reasons so many lawyers fall astray in e-discovery. (Interested readers are directed to the article and symposium transcript)\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Instead, I am going to review and briefly analyze the primary Rules of Professional Conduct that are implicated in e-discovery ethics. These are the rules that we should understand and rely upon to keep us on the\n              <em>straight and narrow</em>\n              , and out of the sanctions penalty box. At the end of Part One I will present a common hypothetical where the ethics of many lawyers involved in e-discovery productions are severely tested . In Part Two I will analyze the hypothetical and show how these rules of Professional Conduct should apply.\n            </p>\n            <p align="center">\n              <strong>ABA\xe2\x80\x99s Model Rules of Professional Conduct</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The ethical codes require all lawyers to be competent, and, if faced with a legal task wherein they are not competent, such as e-discovery, to bring in other attorneys who are.\n              <strong>Rule 1.1</strong>\n              :\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</p>\n            <p>\n              Our ethics also requires diligence, a task that is impossible unless you are competent and actually know what to do and when to do it.\n              <strong>Rule 1.3</strong>\n              :\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</p>\n            <p>\n              Fast and efficient action is built into our code. It is emphasized again by\n              <strong>Rule 3.2</strong>\n              that requires lawyers to expedite litigation:\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.</p>\n            <p>\n              The duty of confidentiality is also a core value that often comes into play in e-discovery practice. It is embodied in\n              <strong>Rule 1.6</strong>\n              :\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation or the disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).</p>\n            <p>\n              Our fundamental values embodied by our Rules of Professional Conduct also require candor towards the tribunal, the judges. Candor means openness and complete honesty. It is a core value that may never be broken under any circumstances. Should it violate your duty of loyalty to your client, you are required to withdraw from representation, rather than ever be dishonest and closed to the presiding judge. Here are the exact words of this most important of rules,\n              <strong>Rule 3.3</strong>\n              :\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:</p>\n            <p style="padding-left:90px;">(1) make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer; . . .</p>\n            <p style="padding-left:90px;">(3) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. . . .\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd</p>\n            <p>\n              Our core values as lawyers also require fairness to the opposing party in litigation and fairness to the opposing counsel. This means, among other things, that games of hide-the-ball are forbidden. This does not mean that you should provide evidence harmful to your client that was not requested, or not relevant, or that you are not legally required to produce such as privileged information.

On the other hand, the reputation gains and societal values from fulfillment of professional duties are more long term and abstract. In the hope that a picture actually may be worth a thousand words, and so spare you unnecessary reading at this time, I provide these diagrams below.

Another element of complexity must be added to get a better understanding of the problem.

There is more to this picture than simple economics. The law, after all, attracts many who are concerned with justice and care about doing the right thing. Most lawyers have strong moral fiber and need little encouragement to do the right thing. They are more than\n              <em>pen-and-quill mercenaries</em>\n              . Integrity, professional pride, and competence temper their financial motivations. Moreover, some enlightened clients recognize and financially reward professional competence and are influenced by professional reputation in the lawyer selection and compensation processes.\n            </p>\n            <p align="center">\n              <strong>Cooperation</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The strategy demanded in e-discovery when it is performed competently, is fundamentally different than traditional adversarial strategy for courtroom arguments. It involves\n              <em>cooperation</em>\n              on discovery, buttressed by liberal disclosure by both sides (party requesting information, and party responding to the discovery requests). The need for this new strategy, and the name given therefore of\n              <em>cooperation</em>\n              , was initiated by Richard Braman, the founder of the Sedona Conference. Richard set forth this Sedona initiative in a press conference followed by a written, online\n              <em>Sedona Conference Cooperation Proclamation</em>\n              (2008). This is a brief document of only two and a half pages. It is well summarized by its conclusion, which states:\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">\n              It is time to build upon modern Rules amendments, state and federal, which address e-discovery.

J. 339 (2009 Supp.) The article was written by a group of Sedona contributors led by Bill Butterfield of Hausfeld LLP.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 The executive editors were Richard G. Braman and Kenneth J. Withers, both of The Sedona Conference\xc3\x82\xc2\xae.

The competence weakness in turn limits the restraints on unethical conduct.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 The hardest ethical decisions have to be made where you are not sure what to do. As practitioners of e-discovery improve their technical competence, they realize that the cooperative model must be employed to focus on the issues and to control costs. I have yet to meet an experienced attorney in this field who does not agree with this proposition, one who knows both discovery and trial Practice.\n            </p>\n            <p align="center">\n              <strong>Hypothetical</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Let us assume for purposes of this hypothetical that the attorneys for one side, the defendant employer in a class action case, have shifted to the new paradigm of Cooperation, and the attorneys for the other side, here the plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel, have not. This means plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel are still stuck in the old school attitude of attacking all of the other side\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s proposals without first considering their merits, without any objective analysis of reasonability.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              They do this because they assume that if the other side wants something, then it must be bad for their side. They assume that any proposal is not genuine, that it is instead a gross-exaggeration of the other side\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s real position. They assume\n              <em>anti-Solomon</em>\n              attitudes where the baby will be split. For that reason they say 1,000 is their bottom line, whereas in fact the reasonable number, which they well know, is 10 not 1,000. They begin at 1,000 even though they know that 10 is proportional. They do not cooperate. They negotiate. They want to win, and most will do so at all costs without regard to the unnecessary attorney fees thereby incurred.\n              <img height="189" width="300" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/shark-lawyers.gif?w=300&amp;h=189" title="shark lawyers" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7186"></img>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Unfortunately, in e-discovery most attorneys are still stuck in the non-cooperative win/lose discovery battle. They mistakenly think that it is their job to not only argue the law and application of the law to the given facts, but also to try to change the given facts, to hide and obfuscate facts they think are adverse to their client.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This fundamental difference in attitude towards discovery makes the position of the\n              <em>cooperator</em>\n              , here defense counsel, very difficult. The solution is largely one of education of opposing counsel, or failing that, the court.\n            </p>\n            <p>An objective reasonable discussion should resolve all issues, especially if there is a fair measure of transparency to the process. This must remain the goal of all cooperative counsel in order to protect their clients from excessive costs and disputes.</p>\n            <p>\n              Next assume that plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel makes a very broad demand for production of email using the old school, win-lose negotiation methods. Assume they make demand for the relevant emails from 50 custodians, naming everyone and their uncle that might possibly have anything to do with the dispute in question. They also purport to define relevancy very broadly by making 50 category demands on a wide variety of subjects, many with only a nebulous connection to the factual issues of the case. They do so knowing that at most 10 custodians are likely to really know anything, but they are not sure exactly who they are, and for that reason they name the larger group of 50. They are also not sure of the real issues of fact in the case yet, largely because they have never talked with opposing counsel. Since they do not have a clear idea of the issues in the case, they define relevancy very broadly with 50 categories of documents.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The new paradigm attorneys, here defense counsel, quickly realize when they attempt real communication with plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel on issues of e-discovery, that they are dealing with old school negotiators. It quickly becomes obvious to experienced e-discovery counsel when opposing counsel has little or no personal competence in the area. You cannot hide that, no matter how many experts you may hire to guide you.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Defense counsel quickly realized that no true communications were likely, that they were engaged in a traditional negotiation process with Plaintiff\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s counsel. But rather than accept and play the game by say offering 3 custodians and 5 issues, hoping to settle for 5 and 7, defense counsel lays out their case for five custodians and seven issues. They play a new game, a cooperative game of reasoned discussion and informed decisions. Defense counsel makes disclosure and explains why they consider the 5/7 offer to be reasonable. They explain why they think the offer that would be beneficial to all parties.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:left;" align="center">\n              <img height="166" width="210" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/sharks-lasers.jpg?w=210&amp;h=166" title="sharks.lasers" class="alignright wp-image-16935"></img>\n              Next assume that plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel are unpersuaded by defense counsel, that they respond with little or no substance, and instead demand 30/30, instead of 50/50, arguing that they have now made major concessions, and thus suggesting or signaling that they will accept 20 custodians and 20 issues. They assume, incorrectly, that defense counsel is like them, that the 5/7 proposal was just the opening offer in a negotiation dance. They did not really care about the reasons stated by defendants for the proposal, and, truth be told, they did not really understand most of the e-discovery technical talk surrounding the issues. They were hardball trial lawyers; tough advocates doing their job by pounding out as much information from the other side as they could. They thought it would help their clients to make the defendant\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s case as expensive as possible. They knew e-discovery was a good way to do that, and knew from past experience that this\n              <em>oppose everything</em>\n              tactic was a good way to drive up the settlement value of the case. Discovery, especially e-discovery, was just another tool in the battle against the other side.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Next assume defendants continue to refuse to play the negotiation game, and hearing no real\n              <em>reasons</em>\n              for them to think their original calculation of 5 custodians and 7 issues is wrong, press forwards in their demands for 5/7. They ask for reasons and calm discussion from plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel, but instead receive rhetoric and negotiation bluster. Accusatory letters are exchanged, the real purpose of which are not true communications, but mere posturing, mere creation of exhibits for use in motion practice.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The court is then asked to consider cross-motions for relief on a variety of complex e-discovery issues. Both sides claim that they are the true cooperator, and that the opposing party, not them, is to blame for the impasse. What should a judge then do? How do you tell the true cooperator from the mere poser? Both sides claim to be cooperators, and one side did make a major move in custodian and issue count, whereas the other did not. From the negotiation perspective, it looks like plaintiff\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s counsel is being more cooperative. Whereas we know that they are not cooperating at all, they are not even communicating or attempting to narrow the issues. How is a savvy judge to sort things out?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The answer lies in probing the merits of the dispute. This requires the judge to also break out of the old negotiation paradigm, to look beyond the facial numbers. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Why are five custodians reasonable and proportional, and twenty custodians too much? Why should relevancy be defined by seven issues, and not twenty? It is not a mere numbers game, as plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel in this scenario would suggest. The court must do the hard work of examining the merits of the dispute, of determining what is reasonable and proportional for the case, and what is not. The court should refuse to buy into the old paradigm negotiation model, and just split the difference and enter an order allowing 12 custodians and 14 issues. The judge should instead examine the facts in an objective manner, and if 5 custodians and 7 issues are indeed reasonable, should rule accordingly.\n            </p>\n            <p>This takes time and hard work on the judge\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s part, and on part of the attorneys who frame the issues and present the case. They need to provide meat for the bone. They need to make disclosures and present facts to support their positions.</p>\n            <p>\n              In the hypothetical let us further assume that defense counsel realized their quandary and voluntarily made substantial disclosures. Assume they disclosed their own mental impressions, their work product as to why the five custodians they picked would have the most relevant email. Assume they also provided total counts and other metrics of email for the five custodians they proposed. Moreover, assume the defendant also provided counts for the additional fifteen custodians that plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 proposed.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Assume the defendant make even further disclosures to support their argument of reasonability and proportionality. Assume they presented detailed information concerning the costs of the review and production proposed by plaintiffs, as compared to their proposal. Assume it was not puffed or inflated and was supported by facts, which they offered to backup with further testimony if needed.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Assume defendants went even further and began to make sample productions from the top five custodians they picked, and that they did so after a strong confidentiality and clawback order was entered by the court. Assume the emails produced showed that most of the other fifteen custodians that plaintiffs wanted to add at great additional cost were copied on most of the relevant documents.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Assume defense counsel even made some random sample productions from all twenty custodians to show that the top five they had selected had the vast majority of the relevant documents, and were the only source of the few highly relevant documents found. Assume they not only produced the documents they marked relevant, but also made a selective disclosure of documents they marked irrelevant to provide the plaintiffs with an opportunity to review and if need be, to challenge their understanding of relevancy in this case.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Assume that defense counsel was also proposing phased production. That they only insisted their 5/7 approach be for the first phase, and that they did not insist plaintiffs waive their rights to seek additional document productions in follow-up phases. Instead, assume the defendants only sought to clarify that they reserved their rights to object to any future discovery, or not, depending on the circumstances.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              With all of these additional facts, these voluntary disclosures, the judge\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s work becomes much easier. The judge now has the information, the facts, on which to make a ruling. The defendant has made significant disclosures of their client\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s email systems, and even of their email contents. Now the judge is in a position to determine whose position is reasonable, and who is the true cooperator here. This information provides the substance needed for the judge to go beyond the negotiation model of discovery dispute resolution to a true judicial model.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img height="154" width="154" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/sharks-lasers-2.gif?w=154&amp;h=154" title="sharks.lasers.2" class="alignright wp-image-16936"></img>\n              Of course, in the real world all lawyers come before judges with a history. They have a reputation. This can also help a judge to evaluate \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s on first\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and know who is a poser, and who is not. This is especially true where a judge has seen and heard from one or more of the lawyers several times before. That is where the intangible value of an attorney\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s reputation comes in.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I am happy to say that in my experience when most judges are faced with this situation, and properly advised of the issues, they will do the hard work and make their own determination of reasonability. They will not simply split the baby and order 12 custodians and 14 issues. But this requires proper education of judges on the issues, which in turn requires competent counsel with a good reputation for truth, honesty and fair dealing. If defense counsel in this scenario are competent, and so is the judge, a just and reasoned result will usually be attained, regardless of any overly-clever negotiation tactics of plaintiffs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 counsel.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <strong>END OF PART ONE.</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>In Part Two I will analyze

wp-image-4537"></img>\n              There can be no real justice without truth, and in today\xe2\x80\x99s world of civil litigation, no real truth without e-discovery. That is because writings are the key evidence in most cases and almost all writings today are electronic. The paper documents we see are mere shadows of the original ESI; small tips of vast icebergs of electronic truth. Yet lawyers continue to settle for the few paper remnants scattered about a controversy and avoid search of these depths. This realm is beyond their training, beyond their competence. So they agree between themselves not to go there, or if forced, they delegate the task to vendors. They abdicate the traditional role of lawyer as master of discovery. This is a disservice to the profession and the clients we serve.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This situation is getting worse each day, not better, as ESI grows exponentially in volume and complexity. It has created a crises for the legal profession. It is not a crises of poor rules as some contend, and thus revising the rules again is no solution. It is a crises of competence, and as such it is an ethical crises. It is time we owned up to the problem and did something about it. We have an ethical duty to act. The solution is clear. Education and training, combined with recognition and affiliation of experts where competence has not been attained.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Fundamental to professional ethics is the duty to keep the dispute resolution process fair and honest. Controversies must be settled on their merits based on the facts and the law. Moreover, lawyers must put the interest of their clients ahead of their own personal interests. These are the two core truths of attorney ethics. In electronic discovery, we are failing on both fronts.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Can a lawsuit be fair if only one side has an attorney competent to explore the electronic depths, to uncover the truth of what happened? Is the process fair if the attorneys on both sides lack the competence to find the facts hidden in the electronic writings? If the attorneys agree not to look behind the paper curtain and try a case without knowing the electronic truths, is that a fair trial for anyone? If e-discovery in a case is too arcane and complex for an attorney to handle, do they have a duty to share the burden of representation with another attorney who is competent in this field?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Attorneys must put aside their personal pecuniary interest and act in the best interests of the client. If they are not yet competent in e-discovery, or if they have limited competence and face a problem beyond their means, they must retain co-counsel who is able, rather than avoid it or do it negligently. They have an ethical duty to do so, even though this will lower their fees or prove embarrassing to their false pride. The interests of the client must always come first.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In the medical profession, no physician, barring an extreme emergency, would dream of attempting a procedure for which they were not trained and not competent. They would of course affiliate another physician in their patient\xe2\x80\x99s care who had the expertise needed. They would not just retain a vendor, say a drug company, to tell them what to do. They would enlist the assistance of a peer, of another professional subject to the same duties of ethics and professionalism, not to mention malpractice insurance. Is the legal profession subject to a lower standard? I think not. It is time we started living up to it.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Society is complicated. Law and dispute resolution are in many cases today, if not most cases, nearly as complex as the problems faced by medicine. Specialists are needed in substantive areas of law and in procedural areas. The day has come for e-discovery to be recognized as its own speciality. This does not mean that all e-discovery tasks are beyond the pale of trial attorneys. The modern litigation generalist can, with sufficient time and attention, learn the fundamentals of e-discovery and handle many of the basic tasks on their own, including management of vendors.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Still, most have not yet done so. It takes more than a couple of CLEs and books. Until litigators get there, they have an ethical duty to enlist the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0assistance\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0of other attorneys who have. Moreover, in large more complex cases, an e-discovery specialist attorney will always be needed to manage and supervise the process and personally handle the most difficult tasks. The facts and issues can be too complex and time consuming to be performed competently by part-time e-discovery\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0practitioners.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>ESI Bytes Interview</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img alt="Karl Schieneman" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/karl-schieneman.jpg?w=450" title="Karl Schieneman" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4536"></img>\n              Since ethics and e-discovery are, in my view, critical topics for all litigators today, when I was contacted by\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Karl Schieneman (shown left) for another interview, I agreed, but only if we would limit the discussion to ethics.

People believe it.</p>\n            <p>RALPH: Well, yeah \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c no, I would love to see another area of law that has more problems than we do in e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it.</p>\n            <p>KARL: I won\xe2\x80\x99t challenge you on it, but why do you think this is growing? Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t disagree, honestly, but why do you think this area is growing with ethical issues?</p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: Well, this was the puzzler. &lt;\n              <em>Hope he gives me time because this is going to take a while to answer properly</em>\n              .&gt; And so I started thinking about it, you know, and this is a big problem and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that just happens overnight. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0And then I got an invitation from the Dean at Mercer Law School, who said they were organizing this event and \xe2\x80\xa6 we came up with a dream team, several of them were available, including Judge Facciola, Jason R. Baron, and the person that I now co\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98teach e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery with at the University of Florida Law School, and that is Bill Hamilton.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 He came up there.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 And then we got Judge David Baker, who\xe2\x80\x99s a Magistrate Judge in Orlando, well known and rightfully so for his writing of the e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery opinion,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n              <em>In Re Seroquel. </em>\n              Judge Baker is the only person I know who\xe2\x80\x99s been messing with computers longer than I have.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 He goes back to the early and mid \xe2\x80\x9970s, so he\xe2\x80\x99s very much of a technophile.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              We had this kind of dream team of people that were all \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c you know, we had months to prepare for this event and trying to think out the whole question of ethics.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Jason gave a presentation \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c the way it works is in an academic setting, you make a presentation and then the panel members sort of comment on it. Jason made a very interesting presentation concerning ethics related to search, as you might expect, and it had to do with asymmetric knowledge is the way he called it. In other words, when you represent a client as a lawyer over and over again or if you\xe2\x80\x99re in\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98house counsel, you become very familiar with their information and you know basically \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c you have a much better idea of what\xe2\x80\x99s in their information, certainly far better than opposing counsel does. What kind of ethical duties does that create to assist opposing counsel in their search for relevant information? This was the thesis that Jason explored and that was followed up upon by Judge Facciola in a whole area of discussion.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              My area of discussion, though, got back to this puzzling question: why are lawyers behaving badly? &lt;\n              <em>That is supposed to be funny Karl. How about at least a chuckle? Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s never heard of the show?</em>\n              &gt; Kind of a take-off on the popular television show. &lt;\n              <em>Still no laughs. Oh well. Maybe </em>\n              <em>he\xe2\x80\x99s texting or something</em>\n              ?&gt; I came up with this thing that I called the\n              <em>wicked quadrant</em>\n              , which is four different factors that I believe explain why it is that all of a sudden there\xe2\x80\x99s so many lawyers being sanctioned in the field of e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery. So I gave a presentation on that.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In the meantime, I also wrote a law review article further elaborating on my thoughts, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be published by the Mercer Law Review, coming out soon in their next 2009 edition.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 The other thing Mercer did, which is fascinating and I suggest you try and get a hold of this, they made a transcript of the entire proceeding. So you can read Judge Facciola\xe2\x80\x99s speech on this, you can read what Jason had to say about the duty to assist opposing counsel.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 You can read what I had to say and everybody, including \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c by the way, the keynote speaker, who was none of us.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Professor Freedman and Metadata</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img alt="Professor Monroe Freedman" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/monroe-freedman.jpg?w=450" title="Professor Monroe Freedman" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4543"></img>\n              The keynote speech was given by a legend in academic circles called Professor Monroe Freedman, and he is about \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c late 70s.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Very vigorous &lt;\n              <em>Tried to beak my hand when he shook it.</em>\n              &gt; and known for his controversiality.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 He spoke about\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0the ethics of metadata. He thinks that you have a duty to try and find out what your opposing counsel\xe2\x80\x99s metadata is in emails and correspondence they send you.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 In spite of the fact that many state bar associations say it\xe2\x80\x99s unethical, Professor Freedman takes the controversial view that you have a duty to mine metadata.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s also in the transcript.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 A very fascinating discussion about that.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 In fact I got into a big argument with Professor Freedman about that as I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s proper to do when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about correspondence between lawyers.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 But he has a strong position, saying that it is in fact a duty to your client to try and do that.\n            </p>\n            <p>KARL: Is Professor Freedman an attorney as well or just an academic?</p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: Oh, boy, they hate it when you say\n              <em>just an academic. </em>\n              &lt;\n              <em>Karl, you can now kiss\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0any possible academic career goodbye!</em>\n              &gt;\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Yeah, he is an attorney \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c as a matter of fact he represents lawyers that get in trouble with bar associations. And he\xe2\x80\x99s written several textbooks on the ethics of law and is a guy that you might retain if you had a problem ethically in front of a state board. So yeah, he does practice law, but very controversial. One appeals court judge \xe2\x80\xa6 who later became a supreme court justice \xe2\x80\xa6 was on a campaign to have Professor Monroe Freedman disbarred because he was controversial back in the \xe2\x80\x9960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s. He survived. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite entertaining to read what he had to say.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 So look out for that, the Mercer Law Review with the full transcript.\n            </p>\n            <p>KARL: Okay.</p>\n            <p>RALPH I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably blog about that or Twitter about it or something to let people know because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to hear this kind of discussion.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Believe me, no punches were pulled.</p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>The Wicked Quadrant</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img alt="Wicked Quadrant" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/wicked-quadrant.png?w=450" title="Wicked Quadrant" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4544"></img>\n              So anyway, I wrote this law review article called\n              <em>The Wicked Quadrant</em>\n              that will also be included in the publication, and you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m honored to be in there with Judge Facciola and Professor Freedman and Jason and all of them. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into the details, but I will just tell you what the four elements of the quadrant are. \xe2\x80\xa6 I find there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of resonance and understanding among the general bar, nonspecialists in e-discovery, concerning ethics.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 They get ethics and understand the duty of legal competence. They know that\xe2\x80\x99s the fundamental challenge that we\xe2\x80\x99re facing here.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              One of the four sections of the quadrant is that we all have a duty to keep up.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 We have a duty to learn the new law and like it or not, part of that is \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c in litigation \xe2\x80\x93 e-discovery.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take the time to train ourselves to be competent in this field.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0The fact that the bar as a whole is not really doing that is one of the problems and leads to this appearance of impropriety.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 A lot of the impropriety is from not knowing what they were doing, and they were making mistakes.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 It may look like intentional bad faith, but actually they\xe2\x80\x99re just screwing up because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              KARL: Yeah, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that in law.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you think back to when you started as a lawyer, this is where \xe2\x80\x94 when I was reading this was my \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c what I first thought about.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 I remember that first year summer associate at a downtown law firm being asked to research something.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 And it was almost as if everything I learned in legal writing disappeared from my mind.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 I walked into the library and I thought, what do I do?\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 And I must have killed a lot of time.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to tell anyone I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to start it.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 And, you know, I got \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c got through the project but \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c but it was \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c it\xe2\x80\x99s almost like you\xe2\x80\x99re not rewarded or there\xe2\x80\x99s this fear of saying I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand this, you know, when it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time you try something.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 And that \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s the way lawyers are rewarded.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve often heard partner, making partner, is a lot about never screwing up.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to interrupt you.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH. &lt;\n              <em>Huh? </em>\n              <em>What was that all about.</em>\n              &gt; No, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c you know, when I got out of law school, the UCC had just been enacted a couple years before. None of the older lawyers knew the UCC and it was a tremendous opportunity for young lawyers to make a contribution immediately. That\xe2\x80\x99s the same situation we\xe2\x80\x99re in now. When you and I did the show before it was on education, so you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me talk about this before. Young lawyers just getting out of law school now or just starting practice, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous opportunity for you if you can get the competence necessary because a lot of the older attorneys \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c the ones that are my age \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c they\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to take the time and it\xe2\x80\x99s just inherently difficult for them.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I started thinking about it and it is more than just a question of legal competence; it\xe2\x80\x99s also a question of technology competence. That is a key part of the quadrant, the four factors to understand why lawyers are screwing up and behaving badly, is because they\xe2\x80\x99re just overwhelmed by the technology. Most lawyers don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand Facebook, they don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand how email works, how deletion works, they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what double-deletion means. There\xe2\x80\x99s just a lot of things that are confusing to them. This technology incompetence leads them to do dumb things in cases like say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99ll review that back-up tape and produce the relevant emails to you next week, Your Honor\xe2\x80\x9d when of course they have no clue that there\xe2\x80\x99s 10 million emails on that back-up tape. They just \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c they don\xe2\x80\x99t know really what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. So that\xe2\x80\x99s a big part of the explanation is that we\xe2\x80\x99re in an unprecedented explosion in technological advances. A lot of us lawyers are having trouble keeping up with the ever changing information revolution. &lt;\n              <em>Well, to be honest, for me it still feels like slow motion, especially when using a PC.</em>\n              &gt; So that\xe2\x80\x99s another part of the quadrant.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img alt="ethics duality imbalance" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/ethics-duality-imbalance-small1.jpg?w=450" title="ethics duality imbalance" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4548"></img>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              And then just real quickly, the other two quadrant sectors are the ethics rules\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get into this in a minute \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c where you have the client advocacy duties balanced by the professional duties to tell the truth to the court and the duty\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0to opposing counsel to cooperate. That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been getting enough attention among lawyers until very recently with Judge Grimm and the Sedona\n              <em>Cooperation Proclamation</em>\n              . \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0The professional duties have been over-shadowed by that other very popular duty to vigorously advocate on your client\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 That has gotten out of hand on\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0occasion\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and that\xe2\x80\x99s the other part of the explanation. Because this is the kind of thing clients understand; they see when you are shouting on their behalf and they may reward that financially.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 But they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why it is that you may have a duty to disclose email that\xe2\x80\x99s going to hurt their case and you have a duty to cooperate. So that gets less financial rewards. I get into the economics involved in all of this as well.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into too much detail except to say the law review article\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0is coming out soon and if you have my second book,\n              <em>Introduction to E-Discovery</em>\n              , Chapter 6 begins with a version of this same article. \xe2\x80\xa6 from page 385 all the way to 404. \xe2\x80\xa6 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Then in the book I get into all of the lessons of\n              <em>Qualcom</em>\n              , which of course is the big \xe2\x80\xa6 e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery ethics case of the decade. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any cases worse than\n              <em>Qualcomm</em>\n              .\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>ABA Model Rule 1.1 of Professional\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Conduct </strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              KARL: Yep, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. All right, well let\xe2\x80\x99s \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c let\xe2\x80\x99s go through some of the rules here. Rule 1.1,\n              <strong>Competence</strong>\n              , of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct says a\n              <em>lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</em>\n              Okay, how do we get in trouble here with ethics and e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: This is the core problem and this is, you know, why we need more and better training. The problem is,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0e-discovery isn\xe2\x80\x99t taught in 95% of the law schools, so lawyers are coming out of law school with no information on it, no e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery competence. And in most law firms, except for a very few, typically the larger law firms \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c in most law firms, there are no e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery lawyers that have done this for years and have gained competence in it one way or the other. So people are all sort of floundering around, which is why your radio show is so important and other educational efforts like that. &lt;\n              <em>A little flattery of the interviewer never hurts.</em>\n              &gt;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              People, you know, they need the information out there. It\xe2\x80\x99s why CLEs for e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery continue to be filled even in these rough economic times. People understand that they need to learn this because the whole notion of discovery, it\xe2\x80\x99s now all e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery. Very few writings are created on paper, so 98, 99 percent of our writings today are electronically generated.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Some of them are printed out &lt;\n              <em>Yeah, like that Illinois lawyer. No, must stop thinking about that!</em>\n              &gt;, but a relatively small percentage. Usually the hottest information in any case is going to be the inadvertent information in the electronic mails, the text messages, the instant messages, that short of thing, where people are still saying, you know, incredibly dumb things. &lt;\n              <em>Or including things on their legal web banned in most states</em>\n              .&gt; So to ignore electronic information is to ignore writings. &lt;W\n              <em>ritings include photographs you know, all kinds of photographs</em>\n              .&gt; You just can\xe2\x80\x99t conduct litigation &lt;\n              <em>or Bar ethics investigations in Illinois</em>\n              &gt; in a competent manner and not look at all of your writings, not look at the original electronic versions of writings instead of just relying upon, you know, what the client may happen to print out and say, \xe2\x80\x9chere, take a look at this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              One of my favorite cases I like to talk about, maybe because it\xe2\x80\x99s a Florida case and not everyone knows about it, is\n              <em>Martin v. Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. </em>\n              That\xe2\x80\x99s a 2006 Westlaw case, 148991, Middle District of Florida, where the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, he was suing for disability benefits.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 He produced paper that his client \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c he was representing another plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attorney \xe2\x80\xa6 and they said \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s all we got; those are all the writings we have.\xe2\x80\x99 \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0The insurance company, Northwestern Mutual, eventually proved that that was wrong. They eventually found that they had several thousand pages of email and other records that weren\xe2\x80\x99t produced.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 And so they were called in front of the Magistrate Judge on a sanctions motion, and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s excuse was, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Judge, but me and my client, we\xe2\x80\x99re both\n              <em>computer illiterate</em>\n              .\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know how to get to that sort of stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Believe me, this excuse has been used for a long time in courts. It\xe2\x80\x99s still used today in state courts all over the country. But in federal court, and when he did it in 2006, the response of Judge Pizo was to call that \xe2\x80\x9cfrankly ludicrous.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a quote.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Judges don\xe2\x80\x99t usually call what counsel says ludicrous. &lt;\n              <em>Of course, they think it all of the time, but you have to be incredibly bad for them to actually come out and say it.</em>\n              &gt; \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Here the judge said it the writing; sanctions were imposed against the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0plaintiff. This case represents the death knell of this whole, \xe2\x80\x9cgee, judge, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x9d as a valid way to avoid doing your job and finding the writings, even though they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been printed out. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0This \xe2\x80\x9c\n              <em>frankly ludicrous</em>\n              \xe2\x80\x9d reaction is what I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find in every federal court in the country now.

So what they end up doing is over-review, they look at too many documents. The vendors are not really helping to keep the expenses down because it\xe2\x80\x99s not in their best interest to do so. &lt;\n              <em>Of course, the lawyers love it too.

Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it also a battle even with the structure, say you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it right and you have that competence established, to get every lawyer to pick up the phone when they have a matter and say, \xe2\x80\x9chey, I may have an issue here\xe2\x80\x9d?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c it\xe2\x80\x99s a real educational challenge. &lt;\n              <em>He\xe2\x80\x99s baiting me here.

Got to be careful.</em>\n              &gt; The large firms, like my firm, we have the advantage in that, you know, we can have a few people become an expert in it. But then we have the disadvantage of having literally hundreds of litigation lawyers and training them to pick up the phone and do that, that just takes time. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s like, can you teach an old dog new tricks?\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 Yes you can, but it takes a lot of effort. Litigators are used to doing discovery on their own. It\xe2\x80\x99s a hard shock for them to realize that there may be part of discovery that they can\xe2\x80\x99t handle. They don\xe2\x80\x99t like to admit that, but slowly they will start to and will turn to specialists for help.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This point was learned recently by a very good firm, Reed Smith, who has some 1500 lawyers, including some excellent e-discovery lawyers. Yet in the\n              <em>Bray and Gillespie v. Lexington Insurance</em>\n              case just this March, the law firm itself was sanctioned for e-discovery mistakes. It was sanctioned for the actions of two of its attorneys, shareholders.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 It was an Orlando district court case.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the law firm resources; it\xe2\x80\x99s because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for the help, these two shareholders just did it on their own.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This is the wake up call,\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://ralphlosey.wordpress.com/2009/04/18/part-2-the-grilling-by-mary-mack-angry-ostriches-judge-scheindlin-malcolm-gladwell-jack-nicholson-pretend-lawyers-volunteers-for-america-and-a-tad-more/" shape="rect">\n                the\n                <em>Bray and Gillespie</em>\n                case\n              </a>\n              .\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge wake-up call for law firms to start imposing some discipline in making sure that larger firms actually use the resources that they\xe2\x80\x99re given.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 The citation for that by the way is 2009 WestLaw 546429, Middle District Florida, March 4, 2009.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a very important case.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 I know my good friend, Browning Marean of DLA Piper thinks this case is more important than the\n              <em>Qualcomm</em>\n              case because it sends a message to the law firms themselves that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make sure that the knowledge is actually being used.

Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to another rule here. Another of the client duties \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c diligence. Rule 1.3 on diligence says:\n              <em>A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</em>\n              How do we get in trouble here in e-discovery with that?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big one. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to credit New Jersey and\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.klgates.com/files/upload/eDAT_rules_D_N_J_LCivR26_1.pdf" shape="rect">their local rules</a>\n              for emphasizing this many years ago when New Jersey began to require counsel to talk right away with the IT department of the client to make sure that preservation holds are properly implemented, the auto deletion functions are turned off. The New Jersey rule also requires counsel appearing in cases in New Jersey to talk right away with the key custodians about making sure their evidence is preserved.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Then Judge Scheindlin in\n              <em>Zubalake</em>\n              in her opinion in 2004 picked up on that theme out of New Jersey. She created what I and others are now calling the\n              <em>Zubalake Duty</em>\n              . You\xe2\x80\x99ll see that written about\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://ralphlosey.wordpress.com/zubu-duty/" shape="rect">in my blog </a>\n              and in my books where, in her words \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c she says, \xe2\x80\x9c\n              <em>outside counsel are required \xe2\x80\x98to make certain that all potentially relevant information are identified and placed on hold</em>\n              .\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d So, she\xe2\x80\x99s actually putting that duty on outside counsel, not\n              <em> just</em>\n              the client, but on outside counsel, to make sure that the relevant information has been placed on hold.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This is controversial to many people who think this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be an outside lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s job, that diligence shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t include requiring the attorney to be sure everything is placed on hold. But under the\n              <em>Zubalake Duty</em>\n              , you are at least required to have the conversations and to give the advice. Now, if the client doesn\xe2\x80\x99t follow your advice, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably not going to be sanctioned for that. But on the other hand, you may sometimes be in a\n              <em>Qualcomm</em>\n              situation where if the client just blatantly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t follow your advice \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c and, by the way, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had this happen to me, but in theory it could happen \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c then, what you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do is withdraw.\n              <em>&lt;Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s secret thoughts: Well, come to think of it, I have been in that position before, or close to it, and I have withdrawn, but not over preservation issues, per se.</em>\n              &gt; That is because you\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to condone evidence being deleted. &lt;\n              <em>That\xe2\x80\x99s a big Duh!</em>\n              &gt;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Due diligence requires follow up with the client to tell them about their duties, talk to the right key people, explain what they have to do to make sure that relevant evidence isn\xe2\x80\x99t deleted. This is all supposed to happen quickly, which makes it so darn challenging. \xe2\x80\xa6 So this is another big problem \xe2\x80\x94 the duty of diligence has become a huge challenge, particularly in e-discovery in connection with preservation.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              KARL: You know, I almost feel like I should stop for a fictitious sponsor statement here. &lt;\n              <em>Oh no.

There were three Cs in\n              <em>Zubalake</em>\n              . Jim Daley, a good friend of mine, called it the\n              <em>Zen of </em>\n              <em>Zubalake</em>\n              . You have to Communicate with your IT people, you gotta Coordinate you know the stopping, the deleting, etc., and then you gotta Comply with the order. When you mess those up, there\xe2\x80\x99s always Cabernet, which is my Fourth C. We got Judge Scheindlin and Laura Zubalake to autograph the bottle. Used to bring them around to conferences. I still think there\xe2\x80\x99s a role as a tool for a good bottle of wine in e-discovery.

So now we\xe2\x80\x99re talking an appellate circuit case which came out on March 18, 2009. What\xe2\x80\x99s interesting about this is the attorney here just took emails that were given to him from his client without doing the diligence of asking: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get those emails? How is it you came to have the emails of this employee who is suing us now?\xe2\x80\x9d Because they were very personal, private emails. The attorney didn\xe2\x80\x99t really do the diligence required to find out \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c at least I assume he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication in the opinion to indicate that he knew that these emails were in fact hacked from the employee\xe2\x80\x99s private on-line account. &lt;\n              <em>I have </em>\n              <em>\n                <a target="_blank" href="http://ralphlosey.wordpress.com/2009/03/29/new-4th-circuit-ruling-on-illegal-e-discovery-adds-teeth-to-federal-anti-hacker-email-privacy-law/" shape="rect">written about this case before</a>\n              </em>\n              .&gt;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img alt="monkeys" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/monkeys.jpg?w=450" title="monkeys" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269"></img>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This is a crime and it subjected this defendant company to a punitive damages award even though there was no proof of any actual damages from having the employee\xe2\x80\x99s private email hacked into.

He knew or figured out her user name and password and he stole her email. Then just turned it over to his attorney, who blithely said, \xe2\x80\x9coh, okay, thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d and used it as surprise on a cross-examination of her deposition. So this is something you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to understand, the evidence and where it\xe2\x80\x99s coming from. This is just a different kind of example where the attorney didn\xe2\x80\x99t do his homework and in fact ended up using evidence that was procured in a criminal manner by his client.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              KARL: All right.

Okay. How do we get in trouble here?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s two things that are really hyper about that. One is, we haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t talked about the duty of cooperation yet, but it kind of dovetails in with this duty of confidentiality, particularly in e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery, where sometimes we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re going to have to disclose to opposing counsel things that we used to keep secret as work product. &lt;\n              <em>Nothing critical mind you, but stuff needed for CYA</em>\n              .&gt;\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0It used to be kept confidential how you would do your searches. The key words that you might use to search through your own client\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s data. That typically was something you just wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t share with the other side. None of their business. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s my work product. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m going to keep it confidential. &lt;\n              <em>Afraid it would give away your theory of the case; more likely it would give away how lame your searches were.</em>\n              &gt; The other thing is keeping client\xe2\x80\x99s secrets. &lt;\n              <em>Now those are the important secrets</em>\n              .&gt; In a minute, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll explain how both of these confidentiality duties kind of dovetailed together\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0in the\n              <em>Victor Stanley</em>\n              case.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              But the other duty is to not produce to the other side attorney/client communications. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the client\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s privilege, as you know, to keep things secret. The client typically instructs you, the lawyer: \xe2\x80\x9cNot to turn over our secret emails to each other; I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t want to waive that privilege; I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t want the person who sued me, for instance, to see what we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been talking about in connection with this case or in connection with anything.\xe2\x80\x9d So part of e-discovery, one of the most expensive parts of e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery, is to review documents that have already been found to be relevant and to remove from those documents the attorney/client communications. These things are protected by attorney/client privilege, or all other kinds of privilege. Then also to review and protect documents that are confidential, that might just be trade secrets of your client and to protect them in various ways.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Focusing in on the duty to keep the communications between an attorney and their client secret, which is what this ethical duty is talking about, is a very important duty. This came to head in the\n              <em>Victor Stanley v. Creative Pipe</em>\n              case. Everybody that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s an e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery junkie knows this one by Magistrate Judge Paul Grimm. It was decided almost a year ago now, May 29, 2008. If you haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t seen it, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll find it discussed in my books and also\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://ralphlosey.wordpress.com/2008/06/08/hundredth-blog-thoughts-on-search-and-victor-stanley-inc-v-creative-pipe-inc/" shape="rect">in the blog</a>\n              . It also pertained to the reasonable diligence requirement, in that the people doing that final review of relevant documents to remove privilege, they missed over 300 privileged documents and they produced them to the other side. Their duty to keep things confidential was breached at that point. They were then invited to explain to the court and the other side whether they conducted a reasonable search. If they were able to prove a reasonable search, they might have been able to prevent the privilege from being waived.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s where the other confidentiality concerns reared their ugly head; they in effect said \xe2\x80\x9cNope, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not going to tell you what our search terms were. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s our work product. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re keeping that confidential. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not revealing it.\xe2\x80\x9d So, faced with that scenario where 300 documents were produced and they claimed it was accidental, but they wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t explain what they did to try and catch them at all, Judge Grimm found that there was a waiver of the privilege. He did not find that there had been a quality assurance testing program. Basically, he didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t find that what they had done to try and protect the confidentiality of their client\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s information was reasonable. So that was a duty on the shoulders of the attorney which they didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t discharge, and here it cost the client the loss of their privilege.\n            </p>\n            <p>KARL: I should throw a little plug in there. I haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t set the date yet, but Judge Grimm has agreed to do a pod cast talking to one other judge. Want to do something on sort of from a 10,000 foot level search and retrieval from the judge\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s perspective. So I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll keep you updated on that.</p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: Well, yeah, having Judge Grimm talk about it would be great. You know, Rule 502, the new evidence code, has addressed some of these problems to a degree, and maybe taken some of the pressure off us, but it is still, I think, one of the fundamental problems we have in e-discovery, and that is doing an affordable privilege review to try and catch these things. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m sure you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll have other shows just dealing with Rule 502. That is a big help.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Expediting Litigation by Strategic Cooperation</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img alt="cooperation lion" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/cooperation-lion.jpg?w=450" title="cooperation lion" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4651"></img>\n              KARL: Okay. Rule 3.2, Expediting Litigation is another rule that you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve thrown into the cocktail mix here.\n              <em>A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.</em>\n              How does that relate to e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s key. I mean, that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the core ethics rule behind\n              <em>The Sedona Conference</em>\n              <em>Cooperation Proclamation</em>\n              , which if you haven\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t heard of it, go to\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://thesedonaconference.org" shape="rect">TheSedonaConference.org</a>\n              website, download and read it. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s being signed on to by judges everywhere. It is also \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c speaking of Judge Grimm again \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c the core message in his case\n              <em>Mancia v. Mayflower Textile Services</em>\n              , which came out in October of 2008. &lt;\n              <em>See </em>\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://ralphlosey.wordpress.com/2008/10/19/a-new-opinion-by-judge-grimm-makes-the-legal-case-for-cooperative-discovery/" shape="rect">\n                <em>my prior blog</em>\n              </a>\n              <em> on this important case.</em>\n              &gt;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This is yet another key case to understand this whole business of keeping the cost of e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery down, which is a core problem. Part of the reason e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery costs get out of control is people lose track of this ethical duty we have to move things along. That really is in the interest of your client. Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s stipulate to things. Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s have more transparency and cooperation.  Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s stop this old game of hide the ball. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s never been ethically allowed, but we all know it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s gone on for years and years.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Maybe in the paper world where people were competent, that wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t blow the client\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s budget out of the water. But nowadays, when you start playing hide the ball and start playing games in e-discovery, and start trying to be obstructionist, when you start filing boilerplate objections to everything and you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t cooperate, before you know it, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re going to have the tail wagging the dog. You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re going to have e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery be the most important part of your case. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s going to cost you hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars, just to get involved in sorting out the e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery quagmire and the confusion in the disputes. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not what litigation is about.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Litigation is about the merits of the case. Discovery is just a way to get to the truth to then argue about the merits. So my message, and the message of\n              <em>The Sedona Conference,</em>\n              is let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s cooperate on getting the information on the table. Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s stop trying to play games and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0one-upmanship\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and fighting over that. Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s then fight on what the facts mean. Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s fight on what the law is. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s plenty of room for arguments and disputes, but let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not fight over what should the format of production be, metadata this, metadata that. I mean, most of these arguments that I see in cases are totally unnecessary. You have just run up a bill needlessly on the clients. They think you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re being a vigorous advocate, but really you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not. You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve lost track of your duty to move things along, which is by the way, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule Number One: quick, just, inexpensive adjudication. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s what we need to be doing. E\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery has got to stop being the whipping boy against this and the way to do it is by cooperating, which is why I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m such a strong believer in what Sedona is doing in that area.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              KARL: Yeah, we did a show with Richard Braman who heads\n              <em>The Sedona Conference</em>\n              on the\n              <em>Cooperation Proclamation</em>\n              . It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s interesting stuff and certainly critical.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img alt="Yalta_summit_1945_with_Churchill,_Roosevelt,_Stalin" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/yalta_summit_1945_with_churchill_roosevelt_stalin.jpg?w=450" title="Yalta_summit_1945_with_Churchill,_Roosevelt,_Stalin" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4681"></img>\n              RALPH: You know, I hear some people say, oh, well, that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s wimpy, But the truth of the matter is, this is not just rolling over and giving what the other side wants. This is mutual cooperation. This is what I call\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n              <em>\n                <strong>strategic cooperation</strong>\n              </em>\n              <em> </em>\n              to benefit your client. You have got to pick your battles. One of your battles shouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be over e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery. The battle should be on the merits of the case. The people that think this is just a mistake to cooperate, they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not really getting it. They\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re part of the problem, they\xe2\x80\x99re running up the cost of e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery. This is something that we all have to kind of move beyond our old mindset. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s nothing wrong with cooperating and in fact, the ethics and the rules require it.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              KARL: We did a really nice show with Ariana Tadler last week on the plaintiff perspective. She\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a prominent lawyer at Milberg and one of the few really well known e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery experts on that side. She talked about the meet and confer, about how she goes in with letters and what we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re looking for and sort of an olive branch essentially to try to get the case going the right way. But it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s tempered with healthy skepticism at the same time, you know, because it doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t work all the time that way. And the cases where it works are far better, she said, in terms \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c for both sides.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: Well, I always say it takes\n              <em>two to tango</em>\n              and you know, if one side won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t cooperate, that doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t mean that you give and all they do is take. If they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t give back and don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t cooperate, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve got one clear solution. You go to the judge. You go to the judge quickly and right away. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s what all of the judges say they want. So, you know, if you get one side that won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t cooperate with you, you do your best, you make your paper record, you make it clear you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re wearing the white hat, and you take it to the judge. You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re going to find out those judges are going to insist on cooperation. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s no tolerance in the federal bench for this at all.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Candor Towards the Tribunal</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img alt="fingers crossed" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/fingers-crossed.jpg?w=450" title="fingers crossed" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4655"></img>\n              KARL: That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a good lead in to the next rule, candor toward the tribunal. Rule 3.3, which says in various parts and subparts (a):\n              <em>A</em>\n              <em>lawyer shall not knowingly (1) make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer . . . or (3) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false </em>\n              . . . .

But nevertheless, the lawsuit in San Diego district court, even though it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s over and the jury ruled against Qualcom over a year ago now, it continues for the question of what kind of sanctions are appropriate against the outside counsel who represented Qualcomm.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              There will be a trial on this we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re told later this year, probably near the end of 2009, to assess the blame. Who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s to blame for the false statements being made to the judge, to the jury, to the opposing counsel about the email of Qualcomm, about the denial that was made by Qualcomm from the moment they filed suit, that they had any information concerning their cooperation in this organization, technical organization concerning their patent. They basically tried to hide the elephant. &lt;\n              <em>Almost got away with it too. Makes you wonder how many times they pulled this kind of \xe2\x80\x9cevil magic\xe2\x80\x9d in the past.</em>\n              &gt; They responded to requests for production on numerous occasions by saying \xe2\x80\x9cno, we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t have any responsive email concerning this.\xe2\x80\x9d They had deposition testimony in advance of trial where everybody toed the party line: \xe2\x80\x9cnope, we didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t do this, we didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, it turned out there was one honest witness at trial, into like the second week of trial, who said \xe2\x80\x9coh, yes, I think there was an email or two on that. I happen to remember a couple.\xe2\x80\x9d\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Because of that one honest witness \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c the jury by the way ruled against Qualcomm very quickly after that \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0because of that testimony, which was contrary to all the representations that had been made by Qualcomm before and during the trial, the district court judge said in effect \xe2\x80\x9cI want a hearing and I want to find out if there were intentional misrepresentations made by lawyers to the court, made to the jury, made to opposing counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s what triggered this investigation into the conduct where in the judge\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s words, the judge is convinced &lt;\n              <em>among other things</em>\n              &gt; that he was lied to at a side bar conference during trial, \xe2\x80\xa6 convinced that lawyers tried to hide evidence and were not truthful.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              So this is the core thing. The judges have to understand, and they have to be confident, that when lawyers tell them things, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the truth. If they can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t trust the lawyers to tell them the truth, who can they trust? That is the highest duty that we lawyers have, is to be honest to the judges. When you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t do that, you know, you deserve the rebukes, you deserve the sanctions, you deserve the ethical things. This is the core value \xe2\x80\x93 telling the truth. Lawyers telling the truth to judges, lawyers telling the truth to each other and being honest in their discovery. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s why this is a core message for litigation across the board, that \xe2\x80\xa6 our system of justice won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t work, if people are lying. Now, litigants may lie, there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s perjury for that. Maybe, you know, that happens. &lt;\n              <em>We all know it happens all of the time.</em>\n              &gt; But lawyers should never lie and that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s basically what this rule is about, that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s what\n              <em>Qualcomm</em>\n              is about.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Fairness</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img \n              alt="3 manatees cooperating by sharing one fresh water source.

Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s go into the final rule that we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll discuss on this, Rule 3.4, which is fairness to opposing party and counsel. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve touched a little on this:\n              <em>A </em>\n              <em>lawyer shall not (a) unalwfully obstruct another party\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s access to evidence or unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value. A lawyer shall not counsel or assist another person to do any such act. </em>\n              Then in part (b):\n              <em> in pretrial procedure make a frivolous discovery request or fail to make a reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party</em>\n              . . . . So how does that play into this issue, Ralph?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: Well, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve already kind of talked about it. This is the duty to cooperate; this is the\n              <em>Mancia</em>\n              case and Judge Grimm; this is more of the ethical underpinning of why it is you need to cooperate. You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re required by ethics, by being a lawyer, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re required to cooperate on this level. Unfortunately, we still see happening, time and time again, lawyers are not discharging their professional duties.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              There is another case, not as well known, but I would point the listeners to. It demonstrates non-cooperation, not following this. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s called\n              <em>U&amp;I Corporation v. Advanced Medical Design</em>\n              , 2008 WL 821993. Again, this is one coming out of Florida, which is why I happen to know about it, dated March 26, 2008. &lt;\n              <em>It is an Akerman Senterfitt case where we obtained a sanctions award against a very uncooperative plaintiff.</em>\n              &gt; This is an important case because it shows how a defendant can insist on cooperation from the plaintiff that was suing them here. When they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t, you can get sanctions. \xe2\x80\xa6\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img alt="dragged kicking and screaming" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/kicking-screaming-police.jpg?w=450" title="dragged kicking and screaming" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4671"></img>\n              Just one brief quote from the Magistrate Judge, Elizabeth Jenkins, who says, \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93\n              <em>It is not the court\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s role, nor that of opposing counsel, to drag a party kicking and screaming through the discovery process.</em>\n              \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd I think that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s an important quote. You know, if you can show that to the judge, that that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s what you have had to do because they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not cooperating, they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not being forthright, they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re basically fighting you every inch of the way, you will get relief. If you apply to the court for relief, cite to the\n              <em>U&amp;I Corporation</em>\n              case, cite to\n              <em>Mancia</em>\n              , point out the duty to cooperate, and you can stop this. Because unfortunately, you know, a lot of people don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t get the cooperation memo. In the real world, most people are still not cooperating. So that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s why it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s important to know about these ethical requirements, know about these cases where lawyers are having their hands slapped when they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t fulfill their duties.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>What\xe2\x80\x99s It All About, Alfie?</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <img height="206" width="240" alt="Alfie" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/alfie.jpg?w=240&amp;h=206" title="Alfie" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4615"></img>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              KARL: How do these \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c I mean, you know, there are these six rules and I really liked your quadrant. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m going to attach your blog, your description in a description of the show, so that people can link to it. But, how do these rules sort of compete with each other.

Because a client doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t really win when a lawyer is fighting over everything with opposing counsel. Now, the client might at first get a few\n              <em>rah, rahs</em>\n              out of that: \xe2\x80\x9cOh boy, yeah, he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s fighting for my side!\xe2\x80\x9d But you know what? After he starts getting the bills for this month after month, year after year, it stops being so exciting to the client. We all know that that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not really in the client\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s best interest to be fighting over everything. &lt;\n              <em>Only the lawyer wins then, the client loses, whether they win the case or not</em>\n              .&gt; That kind of vigorous advocacy is something that even the biggest corporations can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t afford. They need to cooperate. Then the client will win.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the point of all of this.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <strong>\n                We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re here in the legal profession to represent parties that are in disputes, to give them legal advice.

I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m almost thinking of my ethics class in law school and Judge Weddick here in Pennsylvania is a well known state court judge here, teaches it. And, you know, he would take one side or the other, and we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d only attack one rule at a time. I threw six of them at you. Almost impossible.

Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s try to hit on a couple of these solutions. Try to wrap this up in a couple of tips for the listeners.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Three-Fold Solution</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: We might as well end on practical, positive stuff. &lt;\n              <em>Assuming, of course, that I can climb off of my high horse for a second!</em>\n              &gt; Right now I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m talking about a three-fold solution, trying to keep it simple. &lt;\n              <em>Tomorrow, it may be a five-fold solution; whatever.</em>\n              &gt; So, number one is e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98discovery teams. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s why I call my blog the\n              <em>e\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98Discovery Team</em>\n              . The message there is that lawyers, techs, and management need to all work together as a team. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s part of the way to overcome the competence problem is get a tech \xe2\x80\x93 not tied to the hip as Craig Ball likes to say he wants to avoid \xe2\x80\x93 but get a tech on your team. Learn to collaborate. Stop being the \xe2\x80\x94 you know &lt;\n              <em>arrogant jerk</em>\n              &gt;. Perry Mason, he used a detective; today\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s lawyer needs to have a tech. &lt;\n              <em>\n                <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Drake_(fictional_detective)" shape="rect">Paul Drake</a>\n              </em>\n              <em> </em>\n              <em>with a pocket protector?</em>\n              &gt; They need to have a geek that they can work with.

That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s number one.\n            </p>\n            <p>Number two is cooperation and be transparent in what you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re doing. Cooperate with the other side, fulfill your duty of disclosure, take that seriously; save the arguments for the law. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve already talked about that.

That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the other group, Anne Kershaw\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s group,\n              <em>\n                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ediscoveryinstitute.org/founders.html" shape="rect">E\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x98Discovery Institute</a>\n              </em>\n              .\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              So that to me is the core problem, and the solution to it is using statistics and sampling and just getting a more disciplined handle on how much we actually review. In other words, how to cull down things a lot. So that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the third prong of the solution. Use teams, cooperate, and figure out how to do search better by using some sort of metric analysis.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              KARL: I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t get to say this very often, but that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s what brought me back into the field is focusing in on that specific issue. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c if you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve lived off of the other model, which is throwing lots of bodies at the problem, you realize just how inefficient it is. And then when you study the studies, the\n              <em>Blair Maron</em>\n              case and anyone that looked at that sort of brute force based on people, it doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t work and it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s very, very expensive. You know, there are tools out there. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s really fascinating, and it ties right back into your first thread about people learning new skills and working together as a team. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s interesting how this all fits together.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              RALPH: Well, thank you for having me on the show, and thank you to all the listeners &lt;\n              <em>and readers</em>\n              &gt; for having the patience to hang in there.

But there were many\n              <em>additional</em>\n              reasons for us to go\n              <em>all out</em>\n              with a professional vendor. In fact, there are many good reasons for\n              <em>any law firm</em>\n              to phase out their e-discovery processing and software hosting services. They are\n              <em>not</em>\n              legal services. So why are we selling them?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Vendors cannot provide legal services, neither can so-called\n              <em>technology consultants</em>\n              , even if they are licensed attorneys. \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Only properly licensed lawyers practicing law can provide legal services. Indeed, the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0unauthorized\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0practice of law is a crime in most states, albeit usually just a\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0misdemeanor. So the services that e-discovery vendors provide necessarily cannot be legal services. All of them will tell you that, but I suspect a few of them cross the line when a practicing lawyer or judge is not looking.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The one special exception to this involves the use of outside contract lawyers for document review. These are legal services, but they are rendered under the direct supervision of counsel of record, not the vendor. This kind of legal outsourcing is governed by various state rules of ethics and is not what I am referring to here.

That includes our core services of labor and employment law and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0e-discovery law.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This move has also eliminated, for us, the many tricky issues facing all law firms who have a litigation support department that charges clients for non-legal e-discovery services. These are complex, highly technical, and expensive services. Many require a great deal of training and education to do correctly. Anyone who thinks it is just a little more difficult than making paper copies is out of touch. Some of these non-legal activities are just as difficult as the practice of law. Some of the computer work involved is very difficult to do correctly. It also requires a very substantial capital investment for equipment and software to run these computer services. Efficient management of these enterprises is also difficult. So is\n              <em>fair billing</em>\n              \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0of these charges to clients.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For all of these reasons, even though\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0my firm is the first\n              <em>AmLaw 10</em>\n              0 firm to outsource all of its non-legal e-discovery business activities to a vendor, I expect many others firms will soon follow. So does\n              <em>Kroll Ontrack</em>\n              . So did a whole lot of other vendors who participated in our extensive RFP. They are gearing up now.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Outsourcing Non-Legal Services to e-Discovery Vendors Is Good For Clients and Good For Our System of Justice</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <a href="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/outsourcing.jpg" shape="rect">\n                <img height="213" width="220" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/outsourcing.jpg?w=220&amp;h=213" title="outsourcing" class="alignright wp-image-18575"></img>\n              </a>\n              Outsourcing makes sense for the non-core functions that are beyond the mission and special expertise of an organization. What could be more non-core for a law firm than non-legal services? This is especially true for complex computer processing, computer forensics and software services. Putting clients\xe2\x80\x99 interests first requires this kind of team work.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <em>Kroll Ontrack\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0</em>\n              responded favorably to my constant public harping in this blog and elsewhere, for inexpensive, advanced software. The volume justified the deal, as did the precedential value. We can now use\n              <em>Advanceview</em>\n              and\n              <em>Inview</em>\n              software in all size cases, not just the biggest. I contend that the significant price move will allow\n              <em>Kroll Ontrack</em>\n              to make up in volume what they have lost in margin. It was a smart business move and win-win for everyone. I suggest that all other vendors be open to similar deals with their customers.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Our negotiations with\n              <em>Kroll Ontrack</em>\n              took nearly nine months, with my primary contact being\n              <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-wall/3/a54/335" shape="rect">Chris Wall</a>\n              , an attorney and tech expert. I met with many\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n              <em>Kroll Ontrack</em>\n              executives to make this deal, including their President and CEO,\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dean-hager/1a/468/26b" shape="rect">Dean Hager</a>\n              . I met with even more of their front line professionals to set up a custom work flow, iron out details, and set up extensive training.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0I cannot begin to name all of the people I have worked with\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0to make this happen, but I did notice that one of\n              <em>Kroll Ontrack\xe2\x80\x99s</em>\n              leaders,\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joel-vogel/4/92a/553" shape="rect">Joel Vogel</a>\n              , has a\n              <em>YouTube</em>\n              video online. So I thought it would be fun to showcase him for special\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0embarrassment. After all, he did put up with several of my outbusts when I was fighting to get even more favorable terms for our clients. Joel\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0is currently\n              <em>Sr. Vice President, Worldwide Legal Technologies</em>\n              , but back in 2010 when this video was shot at\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n              <em>Kroll Ontrack</em>\n              studios, he was known as the\n              <em>Chief Service Evangelist</em>\n              .\n            </p>\n            <span style="text-align:center; display: block;" class="embed-youtube">\n              <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UU9Mw5K0bEJ-EBy-Vhs7-XTA&amp;hl=en_US" height="284" width="450" type="text/html" class="youtube-player" scrolling="auto" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n            </span>\n            <p>\n              I have no doubt that other law firms will soon follow our lead with\n              <em>Kroll Ontrack</em>\n              \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and other vendors. It just makes sense for law firms to focus on the practice of law and leverage the volume of their litigation for the benefit of all their clients.\n            </p>\n            <p>It is true that some clients do not need this, the few sophisticated mega-corporations that have already made vendor deals leveraging the volume of their e-discovery needs. But most companies have not done so, at least not yet.</p>\n            <p>Some companies, since they are a business to begin with, and not a law firm, have set up and run internal e-discovery business to serve their own needs. Some companies do this well, but many do not, because again, like law firms, the e-discovery business is not their core competency.</p>\n            <p>\n              Many of these companies are now realizing their limitations, and the complexity of running e-discovery services, and are also turning to outsourcing. In fact, my due diligence of outsourcing in general showed that in-house law departments are ahead of law firms, and many have already turned to outsourcing. So although we are the first large law firm to outsource all non-legal e-discovery, several corporations have already gone that route, but not many. I predict that will change too, and change fast. Outsourcing non-legal e-discovery services to professional vendors is inevitable for both law firms and corporations. The trend will accelerate with the growing complexity of the technology and amount of data.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Electronic discovery vendors need to help themselves by making it easier for this shift to happen. All full service e-discovery vendors should consider making similar deals with other law firms and corporations for the general benefit of clients everywhere and our system of justice. We need to be able to get to the relevant facts in large volumes of data quickly and inexpensively.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0We need the new search and review technologies to be affordable for all size cases.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>No Slight Intended Against Other Vendors</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Please do not construe my comments, nor my firm\xe2\x80\x99s selection of\n              <em>Kroll Ontrack </em>\n              over others\n              <em>,</em>\n              \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0as a slight against\n              <em>all</em>\n              of the other e-discovery vendors and software manufacturers. The RFP had very stringent requirements, not just software excellence. We demanded not only the best software, but also national\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n              <em>one-stop-shopping</em>\n              for all non-legal e-discovery services, not just search and review software. This included an area that is very important for us, and our clients, namely forensic analysis and collection services. Very few national vendors could provide all of the non-legal services we needed.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Further, although many software manufacturers now partner with full service vendors, wherein their software is also bundled with other non-legal services, a few do not. One such software vendor is Recommind who makes one of our favorite predictive coding products,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.recommind.com/products/axcelerate-ediscovery" shape="rect">\n                <em>Axcelerate</em>\n              </a>\n              . A few other software programs were eliminated for similar reasons.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              So although I think\n              <em>Inview</em>\n              is a good product, and am especially impressed with the input that information scientist\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daviddlewis.com/" shape="rect">David D. Lewis</a>\n              has had on the programing design, that does not mean that I think\n              <em>all</em>\n              other competing programs are not good, or not at least as good.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I will say, however, without naming names, that not\n              <em>all</em>\n              software claiming to have predictive coding capacities are created equal. In fact, I did not like some of them. But please remember, as an avid software user and computer hobbyist since 1978, I have strong opinions about\n              <em>all software</em>\n              , not just e-discovery software, and I can spot\n              <em>bs</em>\n              a mile away. Plus, as you may have noticed, I tend to have strong opinions about things, when I have any opinion at all.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Predictive Coding Type Software Features Are Now Critical to the Practice of Law in the Information Explosion Age</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              There are many fine software programs out there with predictive coding type features.

It captures far more relevant documents, in other words, has better recall, and does so with much greater precision. Better precision means lawyers waste less time and money in final review of likely relevant documents before production.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0This means significant costs savings in document review. The Rand Corporation study understood this well.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0The conclusion of the report states at pages 97-99:\n            </p>\n            <p style="padding-left:60px;">\n              The most promising alternative available today for large-scale reviews is the use of predictive coding and other computerized categorization strategies that can rank electronic documents by the likelihood that they are relevant, responsive, or privileged. Eyes-on review is still required but only for a much smaller set of documents determined to be the most-likely candidates for production. Empirical research suggests that predictive coding is at least as accurate as humans in traditional large-scale review. Moreover, there is evidence that the number of hours of attorney time that would be required in a large-scale review could be reduced by as much as three-fourths, depending on the nature of the documents and other factors, which would make predictive coding one answer to the critical need of significantly reducing review costs. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Conclusion</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>Better quality and lower costs. The long elusive promise of technology as applied to e-discovery is finally coming true.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0That is why predictive coding is so important and why every lawyer would be well advised to get on the bandwagon as soon as possible.</p>\n            <p>\n              Clients are not stupid, especially sophisticated corporations with intelligent, cost-conscious in-house counsel. Predictive coding technology, when used correctly, saves money on review, perhaps as much as 75% according to the Rand Report. It also fits hand-in-glove with proportionality arguments to counter would-be e-discovery extortionists.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <a href="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/sullivan_and_north.jpg" shape="rect">\n                <img height="204" width="300" alt="" src="http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/sullivan_and_north.jpg?w=300&amp;h=204" title="Sullivan_and_North" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18482"></img>\n              </a>\n              Yet, in spite of this, most litigation attorneys have, until very recently, been afraid to use the new technology for the stated reason that it had never been approved by a court.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0When I first heard of this popular excuse, I thought back to the good old days of the 1980s and a famous trial lawyer I have always admired,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Sullivan" shape="rect">Brendan V. Sullivan</a>\n              . When representing Oliver North who was testifying before Congress about his role in the Iran-Contra affair, Sullivan responded to criticism from Senator Inouye\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0for his aggressive, bold objections with the famous line:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\n              <strong>\n                Well, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n                <em>potted plant</em>\n                . I\xe2\x80\x99m here as the lawyer\n              </strong>\n              .\xe2\x80\x9d That line was watched on tv by millions and was famous for years. All lawyers in the 80s admired him for it, so did everyone else. We need more gutsy lawyers like that today in e-discovery, not more e-discovery businessmen and techies.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The excuse of no-judicial approval for predictive coding is now gone. The main excuse still remaining for lawyers to refrain from the adoption of predictive coding methods is the perfectly valid and understandable one that they do not know how to do it. But that can be rectified by time, training and effort. There are many vendors and consultants that can help. I have been writing thousands of words to do my part to help the profession. More brass-tack descriptions will be coming on this blog, plus just read the e-discovery newspapers on popular cases.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              We can do it.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0We are lawyers, not potted plants. Besides, we really have no choice if we want to keep practicing law in the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Twenty-First\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Century.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0All sophisticated litigants will very soon rise up and demand that their lawyers use these new processes. Either that, or they will get new lawyers. That is the way of the world.\n            </p>\n            <div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled">\n              <div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled">\n

litigation as\n              <em>just a game,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0</em>\n              a game to be won at all costs.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Electronic discovery is just part of the game. The goal for such lawyers is not justice, and certainly not truth. The goal is to win the game by any means possible. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the personal profit and power that comes from winning, either by final judgment or settlement.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Law gamers don\xe2\x80\x99t care about justice. They are only in it for the money.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Truth Is Not Just A Construct</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              As a consequence, gamer lawyers do not see e-discovery as a way to get at the truth of a dispute. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the truth. Non-gamers ask for and look at documents to try to find out what really happened. But not gamers. They view facts as\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0malleable. E-discovery for them is just a way to find enough documents to construct a story. They only care about whether a story will likely persuade a judge or jury to rule in their client\xe2\x80\x99s favor. Not whether it is true.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Gamers view requests for discovery as potentially dangerous to their constructs. For that reason, they will play endless, elaborate games to try to hide the facts. For them\n              <em>hide-the-ball</em>\n              is just a game, one that might have economic consequences if they are caught, but they rarely are.

They assume that you have as little regard for the truth as they do. They assume that you, like them, are just trying to win at all costs. They assume you are trying to hide the ball just as much as they are. They assume your requests for production are as\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0exaggerated\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and extortion oriented as theirs.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              If someone, especially an opposing counsel, calls them on their gamesmanship, they think that too if just another game tactic.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0They tend to view all lawyers who call them on their gamesmanship as just\n              <em>\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0irritated gamers </em>\n              or\n              <em>\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0</em>\n              spoiled sports.

The first computer programs I ever wrote in the early 1980s were games, mostly for my kids. They still remember my\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n              <em>Mr. Computer Head</em>\n              , the world\xe2\x80\x99s first\n              <em>make-a-face</em>\n              program, which I created on my\n              <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A" shape="rect">\n                <em> Texas Instrument 99/4A</em>\n              </a>\n              using TI basic, assembly language, and some macine code. It had color graphics, music, some animation, and moving pixels (sprites). It even had one of the first speech synthesizers. After you assembled a face,\n              <em>Mr. Computer Head</em>\n              would smile approvingly and say:\n              <em>I sure look good now</em>\n              . It was fun creating and playing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to play much these days, but I still keep up with the latest thing.

According to game theory, the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93rational choice\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd in this situation is for each party to act uncooperatively and in bad faith, incurring the lesser disadvantage, so as to avoid the risk of the more severe disadvantage. Although the end result is disadvantageous to both (relative to acting cooperatively and in good faith), the disadvantage is less than would be incurred by one party behaving well, when the other party behaves poorly.

Incentives to conduct an ineffective or inefficient search arise largely from attempts to game the system, fear that an adversary will game the system, insufficient knowledge of the efficacy and cost of available search methods, and financial profit from the use (or failure to use) particular search methods. By and large, these incentives tend to be neutralized by the existing rules and ethical proscriptions when counsel are knowledgeable and competent with respect to search methods in e-discovery and strategies for their optimal use. The net effect is that the approach most beneficial to the client, and to the justice system, as well as least likely to violate the rules or ethical proscriptions, is to make an informed choice of the most effective, most efficient search method. Lawyers should not assume or insist that existing practices \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c such as exhaustive manual review \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c are always the best choice in the face of growing evidence that other methods can achieve as good, if not better results, at a fraction of the cost.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:center;">\n              <strong>Conclusion</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:left;">Litigation is not a game. It is an important governmental process central to our democratic system. Law is not a mere business. It is an important profession, a calling. Truth and justice, law and ethics, are core cultural values.</p>\n            <p style="text-align:left;">\n              Lawyers who ignore these values and employ game tactics are doomed to fail. If their opposition is also a gamer, then both will both lie and cheat each other. The clients on both sides will lose. If their opposition is not a gamer, they will also lose as soon as the judge who controls the proceeding catches on to their gamesmanship. Once they are exposed, they are done. You can easily stop unethical gamers by exposing them.\n            </p>\n            <p style="text-align:left;">\n              Message to lawyer gamers: quit the game. Play video games instead. If you just went into law to make money. Get out. Go into business. They have different ethics, different rules. You can win there. Maybe. But you cannot win here. The profession, especially the judges, will make sure of that. So will thousands of lawyers like me.
