If you spend your days with Balinese, you will probably get a story about Leak or Balinese
magic. And sometimes it is hard to believe it, but often it will make you very curious. To get
someone that can show you about this magic is not as easier as you get someone who can tell you
about Leak. In Bali, people have a bad image of Leak. They believe that Leak can make one fall
sick or killed. One wishing to learn about leak should devote his or her self to Durga, in hope
that She may bestow upon one the gift of being able to use leak’s mantra effectively. After
having achieved one’s end by means of offering and prayers recited during a mystic dance in
the middle of the night in the graveyard, then he will transform into a leak. A leak has a power to
change its appearance into an animal, a bike or a car, a flaming ghost (endih), a demon devil,
and others that he wants. A Leak has several ways to change its appearance: First, what
Balinese call leak pamoroan. It can change completely into animals that appear only during
the night. They try to suck their victims or just frighten them. Second, Tluh, a change of the
appearance but only its facial expression: The face is swollen, the eyes are distended and
glowing with the fixed gaze. They appear at daytime, exert themselves to stab their enemies
into stomach with a knife hidden in their hand. Third, higher level is tranjana. They can
appear during the day or the night. Their appearance is only to be seen indistinctly, partly
invisible, or as a shadow to straggle his victim. However to harm or kill someone, leak can also
use papasangan. It does not need to change his or her appearance. Sometimes, leaks are seen
involved in fights, measuring their power one against another. Common people usually are
unable to see the fights. And the one who losses the fight will fall ill or will show sitting of
blood and is doomed to death. A trained (leak’s master) will usually find it much easier to
transform its performance.. Having concentrated on a shape of an animal he is going to change
into and recited magical words (mantra) properly, then he will transform directly into a
leak. The leak is considered to be lower than mankind because what he eats include corpses and
everything putrefied. He sees a dead dog as a delicious food and he mistakes foul smell for
fragrance and perfume. Actually, Leak is not as bad as people think. It is like a knife: It can
help us or hurt us, depending on how and what we use it for. Mangku Ketut Rnam said that Leak more
is like a sharpened knowledge and “it is not bad as people think, it can be used to help people
although it can hurt people, too.” LK. Suryani, meditation expert, also shared Mangku
Tetut Rnam’s view, saying that people have misperception about leak. “People just see it
from the negative side. They do not realize that leak is just like a meditation or other kinds of
science,” she said. She believes that leak still exist in Bali. Ngurah Harta realizes that
challenges facing those who already have a bad image about leak. “Leak is one of our
heritages that need to be retained to prevent it from extinction. If leak is said to be a bad
thing, I do not agree. In fact, it will entirely depend on individuals themselves. If leak is
used for healing purposes, then it means good but when leak is used to harm people, it means
bad,” he said.    What's your opinion of this?

Is Unique Traditional Culture Reog Is Unique Traditional Culture

21:01 Reog Ponorogo is unique traditional culture from Indonesia especially from Ponorogo,
East Java. This tradition is identical with mistic. The most popular character in Reog
Ponorogo is Warok and Gemblak. the history of Reog Ponorogo is from the legend of rebellion of
Ki Ageng Kutu that is the servant of Majapahit Kingdom who the king had bad attitude. Ki Ageng
Kutu left the Kingdom and invited the young people to go with him and they learned about
mystical and self defense to strive again the kingdom, the message that Ki Ageng Kutu wanted to
deliver to the kingdom is showed by Reog Performance as allusion to Kingdom.



In Reog Ponorogo, it's performed the people who wear mask of lion head which is called " Singa
Barong" as the symbol of Kertabumi or the king of Majapahit. on top of the must they put feather
of peacock which is like giant fan which symbolize China who also hold up their life. there is
character which is called jatilan that is acted by the dancer who called Gemblak that
symbolize



the solder of Majapahit. The character which is symbolizing Ki Ageng Kerta is called Warok
that is the actor who wear red clown uniform. Warok lift up Singa Barong by using their theeth.
the weight of Singa Barong is for about 50 kg so it is impossible if the ordinary people do that
without magic.

Now, the art of Reog is performed in certain event such as weeding and great day. the
performance has changed, now Reog is performed by using 3 part of dancing, which consist of 6-8
Dancer. the dancer wear black clothes and their face are coloured by red colour. It symbolize
brave lion. Next dance is dance with is acted by girls who ride hourse. the dancer is not really
woman but the man who wear women clothes. the dance is called " Tari jaran Kepang". after
dancing the important part of this performance depends on the event if the event is about
Wedding, the play is about love. and the last scene is singa barong and Warok.

BIOGRAPHY OF ALBERT EINSTEIN BIOGRAPHY OF ALBERT EINSTEIN

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LVX-fi5F4ys/UCyuC3HOeiI/AAAAAAAAAF8/9HHCBKSHw5A/s1600/220px-Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg

Everybody know Albert Einstein.. who is he? he is my grandpa! haha

he was born at Ulm, in WÃŒrttemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family
moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they
moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered
the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and
mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he
was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss
Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor's degree.



During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced much of his remarkable
work and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he became Professor
Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague, returning to
Zurich in the following year to fill a similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director of the
Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin. He became a
German citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for
political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical
Physics at Princeton * . He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post in
1945.



After World War II, Einstein was a leading figure in the World Government Movement, he was
offered the Presidency of the State of Israel, which he declined, and he collaborated with Dr.
Chaim Weizmann in establishing the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.



Einstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination
to solve them. He had a strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way to
his goal. He regarded his major achievements as mere stepping-stones for the next advance.



At the start of his scientific work, Einstein realized the inadequacies of Newtonian
mechanics and his special theory of relativity stemmed from an attempt to reconcile the laws
of mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. He dealt with classical problems of
statistical mechanics and problems in which they were merged with quantum theory: this led to
an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules. He investigated the thermal
properties of light with a low radiation density and his observations laid the foundation of
the photon theory of light.



In his early days in Berlin, Einstein postulated that the correct interpretation of the
special theory of relativity must also furnish a theory of gravitation and in 1916 he
published his paper on the general theory of relativity. During this time he also contributed
to the problems of the theory of radiation and statistical mechanics.



In the 1920's, Einstein embarked on the construction of unified field theories, although he
continued to work on the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory, and he persevered
with this work in America. He contributed to statistical mechanics by his development of the
quantum theory of a monatomic gas and he has also accomplished valuable work in connection
with atomic transition probabilities and relativistic cosmology.



After his retirement he continued to work towards the unification of the basic concepts of
physics, taking the opposite approach, geometrisation, to the majority of physicists.



Einstein's researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include
Special Theory of Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950),
General Theory of Relativity (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926),
and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930),
Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most
important.



Albert Einstein received honorary doctorate degrees in science, medicine and philosophy
from many European and American universities. During the 1920's he lectured in Europe,
America and the Far East and he was awarded Fellowships or Memberships of all the leading
scientific academies throughout the world. He gained numerous awards in recognition of his
work, including the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1925, and the Franklin Medal
of the Franklin Institute in 1935.



Einstein's gifts inevitably resulted in his dwelling much in intellectual solitude and, for
relaxation, music played an important part in his life. He married Mileva Maric in 1903 and
they had a daughter and two sons; their marriage was dissolved in 1919 and in the same year he
married his cousin, Elsa LÃ¶wenthal, who died in 1936. He died on April 18, 1955 at
Princeton, New Jersey. By Ade Syntia Mustikasari | | 0 komentar

Ayub Medical College ( AMC ) ( Urdu , Pashto , Hindko : Ø§ÛŒÙˆØš
Ù…ÛŒÚˆÛŒÚ©Ù„ Ú©Ø§Ù„Ø¬ ) is a leading medical institute and one of
several medical colleges affiliated to Khyber Medical University located in Abbottabad ,
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan . [1 ] AMC is home to 1400 students in the MBBS and BDS programs,
with clinical rotations occurring at Ayub Teaching Hospital . The school has a large and
experienced faculty to support its mission of education, research, and clinical care.
Faculty members hold appointments at basic sciences and clinical departments. There are
approximately 100 full and part-time faculty members consisting of lecturers, assistants,
associate and full professors at AMC.





History OF AMC

AMC began functioning in May 1979 at the Education Extension Centre in Abbottabad after a
decision by the Government of Pakistan to establish another medical college outside the
Peshawar region and to further aid in the development of medical health care in the Hazara and
Gilgit-Baltistan region . The first batch of 100 students were accommodated at the Education
Extension Centre, while the present AMC campus and teaching hospital were being constructed
north of the town. The District Headquarters Hospital, Abbottabad remained affiliated to
Ayub Medical College upon the opening of Ayub Teaching Hospital in 1990. On December 30, 1990
the present campus of Ayub Medical College opened its doors to students and faculty. The name
of the college was chosen after former President Field Marshal Ayub Khan , who hailed from
Haripur . Today AMC hosts one of the largest medical school campuses in Pakistan





Ayub Medical Campus

At present the AMC campus consists of a medical school building, a teaching hospital, a
nursing school, a dental school and a paramedical institute with supporting amenities for
all students and staff. The medical school building has four air-conditioned, spacious
lecture halls with sophisticated audiovisual teaching aids, well-equipped laboratories ,
museums and an air-conditioned library . A self-learning resource centre with access to the
Digital Library of the Higher Education Commission is also available



 



Recognition

AMC is fully recognized by the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), General Medical
Council of the United Kingdom and Ireland and the World Health Organization (WHO). The
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan has recognized many of its departments for
post-graduate training such as Medicine , Surgery , Obstetrics & Gynaecology , Oral &
Maxillofacial Surgery and Pathology . The Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists of Britain has granted recognition to the Department of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology at AMC for the clinical training of the MRCOG candidates

http://i1196.photobucket.com/albums/aa406/radira_lla/Muach_Icon_Radira.gif When
Your Heart & Mind Disagree About The Break-Up When Your Heart & Mind Disagree About The
Break-Up

00:56





You are sitting with your cell phone staring at a text message you wrote to your ex hours ago. You
debate whether to send it or not. You stare at your phone while your mind tells you to have more
respect for yourself. You logically understand that sending the message is not going to make
the situation any better – nor will it heal your pain. Then your heart enters the scene and
overpowers your mind. Your heart says, “Go ahead, send it, you will feel
better…temporarily at least.”



Image: http://healmybrokenheart.com/mindsoul.jpg The scenario above represents one
example of a misalignment between your heart and your mind that is a common occurrence after a
break up. Every decision you make is determined by a combination of your logic and emotion . If
these different elements that make you who you are happen to conflict, you will
understandably feel conflicted and make decisions that reflect this turmoil.

The concept of alignment will help you understand why you may have been in a relationship that
was not good enough for you. It will also help you understand how to use your logic to help heal
your broken heart. Let’s look at some more examples of what happens when your heart and mind
disagree with one another.

Scenario 1 – During the Relationship

Your mind says, “I deserve more – this relationship is not right.”

Your heart says, “Stay, it will work out.”

If you were in a relationship where it was obvious that you were not receiving the love,
respect, and engagement that you deserve, then your mind was probably nudging you during the
relationship and asking you, “Why are we still here?” You remained in that relationship
for longer than you should have because your heart believed that your mate and relationship
could change.

Your heart believed that it was better to be in a relationship that was mediocre than to be
alone. Your heart was saying to you, “Hey, give it a chance, it’s not that bad.” Your mind
and heart were not aligned and this probably led to fighting, to an internal struggle, and
eventually the break up. Often when we want more from a relationship than we are getting, we
continually try to get ‘more’ by attempting to change the person we are with or by forcing
other changes in the relationship. This is generally a destructive path.



Scenario 2 – During the Relationship

Your heart says, “This relationship is everything I need.”

Your mind says, “There are red flags here that I shouldn’t ignore.”

When one partner in a relationship is not happy, they usually provide indications either
verbally, in the form of passive-aggressive behavior, or via non-verbal actions of their
discontent. If you are the other partner that is madly in love, you do actually receive the red
flags as signals in your mind. Unfortunately, your heart overpowers your logic in this case.
Your heart speaks so loudly about how in love you are and how perfect everything is, that you
drown out the messages your mind has received.

Eventually, after the break up, it is easier to see the red flags were present in your
relationship. You also may realize that some of the reason you were deeply attached to your ex
was because you loved the idea of being in love. If you relate to this scenario, remember, you
deserve a love with equal give and take. Reciprocity is essential to the success of a
relationship and you should never have to convince someone to love you as much as you love them.

Scenario 3 – After the Break Up



Your mind says, “I am going to be okay. In fact, before long, I’m going to feel like
myself.”

Your heart says, “The pain is excruciating, I don’t think I will ever feel at peace
again.”



After your break up, if you sit quietly and listen to your inner voice, you will hear hope
inside. This hope is telling you that you will feel better, that you will live life once again
with passion, and that you will experience love once again. The information you are being sent
from your mind  is based on your history and the fact that you have overcome obstacles in the
past. Your mind remembers the times where you have faced adversity and have come out on the
other side stronger and brighter. Your heart is speaking out of fear; listen to your mind – it
has a strong basis for giving you hope.

Listen to words from friends, family, and counselors even if they do not feel like they are
helping to heal your broken heart. Every single word helps. Listen to every word someone with
experience has to tell you. Up until now, we haven’t discussed the subconscious mind.
Positive messages to your subconscious mind can overpower negative ones from your heart.
Everything you are reading and listening to about healing is entering your subconscious and
will help you heal faster.

Above I have discussed the logical mind being overpowered by a somewhat illogical heart.
Please note, the situation can certainly occur in reverse. Your heart may experience genuine
love yet have seeds of doubt planted by an insecure mind. In either situation, if you are
looking to heal your heartache from your current break up, please know it is possible.
