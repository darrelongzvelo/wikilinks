Somerset is a county in the south-west of England . The county town is Taunton . The ceremonial
county of Somerset borders the counties of Bristol and Gloucestershire to the north,
Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east, and Devon to the south-west. It is also partly
bounded to the north and west by the coast of the Bristol Channel and the estuary of the River
Severn .

The traditional northern border of the county was the River Avon , but the administrative
boundary has crept southwards, with the creation and expansion of the City of Bristol . [1]

Somerset is a rural county of rolling hills such as the Mendip Hills , Quantock Hills and Exmoor
National Park , and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels . There is
evidence of occupation from Neolithic times, with subsequent Roman and Saxon occupation.
Later the county played a significant part in the English Civil War and Monmouth Rebellion .

Agriculture continues to be a major business in the county. Apple orchards were once
plentiful, and to this day Somerset is linked to the production of strong cider. Population
growth in the county is higher than the national average. Unemployment is lower than the
national average, and the largest employment sectors are retail, manufacturing,
leisure/tourism, and health/social care.

Toponymy

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The name derives from Old English SumorsÇ£te , which is short for SumortÅ«nsÇ£te ,
meaning "the people living at or dependent upon SumortÅ«n". [2] SumortÅ«n is modern
Somerton and may mean "summer settlement", a farmstead tended during the summer but not
occupied in winter. [3] However, Somerton is not down on the levels where only summer
occupation was possible because of flooding, but on a hill where winter occupation would have
been feasible. An alternative derivation is that the name came from Seo-mere-saetan meaning
"settlers by the sea lakes". [4]

The Old English name continues to be used in the motto of the county, Sumorsaete ealle , meaning
"all the people of Somerset". It was adopted in 1911, taken from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle .
Somerset was a part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex , and the reference is thought to
indicate the wholehearted support the people of Somerset gave to King Alfred in his struggle
to save Wessex from the Viking invaders. [5]

Somerset settlement names are mostly Anglo-Saxon in origin. A few hill names include Celtic
elements, for example a charter of 682 concerning Creechborough Hill defines it as "the hill
the British call Cructan and we call Crychbeorh ". A few modern names are Brythonic in origin,
such as Tarnock , while a few others have both Saxon and Brythonic elements such as Pen Hill . [6]

Human occupation

Edit



The Somerset Levels , and specifically the dry points such as Glastonbury and Brent Knoll ,
have a long history of settlement, and are known to have been settled by Mesolithic hunters.
[7] [8] Travel in the area was helped by the construction of the world's oldest known
engineered roadway, the Sweet Track . [9] The caves of the Mendip Hills were settled during the
Neolithic period and contain extensive archaeological sites such as those at Cheddar Gorge .
There are numerous Iron Age Hill Forts , some of which were later reused in the Dark Ages , such as
Cadbury Castle , [10] and Ham Hill . The age of the henge monument at Stanton Drew stone circles
is not known, but is believed to be Neolithic. [11]

On the authority of the future emperor Vespasian , the Second Legion Augusta invaded Somerset
from the southeast in AD 47. The county remained part of the Roman Empire until around
AD 409. [1] A variety of Roman remains have been found in the county including Pagans Hill
Roman Temple in Chew Stoke , [12] Low Ham Roman Villa and the Roman Baths which gave their name to
Bath . [13]

Somerset, like Dorset to the south, held the Saxon invasion back for over a century, remaining
a frontier between the Saxons and the Romano-British Celts. [14] After the Norman Conquest
the county was divided into 700 fiefs , and large areas were owned by the crown, [15] with
several fortifications such as Dunster Castle being used for control and defence.

Somerset contains HMP Shepton Mallet , England's oldest prison still in use, which opened in
1610. [16]

In the English Civil War Somerset was largely Parliamentarian . In 1685 the Monmouth
Rebellion was played out in Somerset and neighbouring Dorset. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis
and traveled north hoping to capture Bristol and Bath , but were defeated in the Battle of
Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland , the last battle fought on English soil. [17]

Arthur Wellesley took his title, Duke of Wellington from the town of Wellington . He is
commemorated on a nearby hill with a large, spotlit obelisk, known as the Wellington Monument
.

The 18th century was largely one of peace and declining industrial prosperity in Somerset.
The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelt the end for most of the
cottage industries of Somerset. However, farming continued to flourish, with the Bath and
West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and
Commerce being founded in 1777 to improve methods. Despite this, 20 years later John
Billingsley conducted a survey of the county's agriculture in 1795 and found that methods
could still be improved. [18]

Coal mining was an important industry in north Somerset during the 18th and 19th centuries,
and by 1800 it was based around Radstock . The Somerset Coal Canal was built in the early 19th
century to reduce the cost of transportation. The first 10 miles (16 km), running from a
junction with the Kennet and Avon Canal , along the Cam valley , to a terminal basin at Paulton ,
were in use by 1805, together with a number of tramways. A planned 7.25 mile (11.6 km) branch to
Midford was never built, but in 1815 a tramway was laid along its towing path. In 1871 the
tramway was purchased by the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway . [19] [20] The coalfields
reached their peak production by the 1920s, but have now all been closed, the last in 1973. [21]
Most of the surface buildings have been removed, and apart from a winding wheel outside
Radstock Museum, little visible evidence of their former existence remains.

The 19th century saw improvements to the roads of Somerset with the introduction of turnpikes
, and the building of canals and railways. 19th century canals included the Bridgwater and
Taunton Canal , Westport Canal , Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal . [7] The Dorset and
Somerset Canal was proposed, but very little of it was ever constructed.
File:Westsom.rail.80136.750pix.jpg The usefulness of the canals was short lived, though
some have now been restored for recreation. The 19th century also saw the construction of
railways to and through Somerset. The county was served by three pre-1923 Grouping railway
companies: the Great Western Railway (GWR), the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&DJR)
and the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR). The former main lines of the GWR are still in
use today, although many of its branch lines were scrapped. The former lines of the Somerset
and Dorset Joint Railway closed completely; however, the L&SWR survived as a part of the
present West of England Main Line . None of these lines, in Somerset, are electrified . Three
branch lines: the West and East Somerset Railways and the Gartell Light Railway were rescued
and transferred back to private ownership as "heritage" lines.

The population of Somerset has continued to grow since 1800, particularly in the seaside
towns, notably Weston-super-Mare . Some population decline in the villages occurred
earlier in the period, but this has now been reversed.

During the First World War many Somerset soldiers were killed, and war memorials were put up in
most of the county's towns and villages. Only a few villages escaped casualties. In the Second
World War there were also casualties, though much fewer; their names were added to the
memorials. During the Second World War the county was a base for troops preparing for the D-Day
landings , and some hospitals still date partly from that time. The Taunton Stop Line was set up
to repel a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen along
the coast. A decoy town was constructed on Black Down , on the flight path to Bristol. It was
intended to mimic the blazing lights of Bristol at night, after it had been bombed. The decoy
was fitted with dim lights, and after the first wave of night bombers had passed over, drums of
oil were ignited to simulate the effects of a blazing city or harbour, with the aim of fooling
subsequent waves of bombers to drop their bombs on the wrong location. [22]

For long distance holiday traffic travelling through the county to and from Devon and
Cornwall, Somerset is often regarded as a marker on the journey. North-south traffic moves
though the county via the M5 Motorway . Traffic to and from the east can either travel via the
A303 road , or via the M4 Motorway , which runs east-west, crossing the M5 just beyond the
northern limits of the county.

Geology, landscape and ecology

Main article: Geology of Somerset

File:Uk som brue.jpg Much of the landscape of Somerset falls into types determined by the
underlying geology . These landscapes are the limestone karst and lias of the north, the clay
vales and wetlands of the centre, the oolites of the east and south, and the Devonian sandstone
of the west. [23] To the north east of the Somerset Levels , the Mendip Hills are moderately high
limestone hills. There is an extensive network of caves , including Wookey Hole , underground
rivers, and a number of gorges , including Cheddar Gorge and Ebbor Gorge . [24] Seventy-six
square miles (197 kmÂ² ) of the central and western Mendip Hills was designated an Area of
Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1972. The main habitat on these hills is calcareous grassland ,
with some arable agriculture. The Somerset coalfield is part of a larger coalfield which
stretches into Gloucestershire . To the north of the Mendip hills is the Chew Valley and to the
south, on the clay substrate, are a number of broad valleys which support dairy farming and
drain into the Somerset Levels.

The Somerset Levels (or Somerset Levels and Moors as they are less commonly, but more
correctly, called) is a sparsely populated wetland area of central Somerset, between the
Quantock and Mendip hills. They consist of marine clay levels along the coast, and the inland
(often peat based) moors. The Levels are divided into two by the Polden Hills , with the
catchment areas of the River Parrett and Axe - Brue on either side. The total area of the levels
amounts to approximately 160,000  acres (650  km 2 ) [25] and broadly corresponds to the
administrative district of Sedgemoor but also includes the south west of Mendip district.
Approximately 70% of the area is grassland and 30% is arable. [25] This expanse of flat land,
stretching up to 20 miles (32 km) inland, is not very much higher than sea level. Before it
was drained, much of the land was under a shallow brackish sea in winter and was a marsh in
summer. Drainage started in Roman times, and was restarted various times: in the Saxon
period; in the Middle Ages by the Glastonbury Abbey , from 1400–1770; and during the Second
World War, with the construction of the Huntspill River . Pumping and management of water
levels still continues. [26]

The North Somerset Levels basin, north of the Mendips, covers a smaller geographical area
than the Somerset Levels; and forms a coastal area around Avonmouth . It too was reclaimed by
draining. [26] [27] It is mirrored, across the Severn Estuary , in Wales, by a similar
low-lying area: the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels . [27]

In the far west of the county, running into Devon, is Exmoor , a high Devonian sandstone moor ,
which was designated as a national park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the
Countryside Act . [28] The highest point in Somerset is Dunkery Beacon on Exmoor, with an
altitude of 1,704 feet (519 m). Over 100 sites in Somerset have been designated as Sites of
Special Scientific Interest . File:Brean Down.jpg Brean Down from Steep Holm

The 40-mile (64 km) coastline of the Bristol Channel and Severn estuary forms part of the
northern border of Somerset. [29] The Bristol Channel has the second largest tidal range in
the world. At Burnham-on-Sea , for example, the tidal range of a spring tide is over 39  feet
(12  m ). [30] [31] Proposals for the construction of a Severn Barrage aim to harness this
energy. The main coastal towns are, from the west to the north east, Minehead , Watchet ,
Burnham-on-Sea , Weston-super-Mare , Clevedon and Portishead . The coastal area between
Minehead and the eastern extreme of the administrative countyâ€™s coastline at Brean
Down is known as Bridgwater Bay , and is a National Nature Reserve . [32] North of that, the coast
forms Weston Bay and Sand Bay whose northern tip, Sand Point , marks the lower limit of the
Severn Estuary. [33]

In the mid and north of the county the coastline is low as the level wetlands of the levels meet
the sea. In the west, the coastline is high and dramatic where the plateau of Exmoor meets the
sea, with high cliffs and waterfalls. [32] At an altitude of 397 feet (121 m), Chard is the
highest town in Somerset and also the southernmost.

The county has many rivers, including the Axe , Brue , Cary , Parrett , Sheppey, Tone and Yeo .
These both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of mid and west Somerset. [32] In the north of
the county the River Chew flows into the Bristol Avon .

File:SnowyExmoor.jpg Along with the rest of South West England , Somerset has a temperate
climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean
temperature is approximately 10  Â°C (50.0  Â°F ) and shows a seasonal and a diurnal
variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts
of the UK. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 Â°C
(33.8 Â°F) and 2 Â°C (35.6 Â°F). July and August are the warmest months in the
region with mean daily maxima around 21 Â°C (69.8 Â°F).

The south-west of England has a favoured location with respect to the Azores high pressure
when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer.
Convective cloud often forms inland however, especially near hills, reducing the number of
hours of sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours.

Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. The Atlantic
depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those
seasons in the south-west is from this source. Average rainfall is around 31  inches (787 
mm )–35 inches (889 mm). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March
have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The
predominant wind direction is from the south-west. [34] Yeovilton Climate: Average maximum

Main article: Economy of Somerset

File:Somerset.dunster.arp.750pix.jpg Somerset has few industrial centres. Bridgwater
was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the West Country's leading port. The River
Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. By then loading the cargoes onto
smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, they could be carried further
up river to Langport . [35] The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf.
Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay
roof tiles , and later cellophane , but those industries have now closed. With its good links to
the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as
Argos , Toolstation and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufacture helicopters in Yeovil ,
and Normalair Garratt , who build aircraft oxygen systems, are also based in the town. Many
towns have encouraged small-scale light industries , such as Crewkerne 's Ariel Motor
Company , one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.

Somerset was, and is, an important supplier of equipment and technology to support the
defence of United Kingdom. A Royal Ordnance Factory , ROF Bridgwater was built at the start of
the Second World War , between the villages of Puriton and Woolavington , to manufacture
explosives; and in 2007 is still operating, at a much reduced output, as part of BAE Systems
Land Systems and is due to close completely in 2008. Templecombe has Thales Underwater
Systems ; and Taunton presently has the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and Avimo, which
became part of Thales Optics. It has been announced twice, in 2006 and 2007, that
manufacturing is to end at Thales Optics' Taunton site, [36] but the Trade Unions and Taunton
Deane District Council are working to reverse or mitigate these decisions. Bath has Ministry
of Defence offices; and Norton Fitzwarren is the home of 40 Commando . Other high-technology
companies include the optics company Gooch and Housego, at Ilminster .

Agriculture and food and drink production continue to be major industries in the county,
employing over 15,000 people. Apple orchards were once plentiful, and Somerset is still a
major producer of cider . The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet are involved with the
production of cider, especially Blackthorn Cider , which is sold nationwide, and there are
specialist producers such as Burrow Hill Cider Farm and Thatchers Cider . Gerber Products
Company in Bridgwater are the largest producer of fruit juices in Europe , producing brands
such as ' Sunny Delight ' and 'Ocean Spray'. Development of the milk-based industries, such as
Yeo Valley Organic , has resulted in the production of ranges of desserts, yoghurts and
cheeses, [37] including Cheddar cheese – some of which has the West Country Farmhouse
Cheddar PDO .

Towns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew around the medieval weaving industry. Street
developed as a centre for the production of woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes , with
C&J Clark establishing its headquarters in the town. C&J Clark's shoes are no longer
manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower-wage areas, such as China and Asia .
[38] Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village ,
the first purpose built factory outlet in the UK . C&J Clark also had shoe factories, at one time
at Bridgwater and Minehead , to provide employment outside of the main summer tourist season,
but these satellite sites had been were closed, in the late 1980s, before the main site at
Street. Dr. Martens shoes were also made in Somerset, by the Northampton-based R. Griggs
Group, using redundant skilled shoemakers from C&J Clark; this work has also been
transferred to Asia.

The county has a long tradition of supplying freestone and building stone . Quarries at
Doulting supplied to freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral . Bath stone is
also widely used. Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century, but it was used long
before then. It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines , and as a result
of cutting the Box Tunnel , at various locations in Wiltshire , including Box . [39] [40] [41]
Bath stone is still used today, on a reduced scale; but more often as a cladding , rather than a
structural material. [39] Further south, Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from
Ham Hill , which is also widely used in the construction industry. Blue Lias has been used
locally as a building stone; and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement . Puriton
up to the 1960s had Blue Lias stone quarries, as did several other Polden Villages . Its
quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball , adjacent to the King's Sedgemoor Drain .
Its derelict, early 20th century, remains were removed when the M5 motorway was constructed
in the mid-1970s. [42] Since the 1920s, the county has supplied aggregates . Foster Yeoman is
Europe's large supplier of limestone aggregates, with quarries at Merehead Quarry . It has a
dedicated railway operation, Mendip Rail , which is used to transport aggregates by rail from
a group of Mendip quarries .

Much of the county is scenic and unspoilt. Tourism is a major industry, estimated in 2001 to
support around 23,000 people. [43] Attractions include the coastal towns, part of the Exmoor
National Park , the West Somerset Railway (a heritage railway ), and the museum of the Fleet Air
Arm at RNAS Yeovilton . The town of Glastonbury has mythical associations, and an annual
open-air rock festival (actually in Pilton ), while the Cheddar Gorge has show caves open to
visitors, as well as its locally produced cheese, although there is now only one cheese maker
remaining in the village of Cheddar . Regional gross value added by the non-metropolitan
county of Somerset at current basic prices. Figures are in millions of British pounds
sterling. [44] Year Regional Gross Value Added [A] Agriculture [B] Industry [C] Services [D]

Edit



The population in 1901 was 508,256. [15] In the 2001 census the population of the Somerset
County Council area was 498,093 [45] with 169,040 in Bath and North East Somerset , [46] and
188,564 in North Somerset [47] giving a total for the historic county of 855,697. This was
estimated to have risen to 895,700 in 2006. [48]

The Somerset County Council area is one of the fastest growing regions in the United Kingdom.
Population growth is higher than the national average, with a 6.4% increase since 1991, and a
17% increase since 1981. The population density is 1.4 persons per hectare , which can be
compared to 2.07 persons per hectare for the South West region . Within the county, population
density ranges 0.5 in West Somerset to 2.2 persons per hectare in Taunton Deane . The
percentage of the population who are economically active is higher than the regional and
national average, and the unemployment rate is lower than the regional and national average.
[49]

The black minority ethnic population of the total population is 2.9% in Somerset. Chinese is
the highest ethnic population and whilst there is no official recording, it is believed that
Romany Gypsies are a significant ethnic minority. [29] Over 25% of Somerset's population is
concentrated in Taunton, Bridgwater and Yeovil. The rest of the county is rural and sparsely
populated. Over 9 million tourist nights are spent in Somerset each year, which
significantly increases the population at peak times. [29]

Edit



File:WestonTownHall.jpg The county is divided into nine constituencies for the election of
Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons . The constituencies of Bridgwater , Wells
, Weston-super-Mare and Woodspring currently elect Conservative MPs, while Bath , Somerton
and Frome , Taunton and Yeovil currently return Liberal Democrats . Only Wansdyke , which will
become North East Somerset at the next election, returns a Labour politician. Residents of
Somerset also form part of the electorate for the South West England constituency for
elections to the European Parliament .

The ceremonial county of Somerset consists of a non-metropolitan county and two unitary
authorities . The districts of Somerset are West Somerset , South Somerset , Taunton Deane ,
Mendip and Sedgemoor . The two administratively independent unitary authorities, which
were established on 1 April 1996 following the break up of the county of Avon , are North
Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset . These unitary authorities include areas that were
once part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.

The Department for Communities and Local Government was considering a proposal by Somerset
County Council to change Somerset's administrative structure by abolishing the five
districts to create a Somerset unitary authority. The changes were planned to be implemented
no later than 1 April 2009 . [50] [51] However, support for the county council's bid was not
guaranteed and opposition among the district council and local population was strong, with
82% of people responding to a referendum organized by the five district councils rejecting
the proposals. [52] It was confirmed in July 2007 that the government had rejected the
proposals for unitary authorities in Somerset, and that the present two-tier arrangements
of Somerset County Council and the district councils will remain. [53]

Wells Cathedral

Somerset has traditions of art, music and literature. Wordsworth and Coleridge wrote while
staying in Coleridge Cottage , Nether Stowey . [54] The writer Evelyn Waugh spent his last
years in the village of Combe Florey . [55] Traditional folk music, both song and dance, was
important in the agricultural communities. Somerset songs were collected by Cecil Sharp and
incorporated into a number of works including Holst's A Somerset Rhapsody . Halsway Manor
near Williton is an international centre for folk music. The tradition continues today with
groups such as The Wurzels , specialising in Scrumpy and Western music. [56]

The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts takes place most years in Pilton ,
near Shepton Mallet , attracting over 170,000 music and culture lovers from around the world,
and world-famous entertainers. [57] The Big Green Gathering which grew out of the Green
fields at the Glastonbury Festival is held in the Mendip Hills between Charterhouse and
Compton Martin each summer. [58] The annual Bath Literature Festival is one of several local
festivals in the county which include the Frome Festival and the Trowbridge Village Pump
Festival , which, despite its name, is held at Farleigh Hungerford in Somerset. The annual
circuit of West Country Carnivals is held in a variety of Somerset towns during the autumn,
forming a major regional festival, and the largest Festival of Lights in Europe. [59]

File:Glastonbury Tor.jpg In Arthurian legend , Avalon had became associated with
Glastonbury Tor , when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of King
Arthur and his queen. [60] What is more certain is that Glastonbury was an important religious
centre by 700 and claims to be "the oldest above-ground Christian church in the World" [61]
situated "in the mystical land of Avalon" by dating the founding of the community of monks at AD
63, the legendary visit of Joseph of Arimathea , who was supposed to have brought the Holy Grail
. [61] During the Middle Ages there were also important religious sites at Woodspring Priory
and Muchelney Abbey . The present Diocese of Bath and Wells covers Somerset and a small area of
Dorset. The Episcopal seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells is now located in the Cathedral
Church of Saint Andrew in the city of Wells , having been previously based at Bath Abbey . Before
the English Reformation , it was a Roman Catholic diocese. There is also a Benedictine
monastery Saint Gregory's Abbey, commonly known as Downside Abbey at
Stratton-on-the-Fosse , and the Cistercian Cleeve Abbey near the village of Washford .
File:Tyntesfield 1.jpg There are several museums in the county including several in Bath
including; the American Museum in Britain , the Building of Bath Museum , the Herschel Museum
of Astronomy , the Jane Austen Centre , and the Roman Baths . Several other visitor attractions
reflect the cultural heritage of the county including; Claverton Pumping Station , Dunster
Working Watermill , the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, Nunney Castle , The Helicopter
Museum in Weston super Mare, King John's Hunting Lodge in Axbridge , Radstock Museum ,
Somerset County Museum in Taunton, the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury, and
Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum .

Somerset has 11,500 listed buildings , 523 Scheduled Monuments , 192 conservation areas , 41
parks and gardens including those at Barrington Court , Holnicote Estate , Prior Park
Landscape Garden and Tintinhull Garden , 36 English Heritage sites and 19 National Trust
sites including Clevedon Court , Fyne Court , Montacute House and Tyntesfield as well as
Stembridge Tower Mill the last remaining thatched windmill in England. [1] Other historic
houses in the county which have remained in private ownership or used for other purposes
include Halswell House and Marston Bigot .

Bath Rugby play at the Recreation Ground in Bath, while the Somerset County Cricket Club are
based at the County Ground in Taunton. The country gained its first Football League club in
2003 when Yeovil Town won promotion to Division Three as Football Conference champions. They
had achieved numerous FA Cup giant-killing victories over Football League sides in the past
50 years, and since joining the elite they have won promotion again - as League Two champions in
2005 . They came close to yet another promotion in 2007 when they reached the League One playoff
final, but lost to Blackpool at the recently re-opened Wembley Stadium . Horse racing courses
are at Taunton and Wincanton .

In addition to English national newspapers the county is served by the regional Western Daily
Press and local newspapers including; the Bath Chronicle , Chew Valley Gazette , Clevedon
Mercury and the Mendip Times . Television and radio are provided by BBC Somerset , GWR FM
Bristol and HTV (now known as ITV Wales & West Ltd).

File:Pulteney Bridge.jpg The original county town of Somerset was Somerton , but in recent
years that role has been transferred to Taunton.

Somerset has 4,058 miles (6,531 km) of roads. The main arterial routes, which include the
M5 motorway , A303 , A37 , A38 and A39 , give fairly good access across the county, but many areas
can only be accessed via narrow lanes. [29] Rail services are provided by the West of England
Main Line through Yeovil, the Bristol to Taunton Line and the Reading to Plymouth Line .
Bristol International Airport provides national and international air services.

The county has two cities, Bath and Wells, and only a small number of towns. In many cases there
are villages which are larger than their neighbouring towns; the village of Cheddar, for
example, has three times the population of the nearby town of Axbridge . Many of the
settlements developed because of their strategic importance in relation to geographical
features such as river crossings or valleys in ranges of hills. Examples include Axbridge on
the River Axe , Castle Cary on the River Cary , North Petherton on the River Parrett , and
Ilminster , where there was a crossing point on the River Isle . Midsomer Norton lies on the
River Somer ; while the Wellow Brook and the Fosseway Roman road run through Radstock. Note:
Norton Radstock is the name of a conurbation consisting of Midsomer Norton and Radstock.

Education

Edit



State schools in Somerset are provided by three Local Education Authorities : Bath and North
East Somerset, North Somerset – both of them unitary authorities – and the larger
Somerset County Council. In some areas primary , infant and junior schools cater for ages four
to eleven, after which the pupils move on to secondary schools . In other areas there is a
three-tier system of first , middle and upper schools. [62]

Some of the county's secondary schools have specialist school status. Some schools have
sixth forms and others transfer their sixth formers to colleges. Several schools can trace
their origins back many years, such as The Blue School in Wells, Richard Huish College in
Taunton and Oldfield School in Bath. Others have changed their names over the years such as
Beechen Cliff School which was started in 1905 as the City of Bath Boys' School and changed to
its present name in 1972 when the grammar school was amalgamated with a local secondary modern
school , to form a comprehensive school . Others such as Backwell School , Chew Valley School ,
Churchill Community School , Hayesfield School Technology College , The Kings of Wessex
School , Nailsea School , Wellsway School and Gordano School have been established and built
since the Second World War.

Sexey's School is a state boarding school in Bruton that also takes some day pupils from the
surrounding area. The Somerset LEA also provides a number of special schools such as Farleigh
College , which caters for children aged between ten and seventeen with special educational
needs . Provision for pupils with special educational needs is also made within the
mainstream schools.

There is also a range of independent or public schools . Many of these are for pupils between 11
and 18 years such as King's College, Taunton and Taunton School . King's School was founded in
1519 and received royal foundation status around 30 years later in the reign of Edward VI .
Millfield is the largest co-educational boarding school, and the largest co-educational
independent school in the country, catering for 1,260 pupils, of which 910 are boarders. [63]
There are also preparatory schools for younger children, such as All Hallows , and Hazlegrove
Preparatory School . Other schools provide education for children from the age of 3 or 4 years
through to 18 such as King Edward's School , Queen's College and Wells Cathedral School which
is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in Britain . Some of
these schools have religious affiliations, such as Monkton Combe School , Prior Park College
, Sidcot School which is associated with the Religious Society of Friends , Downside School
which is a Roman Catholic public school in Stratton-on-the-Fosse , situated next to the
Benedictine Downside Abbey , and Kingswood School , which was founded by John Wesley in 1748 in
Kingswood near Bristol, originally for the education of the sons of the itinerant ministers
(clergy) of the Methodist Church .

A wide range of adult education and further education courses is available in Somerset, in
schools, colleges and other community venues. The colleges include; Bridgwater College ,
Frome Community College , Richard Huish College , Somerset College of Arts and Technology ,
Strode College and Yeovil College

Bath University and Bath Spa University are higher education establishments in the
north-east corner of the county.
