Did you get a chance to sail to Alaska this summer?</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            Sure did:\n            <a href="../alaska2008/index.html" shape="rect">Alaska 2008</a>\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">\n            I\'m writing to ask a question that I personally already have an answer for, but I still could use a little insight. Awhile back I wrote to you asking if it would be possible to apply essentially the same argument you made against Psychology to another obscure social science like Media Theory. You never wrote back, so I imagined the question either annoyed you, or you were just too busy to respond.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_reply">It\'s just that I get quite a lot of inquiries on that topic, and I can\'t answer all of them. I think the answer is obvious, but I\'ll explain further below.</span>\n          <span class="message_query">\n            Anyhow, I decided for myself, based on a review of several sociology textbooks, and more recently, my mass media theory textbooks that virtually all social research has such severe experimental limitations and can\'t be trusted. But I may have overstepped. For some reason, none of the professors agree with me that limited predictability equals limited reliability.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            Most likely the professors are not scientists and do not understand basic science. They may not care that basic scientific standards cannot be met. They may be arguing that science doesn\'t matter, or something else. But they cannot argue that an untestable, unfalsifiable theory represents science in anything but name.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">\n            I made this assertion in class, and it fell short with the other students and the Professor. I tried to argue that these theories are lacking predictability, or as I see it, they cannot convincingly claim that media have more negative than positive effects on society and vice verse. This is not to say that the media doesn\'t have an effect good or bad, just that the science doesn\'t hold enough weight either way.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            As to science, it\'s not basically a matter of predictability, that is more a symptom than a fundamental issue. A theory that lacks sufficient scientific properties might lack predictability, but that isn\'t the determining factor that separates scientific theories from other kinds.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            The primary property that identifies scientific theories is\n            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability" shape="rect">\n              <i>falsifiability</i>\n            </a>\n            . If a scientific theory is put forth, it must make testable predictions. The tests must be practical, and if they fail, the theory must be discarded. If any element in this sequence is not present or practical, the theory is not part of science.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            In media studies, people like to hold political discussions that have a superficial resemblance to scientific debates.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            Let\'s say that a particularly violent TV program is followed by a gruesome murder. Someone says the program caused the murder. How can we establish this in a scientific way?\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            Well, we can\'t, for several reasons. One reason is there is just one data point, and one data point is never enough for science (except in the special case of an immediate falsification \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called &quot;black swan&quot; case).\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            To establish a positive correlation between a cause A and an effect B, we need several things that are almost never part of media studies. Among those things are:\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n          </span>\n          <ol>\n            <li>A control group.</li>\n            <li>An unambiguous test case that guards against hidden assumptions.</li>\n            <li>A prospective, not a retrospective, experimental design.</li>\n          </ol>\n          This is just the barest outline. Real-world media cannot ever be used for serious scientific work because it fails all three criteria.\n          <span class="message_query">\n            Much of my thinking on this topic stems from the fact that my great aunt and uncle were murdered by my cousin. His father was killed in a car accident when he was 8, and he never got the necessary help he needed to recover and grow. I knew him as a fun loving ten-year-old, and he was not insane then. But because of some little understood reasons, he became psychotic by age 20. He was given three separate diagnoses by different psychologists.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            That by itself would have made me psychotic. Oh, sorry, I guess this isn\'t very funny from your perspective.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            You need to realize that psychology is a collection of opinions, not diagnoses. Psychology is closer to astrology than it is to oncology, with the complication that psychologists are sometimes confused with scientists in courts of law, and people sometimes lose their freedom based on psychologists\' opinions.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">All of which were considered to be personal illnesses that were not dangerous to others. He was diagnosed as manic depressive, then schizophrenic, then schizo-affective \xe2\x80\x94 whatever the heck that means.</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            Schizophrenic means you\'re crazy. Schizo-affective means you\n            <i>feel</i>\n            crazy. Some people feel crazy but aren\'t, while others ... oh, I\'m sure you get it, four possibilities altogether:\n          </span>\n          <ol>\n            <li>Doesn\'t feel crazy, isn\'t crazy.</li>\n            <li>Feels crazy, but isn\'t crazy.</li>\n            <li>Doesn\'t feel crazy, but is crazy.</li>\n            <li>Feels crazy, is crazy.</li>\n          </ol>\n          And anyone who believes what psychologists say needs to have his head examined.\n          <span class="message_query">I might be making a big leap here, but because of the number of contradictory theories in media science, I\'m now wondering what good media research is to the general public.</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            Without strict experimental controls, media research ends up being a playground for anyone\'s pet theory, and nothing is resolved in a reliable, systematic way. This happens to be the present state of the field.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            Media studies is a very highly politicized field, and even if it were much more scientific than it is, because of all the special interests with a stake in the outcome, it would still be a minefield in which to try to conduct serious research.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            One side of the most common media issue (portrayals of violence) might say:\n          </span>\n          <ol>\n            <li>Violence in the media harms young, impressionable minds, and even though this can\'t really be demonstrated scientifically, &quot;everyone knows it\'s true&quot;.</li>\n            <li>Society has a responsibility to guard the welfare of the young and innocent, thus the state has a mandate to act with respect to this issue. State regulation is both appropriate and necessary.</li>\n          </ol>\n          The other side might say:\n          <ol>\n            <li>People must accept responsibility for personal actions. They should not be allowed to blame others for personal choices and/or crimes, and to try to blame the media is to throw open the door to declaring everyone a victim and absolving people of anything resembling personal responsibility.</li>\n            <li>\n              To try to control the media is to meddle in very basic constitutional issues, dabble in censorship, and if such a program were to begin, it would only drive certain kinds of media portrayals underground, where they might thrive in a more insidious and dangerous form (as in the example of illegal drugs).\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n          I think you will see that both these positions have merit. Like any public issue worth discussing, this one has at least two legitimate sides.\n          <span class="message_query">I chose to study the media partly because I\'m generally intrigued and somewhat frightened by what people with political motivations believe</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">As you get older, you will probably mellow with regard to what positions people take on public issues. There\'s nothing like experience and seasoning to help you see why people say the things they do.</span>\n          <span class="message_query">(I\'m also terrible at Mathematics).</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            Now that is a shame. If I were you, I would do my best to acquire those kinds of skills. Given your present interests, knowing how mathematics works could save you a lot of heartache while trying to sort out the very issues we\'re discussing. To begin with, you would discover how an experiment can be designed to appear to support a view that it cannot actually support.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">\n            I\'m just starting to work in the broadcast field, but also have a little training in marketing, advertising, and public relations strategies and tactics. The only thing I\'ve figured out is that communicators don\'t necessarily know why people respond to media tactics but they know how to push emotional buttons, and some media people do so usually for sake of profit or propaganda. I see media theory as a very dangerous &quot;science&quot; as it is currently pursued. In other words, we can push a bunch of buttons, but we don\'t quite know what will happen.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_reply">Actually, old hands in the field know what will happen. Propaganda is hardly a scientific undertaking, but there are some broad, general principles that can be relied on to effect public opinion in particular ways.</span>\n        </div>\n        <a name="Reliability_of_Evidence_II" shape="rect"></a>\n        <span class="article_subtopic">Reliability of Evidence II</span>\n        <div class="expco">\n          <span class="message_query">\n            Thanks for your earlier reply. I recently read\n            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Impact-Highly-Improbable/dp/1400063515" shape="rect">The Black Swan, The Impact of the Highly Improbable by Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>\n            .\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_reply">I recently read this book also.</span>\n          <span class="message_query">He argues, to my understanding, that Fractals are a superior form of mathematics for identifying Black Swans.</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            The problem with Taleb\'s thesis is that Black Swans are unpredictable\n            <i>by definition</i>\n            . That is what makes them &quot;outliers,&quot; to use his term. As he defines them, Black Swans lie outside any model \xe2\x80\x94 their appearance in a presumably controlled system like state economic policy only proves they are Black Swans, nothing else. If you create a mathematical model that takes yesterday\'s Black Swan into account, tomorrow\'s Black Swan will pop up in a place outside the new model\'s purview. Otherwise, it isn\'t really a Black Swan, is it?\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            Also, fractals are a very fashionable topic right now. I would want to see an example where a fractal approach produced a reliable\n            <i>predictive</i>\n            model of real-world phenomena in a way that sheds more light than heat. At the moment, fractals are more a plaything than a tool, and are more often used to model an existing data set than make a prediction.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            There is an essential contradiction in claiming that Black Swans exist, defining them as Taleb does, and then expecting to be able to forecast their appearance. In fairness, he doesn\'t do this in an overt way, he only hints at it.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">He takes a harsh tone against scientists who rely heavily on Gaussian Statistics in developing mainly economic theory.</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            There\'s plenty of truth in that position. It is well-established that bell curves are often misused, so this is perhaps not quite so original as he makes it seem.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            Students of statistics are cautioned that a straight bell-curve analysis can often be a waste of time and can lead to a false sense of security.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">He points to the stock market crash of 1984, as evidence of the Gaussian Curve\'s shortcoming. He uses many other examples as well, but you\'ve probably read at least one of his books already.</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            Yes, one can always point to a real-world event to show that a conventional statistical analysis failed to predict something. Remember Einstein\'s remark, &quot;As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.&quot;\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            As to the 1987 (not 1984) stock market crash, it\'s important to understand that the behavior of free markets is not predictable even in principle \xe2\x80\x94 a large number of independent conscious entities are trying to maximize their gain, propelled by logic, strategy or emotion. Predicting a free market is identical to trying to analyze our brains while using our brains as the research instrument. This is a classic problem where, due to self-reference,\n            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" shape="rect">G\xc3\xb6del\'s Incompleteness Theorems</a>\n            place strict limits on what can be predicted.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">I\'m guessing that you would agree, partly, that Gaussian statistics cannot be used properly in any social science, let alone economic theory.</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            I would not say &quot;any.&quot; That goes too far. If we\'re predicting the outcome of a series of coin tosses or a similar activity, a straight Gaussian approach is quite reliable. There are many real-world problems that can be reduced to a pile of fairly tossed coins, but the stock market isn\'t one of them.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">My main questions are: 1.) Are these problems with Gaussian statistics more a result of the people using them and the context in which they are using them?</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">That\'s the problem \xe2\x80\x94 a Gaussian analysis is very easy to apply, so it gets applied to a data set for which it is inappropriate. This problem is emphasized in any worthwhile statistics course.</span>\n          <span class="message_query">2.) Do you agree with Taleb that Mandelbrotian fractals are a useful alternative for developing social scientific theory, or at least predicting Black Swans?</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            No. And he didn\'t give any examples for a reason \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s very difficult to meaningfully correlate a fractal with a real-world data set.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            In fairness, the other reason there aren\'t any examples is that books meant for a popular readership tend not to have any technical detail, and equations are aggressively removed by editors. Supposedly there\'s a rule in publishing that each additional equation cuts your readership in half. I was going to include a simple equation that shows this relationship, but I don\'t want to cut\n            <i>my</i>\n            readership in half.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            And further, with respect to predicting a free market, if a particular model\'s existence becomes known, its effectiveness is immediately destroyed.

That in turn implies that the religion exists only in the minds of its followers.

Proselytizing only exposes the insecurity of religious believers and the low value of religious thought.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            Things of real value don\'t need to be proclaimed on street corners, indeed for something of value the relationship between seller and buyer is reversed, with the buyer actively pursuing the seller.

His treatment of the subject isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t as extensive as yours, likely because it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not his main topic, but he makes the same precise arguments.

Another is an insecure parent who wants the diagnosis because it absolves the parent of any responsibility (because like any illness, mental illness is no one\'s fault).

One solution to these two factors is to label the children with the name of an illness that simultaneously frees the parents from any personal responsibility and creates a bit of drama in otherwise boring lives. To put it simply, if Asperger\'s didn\'t exist, parents would invent it.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            In the 1950s, the bogus danger (the source of drama) was that kids would become juvenile delinquents (perfectly pictured by\n            <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/wild.html" shape="rect">Marlon Brando in &quot;The Wild One&quot;</a>\n            ). In the 1960s the danger was that they would become war protesters or hippies (or hippie war protesters).

I suspect that, once this issue is sorted out, Asperger\'s will turn out to be a genetic condition that has been around for hundreds of years, but that hasn\'t been identified until recently, only because of improvements in medical technology.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            I also think that identifying it has had an overall negative effect so far, because it\'s being described without being explained. Until there is an explanation, certain people will exploit the unknowns to their advantage \xe2\x80\x94 psychologists, neurologists, and of course, parents.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll bet he would also agree with your thoughts about institutional education. You both probably agree that a diploma or degree is used to define social status today now more than ever in American History?</span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            Yes, in fact it seems to be the American replacement for a class-stratified society such as was true in England 100 years ago. It seems we\'ve taken a strong position in this country against a class-conscious society, only to see a new one spring into existence from the ashes of the old.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">\n            When I relate these ideas to my personal experience with school, I can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t help but think back to my elementary school years when I started to get bored in the classroom and began to fail every class. My teachers would warn me that in order to succeed in life, I needed a college degree or else I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d end up working at McDonald\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s my whole life.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <i>[ a lengthy personal history is deleted here because it could be used to identify my correspondent ]</i>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            My point is that clearly the fear won me over. I never had a shot at the better paying jobs because I didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t have that piece of paper called a credential. I wasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t disciplined enough to self-study and become one of those great American success stories like you, Paul Harvey, Larry King etc. Conversely, I fully understand how true intelligence speaks for itself\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbdsmart is as smart does.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd I know that if I were as focused and disciplined and original as say you for example, I could earn a spot on a NASA engineering project, write a pioneering word processing program and sell my ideas to executives at a burgeoning computer firm. My specific downfall is that I allowed a sort of self-imposed failure to take hold and I simply bought-in to the fear mindset conventionally sold to idea consumers. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not trying to be hard on myself so much as I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m trying to be brutally honest.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            At this point I want to warn you against creating a false dichotomy in which you revere examples of successful people and contrast yourself negatively. This is a bad idea \xe2\x80\x94 it pretends there are magic people, people whose success is beyond comprehension, but this kind of thinking can become a trap. It can prevent you from doing your best with your skills.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            All the successful people you listed, myself included, are just people. Some worked very hard and focused on particular objectives, and some were just lucky. On average, successful people can and will credit their success to a mixture of dedication and luck. But we\'re not a race apart.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_query">\n            You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re a cool guy Mr. Lutus.

No other Author I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m aware of has had that ability to make material as personally relevant for the reader as you. If I hadn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t stumbled upon your website and articles some time ago, I wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be nearly as capable of finding my way out of the forest as I am now.\n          </span>\n          <span class="message_reply">\n            Thanks, but I must tell you people like me produce at least as many negative reactions as positive ones. My article\n            <a href="../psychology/aspergers.php" shape="rect">&quot;Asperger\'s by Proxy&quot;</a>\n            describes a woman who tried to turn me into a narcissistic enabler, but once she saw this wasn\'t going to happen, she set out to destroy me (and this way of saying it isn\'t even slightly exaggerated). Eventually it came to me that she recognized only two categories of people \xe2\x80\x94 acolytes and victims. I discovered it wasn\'t possible to be neutral, and I should have left much sooner than I did. I stayed too long mostly out of compassion for another of her victims (her son).\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            All I am saying is that distinctive people (people who stand out in a crowd) tend to be targeted by the world\'s reformers, the shallow kind of person for whom there is precisely one acceptable set of values \xe2\x80\x94 theirs. They try to reform you, then they try to destroy you. Some of them are religious, some political, but all of them are incredibly annoying.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            I remember a conversation from twenty years ago, one that made me aware I wasn\'t ever going to be a cog in a great machine. At a university where I served as a technical consultant, I had a talk with a rather conventional man who had just gotten married. He said, &quot;Are you ever going to get married?&quot; I expressed doubt. He reacted in a way I\'ll never forget \xe2\x80\x94 he said, &quot;When are you going to start living up to your responsibilities?&quot;\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            Sometimes a person expresses his unadorned world view, unfiltered by self-consciousness or personal reserve, and I was privileged to be present for it. I realized I was speaking to a true proletarian, someone for whom the reproductive function was the central issue of his life, and against which there were no competing priorities. I might add, based on many such conversations since then, that it\'s a surprisingly common state of mind.\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            <br clear="none"></br>\n            Don\'t get the wrong idea here \xe2\x80\x94 these people are the salt of the earth, the majority, utterly reliable and predictable. They have everything but ideas, which means there\'s a place for someone like me. My responsibility is to have ideas rather than children. I may succeed, I may fail, but what I can\'t do is claim that my offspring have Asperger\'s.\n          </span>\n        </div>\n        \xc2\xa0\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <p></p>\n    <table>\n      <tr>\n        <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">\n          <a href="../index.html" shape="rect">Home</a>\n          \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0\n        </td>\n        <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">\n          <a href="index.html" shape="rect">Feedback</a>\n          \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0\n        </td>\n        <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">\n          <a href="education.html" shape="rect">Feedback-General</a>\n          \xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0\n        </td>\n        <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">\n          <select title="Open this list to choose a page" onchange="toNewPage(this)">\n            <option value="education.html">Education</option>\n            <option value="../anti_spam/feedback_antispam.html">Feedback to The Anti-Spam Home Page</option>\n            <option value="media_studies.html" selected="selected">Media Studies</option>\n            <option value="miscellaneous.html">Miscellaneous Topics</option>\n            <option value="on_evil.html">On Evil</option>\n            <option value="../what_is_science/feedback.html">Reader Feedback to &quot;What is Science?&quot;</option>\n            <option value="../is_math_a_science/feedback.html">Reader responses to &quot;Is Mathematics a Science?&quot;</option>\n            <option value="cosmology.html">Reflections on Cosmology</option>\n            <option value="../opinion/capital_punishment_feedback.html">Selected Replies to &quot;When Does it Become Murder?&quot;</option>\n            <option value="../dark_energy/feedback.html">Selected Replies to &quot;The Physics of Dark Energy&quot;</option>\n            <option value="../opinion/religion_feedback.html">Selected Replies to the article &quot;On Believing&quot;</option>\n            <option value="what_do_you_have_against_women.html">What Do You Have Against Women?</option>\n            <option value="where_is_my_data.html">Where is my Data?</option>\n          </select>\n        </td>\n        <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">\n          <a href="../anti_spam/feedback_antispam.html" shape="rect">\n            <img title="Click for prior page" alt="" border="0" src="../images/leftarrow.png"></img>\n          </a>\n        </td>\n        <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">\n          <a href="miscellaneous.html" shape="rect">\n            <img title="Click for next page" alt="" border="0" src="../images/rightarrow.png"></img>\n          </a>\n        </td>\n        <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">\n          \xc2\xa0\n          <a title="Recommend this page to friends" href="../administration/submit.php" shape="rect">\n            <img alt="" style="border:0px;" src="../images/addthis16.gif"></img>\n            \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Share This Page\n          </a>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n  </body>\n</html>'
