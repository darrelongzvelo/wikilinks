Lack of posts, & the dumbest product ever.

Posted on June 25, 2012 | 8 Comments

The sign outside of Sheffield Lanes/The Fallout Shelter in Aliquippa, PA this weekend.

I’ve noticeably slowed down with blogging .Â  Perhaps I was blogging too much
before.Â  Real life has been happening lately.Â  The band played twice this weekend, my
real job has been taxing, etc. Perhaps I’ll find inspiration more often in the days to
come.Â 

Like this…

Groupon has successfullyÂ  shown me what I believe to be the absolute dumbest product ever :

Image: http://aixelsyd13.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/car-lashes.png?w=500&h=443

Car Lashes …Wait, car -freaking-lashes?

I could rant about it, but do I really need to?Â  There would a a Herbie / Love Bug joke,
pointing out that putting them on a BMW decreases the value/classiness of the car, maybe a joke
about truck nuts & just maybe a reference to the movie Cars even though I’ve never seen
it.Â  Maybe even a joke about the dude I saw on My Strange Addiction who makes love to his car
for the crowd who likes it blue.Â  Maybe even an Optimus Prime humping your car joke.Â  I
have finally found something more annoying than flags on cars & more decorative than the
mysterious stickermobile .Â  If you’re going to glue stupid stuff to your car, go all the
way .

If there are any people out there with money to waste on stupid things, I’m taking donations
so I can buy a Flycaster .

Go to Best Buy and set all the alarms to go off, right now.

Posted on June 9, 2012 | Leave a comment

Did you read the email that I sent to them ?

I see this email reply as an (incredibly boring) invitation to go in to your local Best Buy &
monkey around with everything.Â  Especially the alarm clocks .Â  Does Best Buy even sell
alarm clocks any more?Â  If they do, do set them all to go off at weird intervals after
hours… or even 10 or 15 minutes before they close.Â  If they’re clock radios , put them on
the classical station or talk radio .Â  Do it on the demo cell phones if you can too.

This was their only [yawn] reply:

I guess they didn’t “get” it, or find it amusing.Â  Of course setting all the alarm
clocks is an innocuous thing to do at best, but I was acting like it was a big deal.Â  That’s
why (I thought) it was funny.Â  Wow.Â  Best Buy popped my funny balloon.

What a boring dud.

Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Beeps, & Buzzers âŒš

Posted on June 7, 2012 | 2 Comments

Well, I sent what I thought were going to be two rather fun emails, but they have both gone
unanswered.Â  Wow.Â  What a giant dud.Â  As my wife constantly reminds me, I certainly
find myself amusing.Â  So, in that spirit I thought I’d share these emails anyway.Â 
Perhaps you’ll chuckle too.

The first was to Best Buy via their form online and to the Twelpforce email address :

From: Waldo Lunar <world.and.lunar.domination@gmail.com>

Date: Thu, May 31, 2012

Subject: A Formal Apology

To: twelpforce@bestbuy.com

Greetings Best Buy Associates,

I write to you today to offer a formal apology.Â  I have lived with guilt for many years, and I
would like to be able to clear my conscience.Â  Sadly, you literally asked for what you got,
but you certainly didn’t deserve it my friends.Â  I beg you in advance to not unleash the
wrath of the Twelpforce or Geek Squad upon my humble self.

Do you remember the commercials from about ten or so years ago that begged one to come in & play
with all of the electronics in the store?Â  Well, I said you asked for it.Â  You did.Â  I
simply complied.

I went into one of your stores, and tried my best to restrain my maniacal laughter as I set all of
the alarm clocks & clock radios to go off at different intervals after the store closed.Â 
Some were 5 minutes, some where 10 or even 20.Â  It was incredibly hard to stifle my giggles
and pretend like I was incredibly interested in these timepieces.Â  I don’t know how no
one noticed.Â  Now I can’t get 10 feet into a Best Buy door without a blue-shirted hawk
swooping in to ask if I need help, and I’ll get asked every 3 feet after that if I turn it
down.Â  Perhaps shenanigans like mine are why?

At one time, I wished that I could have been around to see the chaos.Â  Okay, maybe I still
do.Â  Perhaps a master switch would have cut the power to all of them after the first one went
off.Â  I won’t pretend to know the internal machinations of such a colossal retail
empire.Â  Perhaps I made a memory for that team and brought them together through adversity
in the name of silencing alarm clocks.Â  Perhaps it is a good story to tell trainees, or it may
have even been forgotten over time.Â  I was much younger & more brash then.Â  I thought I
knew everything.Â  I thought the world was my playground. To be blunt, I was an arrogant
young miscreant.Â  I don’t remember if it was planned, or spur of the moment.

I’m sure that when the internet was still “new”, I set more than a few of your browsers to
my old band’s web page & walked away.Â  I did this in every store though, not just Best
Buy.Â  I won’t apologize for that.Â  A pimp’s got to pimp, right?

I would like to offer an apology to Best Buy as a corporation, the Best Buy employees startled
and/or annoyed that day (and their families), and to all of the Best Buy associates that have
joined the team since that day (somewhere between 2000 and 2002) .Â  I believe this was at the
Greensburg PA location across from Westmoreland Mall.Â  Please pass this along to them, if
there are any left that may have been working that day.Â  I have seen the err of my ways, and I
can live with the guilt no longer!

Thank you for your time, I hope you find it within you to pass along forgiveness for this
egregious behavior.

Regretfully,

-Waldo Lunar

The next one was to Bed Bath & Beyond via their webform :

Do you remember those Best Buy commercials from 10 or so years ago where they asked you to come in
& try the stuff out?

I did.Â  I went in one night & set all of their alarm clocks to go off about 5, 10, 15, or 20
minutes after closing.Â  I bet it was hilarious.Â  I only wish I had been there to see
it.Â  I bet that happened often.

I noticed that you have a lot of kitchen timers and egg timers.Â  What time do you close?

Thanks,

-Waldo

I thought it was funny.Â  Apparently Best Buy and Bed Bath & Beyond did not.Â  I did get the
standard “we got your message, someone will write back with in 3 days” replies, over a week
ago.Â  I really thought Best Buy would come out with a witty intelligent retort.Â 
You’d think an electronics company would be helmed by geeks who found humor in such
ridiculousness.Â  Bed Bath & Beyond apparently do not go too far into the beyond part.Â 
Oh well.

The Pittsburgh Tunnel Monster gets national attention?

Posted on May 24, 2012 | 6 Comments

Well, sort of.Â  The buzz around town on the news & radio lately has been about a survey by a GPS
data company called INRIX that calls the sweet spot from Greentree to the Fort Pitt tunnels on
the Parkway West here in the ‘Burgh the worst traffic outside of New York or Los Angeles.Â 
Read the Post-Gazette article for all the juicy details.Â  Here’s an excerpt…

According to INRIX, it takes an average of 13 minutes — nine more than it should — to
traverse that stretch. That doesn’t count the time it takes to get there, as morning backups
now routinely spill well down the back side of Green Tree Hill and sometimes past Carnegie.

At a delay of nine minutes a day, for a regular commuter that works out to about 36 hours a year
down the rat hole, just for the morning rush. According to INRIX, drivers on the 10 worst U.S.
corridors may squander up to 60 hours a year stuck in traffic.

Those who while away their mornings in the daily tangle might be inclined to dream of a wider
Parkway West or new tunnels drilled through Mount Washington, but financial and topographic
realities make that a bit like yearning for world peace.

The guys on the X were talking about it yesterday morning, so I sent Bob a link to my Tunnel
Monster blog .Â  Bob posted it on their morning show blog & I’ve been getting mad hits today
because if it.Â  Ha ha.Â  Thanks guys!

I do have to say though that the Steely McBeam tunnel monster image isn’t mine.Â  Someone
named Angry Mongo posted it first .

I have one more “ artist rendering ” from Eric Yano ( Iâ€™d still like to see more! ) :

Flying Tunnel Monster (by Eric Yano / Valley of Steel)

And here was the letter to MythBusters & Dirty Jobs , that didn’t get a reply from anyone…

From: Waldo Lunar <world.and.lunar.domination@gmail.com>

Date: Mon, Feb 27, 2012

Subject: The Pittsburgh Tunnel Monster (Mythbusters & Dirty Jobs team-up?)

To: jamie@m5industries.com, mythbusters@m5industries.com, adam@adamsavage.com,
info@mikeroweworks.com, torybelleci@gmail.com, swift@buchwald.com

Cc: info@beyondaction.com.au

Dear Duke of Dirt and Sultans of Science (or Emperors of Explosions?) ,

I’m a big fan of both of your shows, I believe that I have been watching since the first season
of each, and have seen almost all (if not all) of the collective episodes.Â  My wife & I enjoy
the Saturday morning/afternoon marathon runs of each, sometimes they prevent us for doing
anything productive (except learning while being entertained of course) for most of the
day.Â  My favorite Dirty Jobs moment has to be an early one… where Mike was at the charcoal
factory & asking the guy how you can burn it after it has already been burned and the guy either
didn’t know the answer or comprehend the question and started to get irate.Â  It set the
tone for the rest of the series!Â  Of course I love all the dirty gross stuff like expressing
the anal glands during pet grooming… who knew?Â  Having worked an assembly line myself, I
really appreciate that you manage to shed light on jobs that most people never even think about
(or know existed).Â  With Mythbusters, I don’t know how to pick a favorite… I loved the
ninja & pirate myths, the ancient mirror laser thing, all of the movie scene recreations (or
attempted recreations) , the many abuses of Buster, and for some odd reason… the car filled
entirely with A/B foam.

If I’m not watching the Discovery Network, I’m over on the History Channel .Â  My wife
likes to remind me that we have about 200 other channels.Â  I don’t need them, really.

I first attempted this (intentionally humorous) pitch to the people over at history with
MonsterQuest or MysteryQuest in my sights.Â  I had assumed I’d receive some sort of
“Yeah, whatever goofball” type of reply.Â  Sadly I have not received any reply at all.

The more I thought about it, I feel that this is a serious subject.Â  It would work for
Mythbusters… not sure how you could word the myth… but basically your task would be to get
to the bottom of seemingly inexplicable tunnel traffic/congestion.Â  You could look at
how people slow down when approaching, how throwing a roadside distraction (like a car
accident) in there would effect things?

As for Mr. Rowe, I’m sure that working in a tunnel is a dirty job.Â  There are nightly
cleanings/work in the Liberty tubes some times… and someone sets out traffic cones every
day for the changing of a lane’s direction when going into/coming out of the tunnel.Â 
I’m also guessing that being a Mythbuster (or one of their crew) is a dirty job.Â 
Pittsburgh is a little Hollywood lately, why not capitalize on it by coming to check out our
little town?Â  I know Grant & Tori were at the Zabmelli firework factory in New Castle once!

Did you see the incredibly forced Pawn Stars/American Pickers/American Restoration
crossover?Â  You guys could do way better than that, and it would be unscripted.

Here’s the meat of my original email… I believe that we have a monster in the Pittsburgh
area that you may want to check out.Â  It’s affectionately referred to as the Tunnel
Monster.Â  People in the southwestern Pennsylvania area live in a great fear of the Tunnel
Monster.Â  Many yinzer drivers slow down as they approach any area tunnel… but most
especially the Fort Pitt Tunnels , Liberty “Tubes” , and the Squirrel Hill Tunnels .Â 
I’ve heard theories that the tunnel monster also perhaps takes shelter in one or all of the
three rivers when not lurking in the tunnel.

Fear seems to increase in times of rain, snow, and (perhaps strangely) before sporting
events, holiday festivities, and large concerts.Â  I believe we have weekday tunnel
anxiety between 7:00am & 9:00am, and again from 2:00pm to 7:00pm at all tunnels.Â  I’ve
never heard a first-hand account of an actual sighting, but it’s clear that there is
something strange happening at these locations.Â  There are also spikes of Tunnel Monster
fear when traffic accidents happen nearby.Â  Perhaps the tunnel monster feeds on broken
down cars, flat tires, or the corpses left in the wake of fatal accidents?Â  Rubberneckers
seem to be ripe for the picking also.

I have personally seen 18-wheelers get to the entrance of a tunnel and turn completely around,
most likely out of fear of the tunnel monster perhaps lurking within the yellow-hued
florescent-lit man made caverns.Â  Some people go through the entire length of a tunnel
holding their breath so the tunnel monster doesn’t steal it, or honking their horn the
entire way to scare it off.Â  I’ve seen motorcycles and ambulances go right down the
center line at accelerated speeds, no doubt trying to avoid a tragic end.Â  I’ve even
heard of people tapping the roof of their car when spotting a Padiddle to ward off the evil
tunnel monster.Â  The theory perhaps being that the tunnel monster is on the hood of the
other car, and its webbed fin (a paddle or “padiddle”) is blocking one headlight.

I have seen strange markings on the inside of they Liberty Tunnels, but they have since been
covered-over.Â  They were strange numbers and hieroglyphic-like symbols that appeared
right before a construction project.Â  Do you think the crews working in the tunnel are in
any danger?Â  Perhaps it’s a conspiracy?Â  Are they in there hunting for the tunnel
monster under the guise of construction efforts while they cover up the monster’s cave
paintings?Â  Could the monster be some sort of Neanderthal, or perhaps a supernatural
being, or some sort of demon?

There are countless videos on YouTube documenting fearless drives through the Fort Pitt
Tunnels , but I don’t believe that any concrete video evidence has been recorded.Â  I have
attached some artist renderings of the Tunnel Monster that I have found on the internet.Â 
Perhaps you would like your experts to interview the area residents and come up with your own?

I really would like someone to get to the bottom of this Tunnel Monster thing, and I believe that
Monster Quest is perfectly suited for the job!Â  Thank you for your time, I hope to hear from
you soon!

So, now you know where my thought process has gone, & how it has developed.Â  I’d love your
consideration for this idea.Â  Please don’t make me turn to TV shows that I don’t watch
like Billy the Exterminator or Dog the Bounty Hunter.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you!

Not afraid of the Tunnel Monster,

-Waldo Lunar

I tried message boards, email addresses, all kinds of outlets… all to no avail.Â  Party
poopers.

Maybe this will get a reply:

@ INRIX So, have you looked at the #PghTunnelMonster as a reason for the congestion on the
Parkway West? aixelsyd13.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/in-â€Š —

Should I try PennDOT or the city of Pittburgh next?

I assure you, I am not McDonald’s.

Posted on May 3, 2012 | 22 Comments



Image: http://aixelsyd13.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/mcjoker.jpg?w=210&h=300
It’s happening again.Â  I still say it’s a fail of smart phones & tablet PC ‘s in their
navigation of the internet.Â  At least I hope that’s the problem.Â  It could just be
that some people are really not that bright. Maybe it’s a reading comprehension
problem.Â  They see a post about McDonald’s & complaints and they hit “contact”
thinking they’re somehow contacting McDonald’s, blissfully unaware that the url in the
address bar is http://aixelsyd13.wordpress.com/contact/ and has nothing to do with
McDonald’s.Â  I’m guessing that this is thanks to Google sending everyone who
searches “McDonald’s” & “email” or “complaint” to me.Â  Maybe the magic
words are “McDonald’s” & “Contact”?

    Actually, my incredible WordPress site stats show me most of the search terms that people
    used to land on my blog today.Â  The culprits are most likely…

    - mcdonalds.customercare@us.mcd.com (3 searches)

    

    - ella.jones@us.mcd.com (1 search)

    

    - mcdonalds food tv advertisement (1 search)

    

    - mcdonalds hand washing procedures (2 searches)

    



As you’re reading this, can you say it with me?Â  Seriously, out loud.Â  Ignore the
people around you as they look at you like you’re crazy.Â  Take a deep breath.Â  Say it
with me:

Eric Carroll (a.k.a. ERiC AiXeLsyD, a.k.a. Waldo Lunar, a.k.a. Bronco JalapeÃ±o) is not
McDonald’s.Â  He does not work for McDonald’s.Â  Emails sent through the contact
form at aixelsyd13.wordpress.com will not reach McDonald’s.Â  If I contact World (and
Lunar) Domination inexplicably thinking that it is somehow related to McDonald’s (or
Kmart ) , I will be publicly ridiculed on the internet.

I may have to put that on my contact page.Â  I’m guessing you won’t read it anyway if
you’re crazy enough to send me an email without really reading anything else on my page.

If the stuff was coming right to my email address , I could almost understand it.Â  But, this
is being typed into (or cut & pasted into) the contact form at my site… which looks like
nothing related to anything on any McDonald’s website .Â  This most recent one is
different in that this McDonald’s is apparently delinquent on a payment to a company that
cleaned out their most likely disgusting dirty fryer.Â  This is much more serious than a
simple screwed-up order or ignorant employee.Â  I’ll share it with you…

Subject: Re: W(aL)D Feedback [Sorry, I'm not McDonald's.]



Hello Jane,

    Unfortunately you’re mistaken, as you did not contact me earlier.Â  I am not
    McDonald’s.Â  I have simply blogged about McDonald’s & my interactions (or
    attempted interactions) with them.Â  For some odd reason, people keep landing on my
    website and contacting me, thinking that I am McDonald’s.Â  I assure you, I am not
    McDonald’s.Â  I don’t work for McDonald’s.Â  I don’t represent
    McDonald’s.Â  I can’t speak for McDonald’s.Â  I certainly can’t pay their
    bills.Â  I do sympathize with you though, as McDonald’s apparent ineptitude knows
    no bounds.Â  I am a blogger who makes light of their insanity with my own.Â  If you
    would like to follow my journey, please see the following blog posts.Â  They will help
    to prove & reinforce that I am not McDonald’s, and perhaps bring to light your own error
    in using my contact form instead of reaching out again to McDonald’s.

    - I AM NOT McDONALDâ€™S - Like you, Harmony, Shirley, Amber, & Jeffrey mistook me for
    McDonald’s.Â  This post also links to my earlier correspondence with McDonald’s
    in case you are interested, as well as valid alternatives to actually contact
    McDonald’s instead of me, because I am not McDonald’s.

    

    - Iâ€™m still not McDonaldâ€™s. - I inform Harmony, Shirley, and Amber that
    I’m not McDonald’s.Â  Harmony remains unconvinced.Â  I unintentionally
    angered local McManager, Scott Kausky.

    

    - OK, maybe I am McDonaldâ€™s? – Harmony’s husband steps in to assure me that I am
    indeed McDonald’s, even though though I am clearly not.Â  Mr. Kausky calms
    down.Â  I create some graphics proving that I am indeed not McDonald’s, & I share a
    McAdventure.

    

    - s,p×ŸÉ�uopÉ”É¯ Ê‡ou É¯É� Ä± - Really.Â  I laid it all out one
    last time for Harmony & her McHusband.Â  They never responded after this.Â  Perhaps
    they finally got the message?Â  I disclose more McDonald’s contact options, as I am
    not McDonald’s and contacting me does nothing but further amusement for myself & my
    readers.

    

    - McConsistency is Key. – Apparently despite all the other blog posts, I’m still the
    place to go to complain about McDonald’s.

    



    A bonus post, somewhat related:

    - My guest post on Ya Jagoff!!! | Who Designed The Fast Food DriveÂ Thru? Here I point out
    the insanity of their request to have my order ready before I can even see a menu.

    



    A super-special extra bonus post:

    - I’m not Kmart. – While I’m not McDonald’s, I’m also not Kmart.Â  Perhaps
    McDonald’s customers & Kmart shoppers are the same demographic?

    



    Perhaps you’re not interested in my blogs, but in exchange for you taking the time to
    read them I am prepared to help you in your plight for payment.Â  I have researched
    several ways for you to contact McDonald’s, none of which are the contact form located
    at my website.Â  Let us go through them together:

    - Perhaps you should reply to the email Ref#8770056.Â  I don’t know what the reply-to
    address is, because I am not McDonald’s.Â  I didn’t have anything to do with
    receiving or generating anything in that email chain.Â  Instead of replying to this
    email, you used my contact form .

    

    - You could try to Tweet at the McDoanld’s Twitter Team .

    

    - http://www.mcnewyork.com/14518 Is their page, it has limited contact information,
    no contact form or email address.Â  You can call them at (718) 824-4123 but I suppose
    that you have already tried that.Â  You could use their Apply Online form to apply for a
    job & try to collect once you go in for an interview.

    

    - I see from your email address that you work at Malachy Mechanical , perhaps you have some
    rather large intimidating men that work for you?Â  You could send them over with large
    wrenches to look intimidating & collect payment.Â  The address is 1101 East Tremont
    Avenue, Bronx, NY 10460 and they have terrible reviews on Google.

    

    - Try the McDonald’s Facebook page .

    

    - The McDonald’s website has a Restaurant Feedback form that you might try, instead of
    my contact form .

    

    - You could try McSucks.com and McDonaldsSucks.com to voice your concerns?

    

    - You could try to email McDonalds.CustomerCare@us.mcd.com or info@mcdonalds.com ,
    neither of which are me.

    

    - I believe (630) 623-3000 & (800) 244-6227 are the phone numbers for corporate, and not
    me.

    

    - Looking at the syntax of other emails, ny. 14518@us.stores.mcd.com orÂ 
    mcd.14518@us.stores.mcd.com Â  may be valid email addresses.

    

    - A Google search ofÂ ”@ us.stores.mcd.com ” & “New York” has also brought up
    these possible helpful McEmployees, none of which are me:Â 
    Erin.kendrick@us.stores.mcd.com , heather.weidenbruch@us.stores.mcd.com ,
    aaron.smith@us.stores.mcd.com , roger.curtis@us.stores.mcd.com ,
    JOANNE.GIRARDI@US.STORES.MCD.COM , HUBLER@US.STORES.MCD.COM ,
    james.beary@us.stores.mcd.com , tina.millette@us.stores.mcd.com

    

    - You could try the people I’ve dealt with, but it may anger them.Â  I’ll let you dig
    their contact information out of my blog posts if that’s the route you’re going to
    take.

    



I hope that I have been able to provide some clarity, amusement, and even some actual help today
(even though I am not McDonald’s) .Â  Good luck in your quest, this is most certainly more
annoying than the usual lack of ketchup packets or pattyless burger!Â  Have a nice day.

I am not McDonald’s,

-Eric Aixelsyd

Employees Must Wash Hands Â« Blurt

Posted on May 2, 2012 | 5 Comments

You must read this blog by Omawarisan, he swears that this is the only photo he’s ever taken in
a public restroom:

Employees Must Wash Hands Â« Blurt .

http://aixelsyd13.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/employees2520must2520wash2520hands.jpg?w=500&h=375

I propose a revolution where these signs are strictly adhered to.

We all know my feelings on public restrooms , hand-washing signs , bathroom attendants , and
stupid signs in general .Â  Omiwarisan takes it to the next level.Â  I applaud his
ingenuity and regularly enjoy his blog.Â  You should check it out.
