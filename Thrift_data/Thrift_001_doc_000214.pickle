I hadn\'t seen so many blue screens since the 1990\'s. Fresh off the plane, the machine to purchase tickets took our money without producing train tickets. The station agent cocked his head and displayed doleful eyes at our request for a refund. Like it was the most absurd thing he\'d ever heard! Then he walked around the room gesticulating at exhibits A, B, C, D...all blue screens on all computers, and he explained verbosely in Italian:\n                        <em>That\'s why</em>\n                        we wouldn\'t get a refund. He did finally produce our tickets, not because we explained how to fix the screen problem - which he dismissed with a flick of the hand; not because we subsequently insisted that he use a telephone work-around; but most likely because we threatened to sit there forever. We are\n                        <em>usually</em>\n                        in a big business hurry, but...\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        That was only the beginning of Blue Screens in Italy. Blue screens at the airport, blue screens at internet cafes, the hotels, the train stations, the offices, even at the empty museum exhibit -- how? This was a far cry from countries even a decade earlier where the remotest places, say in Asia, got on online and stayed up and doing business. That was my Italian experience.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Trials</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Today, Italy is still looking a little medieval, isn\'t it? All that ancient stone architecture with the tiny little windows romantic in one view, lends a sinister backdrop to the bizarre Perugia murder trial, which Perugians complain\n                        <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/02/italy-knox-perugia-idUSL5E7L20F320111002" shape="rect">sullied their town\'s reputation</a>\n                        .\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Then there\'s the other trial, that of the seismologists being tried for information they\n                        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/04quake.html" shape="rect">supposedly didn\'t provide</a>\n                        to townspeople of L\'Acquila before the earthquake. Thousands of scientists have written to protest the prosecution of scientists. Actually, the scientists did relay the risk of earthquake on that day, about 1:1000, but subsequently a government official garbled the message. At the same time, disturbingly, a non-scientist was claiming (falsely) to be able to predict earthquakes based on radon gas measurements. So that radon-guy jacked the townspeople up, then the official tried to reassure them, now the scientists are on trial.\n                        <sup>1</sup>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Shutting Down Speech</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        This week, the computer screens went black in Italy. The government introduced a new\n                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDL_intercettazioni" shape="rect">wiretapping bill</a>\n                        that imposed severe restrictions on online speech. The Italian bill declared that the online author of any \'alleged defamation\' would need to correct the problem within 48 hours or be punished by a large fine. Guilt of defamation would be in the eyes of the &quot;defamed&quot;.\n                        <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/10/blackout-in-italy-the-first-time-wikipedia-worldwide-has-done-anything-of-this-kind/" shape="rect">Wikipedia protested with a blackout</a>\n                        .\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Wikipedia\'s action got the bill partially changed to apply only to larger businesses, not blogs and Wikipedia. But\n                        <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/10/blackout-in-italy-the-first-time-wikipedia-worldwide-has-done-anything-of-this-kind/" shape="rect">as Nieman Lab explains, the bill stills stands.</a>\n                        Furthermore, it\'s the overall state of press freedom in Italy that\'s &quot;dismal&quot;. As Nieman Lab writes:\n                      </p>\n                      <blockquote>\n                        &quot;Berlusconi owns the influential private media company Mediaset; he exercises direct control over state television. Italy\'s 100,000 professional journalists, to get work, must belong to the Ordine dei Giornalisti -- a group that is, in effect, a modern-day guild. This year\'s Freedom House survey of global press freedom, citing \'heavy media concentration and official interference in state-owned outlets,\' ranked Italy as only \'partly free.&quot;\n                      </blockquote>\n                      <p>\n                        It makes it seem like blue screens would be the least of their problems. I know, it\'s totally biased to judge Italy on these select things, just it would be to judge Americans on their predilection for their cowboy hats, guns and anti-science moves. Nieman Labs interviews several people (from Perugia) who understandably worry how severely the government threatens press freedom. And of course many other governments, not only Italy, seek to curtail internet expression. If governments continue to corral the &quot;Internet&quot; -- rather, the now familiar &quot;internet&quot; - will we have to start calling it the &quot;Intranets&quot;?\n                      </p>\n                      <p> -------------------- </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <sup>1</sup>\n                        In a\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2011/03/Predicting-the-next-Tohoku-earthquake-and-tsunami.html" shape="rect">recent post</a>\n                        , we criticized Fox News for profiteering on the weird, absurd, and false earthquake predictions of Jim Berkland.

Confusing people about the\n                        <em>real risks</em>\n                        isn\'t just bad for science, it\'s an actual liability for governments.\n                      </p>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                  <div class="asset-footer"></div>\n                </div>\n                <div id="entry-557" class="entry-asset asset hentry">\n                  <div class="asset-header">\n                    <h2 class="asset-name entry-title">\n                      <a rel="bookmark" href="http://acronymrequired.com/2011/08/science-blogging-the-better-journalism.html" shape="rect">Science Blogging: The Better Journalism?</a>\n                    </h2>\n                    <div class="asset-meta">\n                      <span class="byline">\n                        By\n                        <span class="vcard author">a.r.e.</span>\n                        on\n                        <abbr title="2011-08-03T05:39:48-08:00" class="published">August 3, 2011 5:39 AM</abbr>\n                        <br clear="none"></br>\n                        \xc2\xa9 2004-2012, Acronym Required.\n                      </span>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                  <div class="asset-content entry-content">\n                    <div class="asset-body">\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Science Journalism Debauchery</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p> </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Has anyone aside from science bloggers had so many rules imposed on them? OK, maybe science journalists. In the 1990\'s, when the debate over genetically modified (GM) seeds motivated the headline: &quot;MUTANT CROPS COULD KILL YOU&quot; (\n                        <em>Express</em>\n                        February 18, 1999), the British government attempted to\n                        <a href="http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/gmfood/number10.html" shape="rect">correct the fear-mongering headlines</a>\n                        . That didn\'t work, so to stem future journalistic liberties of that sort, the Parliament tried to subdue the culture that propagated such rumors.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        They issued a\n                        <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/post/report138.pdf" shape="rect">a lengthy report</a>\n                        warning of further journalistic depredation from &quot;the approaching era of digital TV&quot; and the &quot;increasing ghettoisation&quot;. (No mention of the internet.) More journalists needed to be\n                        <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3810.htm" shape="rect">&quot;scientists&quot;</a>\n                        , they said, after surveying GM stories put out by all of\n                        <em>eleven UK publications over two days</em>\n                        . Only 17% of the stories were written by science journalists, they found, and not any of the commentary came from &quot;science writers&quot;. The Science and Technology Committee of the House of Commons, the Royal Society, and SmithKline Beecham suggested punishing future misbehavior, especially for getting the facts wrong:\n                      </p>\n                      <blockquote> &quot;media coverage of scientific matters should be governed by a Code of Practice which stipulates that scientific stories should be factually accurate. Breaches of the Code of Practice should be referred to the Press Complaints Commission.&quot; </blockquote>\n                      <p>\n                        Of course an editor at the\n                        <em>Independent</em>\n                        responded describing how writers could conquer the facts but still mislead the reader. Thankfully, there\'s often a compelling counterargument. So in the end, the report\'s authors settled for a rather bland collection of guidelines dealing with\n                        <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3810.htm" shape="rect">Balance; Uncertainty; and Legitimacy</a>\n                        .\n                      </p>\n                      <p> And of course while the Parliament fretted about the fate of genetically engineered crops, over at News of The World... </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Digital Science Journalism - Publishing Freedom</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        When science blogging came along it seemed to offer an alternative to the maligned mainstream media science journalism. But despite its growing stature, it too has been besieged by criticism. Some of this\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2009/03/yotta-yotta-yottabytes-content-is-king-newspapers-die-for-internet.html" shape="rect">came from mainstream media</a>\n                        , especially in the beginning.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        But interestingly, while traditional science journalism often gets attacked from the outside, online science journalists indulge in lots and lots of self-flagellation. Perhaps this is to be expected from people who labor at the frontier of the often masochistic bench science, replete with high rates of experimental failure. Or perhaps self-criticism makes it easier for science bloggers to generate conversation? Work out their identities? Get traffic?\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Of course there\'s much more to online science journalism then blogging, but I\'m going to limit my comments to that. Acronym Required started about seven years ago, and from the rather echoey halls of 2004 science blogging, the medium exploded. Now it impressively fills some of the gaping holes in other science journalism.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        We last commented on the state of &quot;science&quot; television programming\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2007/12/science-programming-lions-cannons.html" shape="rect">in 2007</a>\n                        -- and why comment further? The science blogging world offers an amazingly vibrant alternative, filled with witty, reflective, analytical, smart, and generous writers -- especially considering the frequent debauchery of mainstream journalism. Which makes the persistent whine of self-criticism all the more puzzling. Is it some evolutionary thrust gripping science bloggers to impose governing rules on their peers?\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        This is especially amusing in the context of how blogs started, to augment search. Search itself started in a era that included the (albeit, totally unrealistic) perception of internet as free of boundaries, regulations, and governments. Consider this piece from\n                        <a href="https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html" shape="rect">early 1996</a>\n                        :\n                      </p>\n                      <blockquote>\n                        &quot;We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.

For one, an early blog was often not much more than some geek saying -- &quot;hey I found this cool site&quot;:\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/" shape="rect">link</a>\n                        -- so I\'m cool too, right? These\n                        <em>&quot;trusted links&quot;</em>\n                        made a prehistoric stab at\n                        <em>&quot;community&quot; and </em>\n                        &quot;personalization&quot; -- because who could trust something called the\n                        <em>&quot;World Wide Web&quot;</em>\n                        , with its random collection of and unknown\n                        <em>&quot;links&quot;</em>\n                        ?\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Secondly, through innovation if not mindset, the Internet and blogging celebrated independence from tradition. As the internet expanded, many bloggers took to the medium in defiance of the exclusive world and onerous rules of offline publishing. The audience for blogs in the beginning was a very small group of internet users, frontiersmen strongly connected by their independence, who were by default &quot;the community&quot;.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Page Views</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        As the originators of the\n                        <em>real</em>\n                        commercial internet intended, soon people realized they could make advertising money on the internet, and &quot;pageviews&quot; became an all important metric. The number of people publishing on the internet grew and bloggers were then advised to\n                        <a href="http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article03200901.aspx" shape="rect">&quot;keep it short&quot;</a>\n                        . This advice about post-length was couched as insight about readers short attention spans. But it was as much about drawing pageviews and revenue.\n                        <em>&quot;Keep it short&quot;</em>\n                        and the unspoken\n                        <em>&quot;make us money&quot;</em>\n                        became compulsory over \'make it interesting\'.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        When Tumblr and Twitter arrived on the scene with\n                        <em>truly</em>\n                        short-form platforms, some of the same organizations then suggested that blogs could actually be a venue for\n                        <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/07/smart-editorial-smart-readers-and-smart-ad-solutions-slate-makes-a-case-for-long-form-on-the-web/" shape="rect">&quot;long-form posts&quot;</a>\n                        . Finally, just as the fashion industry moved away from dictating skirt lengths sometime in the 1980s, people eventually stopped dictating ideal post length. Of course they still told people what to do, they just moved on from making demands on post length.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>To Join Or Not To Join</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        It\'s my impression that science bloggers find more rules to bandy about than others, but granted, I don\'t have enough data to swear that economists, say, are really more laissez-faire. I couldn\'t possibly document all the various rules that science bloggers have proposed for other science bloggers over the years, but to illustrate my point, I\'ll mention a few.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        First there\'s the question of where to host your blog. Some insist that science bloggers should join a science blogging network. This came about when the number of online science bloggers reached a point where they could actually form a group. Those advocating joining offer compelling reasons -- traffic, exposure, &quot;community&quot;. Now, the number of such science blogging &quot;communities&quot; has surpassed our ability to keep track of them. There are still pros and cons to joining of course, depending on your goals, technical abilities, impressions of the different online venues, how your schedule might accommodate blogging, etc. But your agreeable answer to join is existentially far more critical to a potential host than to you. After all, the hosts wouldn\'t exist without the bloggers.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Of course the notion of &quot;online community&quot; includes many possibilities. Communities can be collaborative, nurturing, educational - great; or, if you\'ve\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2010/07/why-cant-we-be-friends-the-pepsi-wars.html" shape="rect">observed them in action</a>\n                        , joining such an online science community can be like joining the military, where participants --\n                        <em>&quot;travel to exotic foreign lands, meet interesting and exciting people, then kill them.&quot;</em>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Proving Your Worth</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Once the blogger decides where to put their blog, a barrage of other considerations and demands will follow. For example, in 2007\n                        <a href="http://www.bpr3.org/" shape="rect">bloggers for peer-reviewed research reporting (BPR3)</a>\n                        emerged, proposing\n                      </p>\n                      <blockquote> &quot;to identify serious academic blog posts about peer-reviewed research by offering an icon and an aggregation site where others can look to find the best academic blogging on the Net.&quot; </blockquote>\n                      <p>\n                        While interesting as a business aggregation proposal, the blog\n                        <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/peer-to-peer/2007/11/blogging_about_peerreviewed_re.html" shape="rect">&quot;Peer-To-Peer&quot;</a>\n                        diplomatically commented on the idea, saying it would be impossible for such an icon to assure the\n                        <em>&quot;quality of the blog post itself&quot;</em>\n                        . Or, we might add, to insure the quality of the writer\'s analysis, the quality of the science journal, the quality of the science research, and so on.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Questions of ethics in science blogging are constant, carrying on from earlier discussions of ethics in blogging and science journalism. Way back in 2003, bloggers started wondering\n                        <a href="http://www.cyberjournalist.net/news/000215.php" shape="rect">whether they should adopt journalists\' standards</a>\n                        . Perhaps journalism in 2003 was wrapped in mystique that shrouded realities like &quot;MUTANT CROPS COULD KILL YOU&quot;, but the drumbeat of ethics has since trailed science bloggers. I can\'t see how this could be useful people have written strong arguments noting\n                        <a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2008/09/18/because_we_have.html" shape="rect">that blogging wouldn\'t exist if bloggers weren\'t ethical</a>\n                        . Nor has the whole ethics thing really led to changed behavior as far as I can see, but those who push &quot;ethics&quot; will forever peer over our shoulders, stick in hand.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Still other people demand, as the Parliament did 1999, that science bloggers/journalists only blog about things they know. Quite a qualitative statement considering variations in breadth and depth of knowledge among both scientists and journalists. A comment\n                        <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/why_good_science_journalists_a.php#comment-1380539" shape="rect">here</a>\n                        provides a good rebuttal to that idea. You could also reason that writing solely about what you know at any moment, like the biomechanics of kangaroo tendons, for instance, despite how interesting, might also be good way to become a lazy, narrow minded, outdated, and one bored stiff writer.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Recently the subjects of anonymity and pseudonymity re-emerged and preoccupied many science bloggers. I\'m not going to weigh down this post talking about that, except to note 1) that the discussion has largely revolved around the value and necessity of a particular type of\n                        <em>individual</em>\n                        authentication, and 2) that the discussion has largely ignored the politics and economics driving such individual authentication.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Other people try mark out precise roles for science bloggers/journalists. Science writers should be\n                        <a href="http://blog.coturnix.org/2011/05/24/is-education-what-journalists-do/" shape="rect">&quot;educators&quot;</a>\n                        , they say, or\n                        <a href="http://explainer.net/2011/01/bora_zivkovic/" shape="rect">&quot;explainers&quot;</a>\n                        , or priests of\n                        <a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2010/12/the-line-between-science-and-journalism-is-getting-blurry-again/" shape="rect">&quot;how things work&quot;</a>\n                        . Each such suggestion is an invitation for extensive discussion and cogitation, and naturally other people will vehemently\n                        <a href="http://www.john-zhu.com/blog/2011/05/25/are-journalists-educators-does-it-even-matter/" shape="rect">disagree</a>\n                        with every proposal. So then why don\'t bloggers just do what suits them best? Or does the constant criticism and re-definition create\n                        <em>&quot;community&quot;</em>\n                        (and pageviews)?\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Getting The Details Right</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p> We\'ve touched on some general instructions to bloggers about how to blog about science. There are more detailed demands too, aimed at all of science blogging and journalism, as the divisions between online and offline media blur. For instance: </p>\n                      <ul>\n                        <li>\n                          2005:\n                          <em>\n                            Don\'t use the word\n                            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/opinion/18randall.html" shape="rect">&quot;Global Warming&quot;</a>\n                          </em>\n                          : Thus implored some scientists reasoning that people would confuse climate change with their local weather.\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                          <p>\n                            2006:\n                            <em>Don\'t use big words</em>\n                            : So lectured the film\n                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Olson#Flock_of_Dodos:_The_Evolution-Intelligent_Design_Circus" shape="rect">&quot;Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus&quot;</a>\n                            .

It employed character assassination on all fronts by advising scientists to drop their testy, pompous attitudes, while it basically infantilized people who were religious. Some scientists took this whole thing to heart, overlooking how the movie slyly played to both audiences. People who knew the fairly simple polysyllabic words could be secretly smug that they knew the words when the definitions flashed on the screen like some weird spelling bee; and the other side of the audience could be smug about the portrayal of scientists as surly and smug.\n                          </p>\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                          2007:\n                          <em>Don\'t publish on Fridays</em>\n                          : The IPCC panel and hundreds of scientists took flack from the communication &quot;framers&quot; for publishing their 2007 report on a\n                          <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/framing-science/2007/02/ipcc_report_fails_to_capture_m.php" shape="rect">Friday</a>\n                          (link accessed 04/11) because \'any veteran journalist would know better\'.

While pursuing better communication is incredibly important, as is presenting ideas compellingly, how much of science knowledge lost by miscommunication is really any responsibility or fault of scientists and journalists (online or offline)?

But is it that the medical profession that &quot;can\'t make up it\'s mind&quot;? After all, medical advice comes from science research studies. Maybe it\'s scientists who can\'t make up their minds?  In this post I\'ll explain why people puzzle me when they often complain that doctors/scientists &quot;can\'t make up their minds&quot;. Secondly, I\'ll explain why I believe this insidious popular notion is actually dangerous.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>\n                          Would the World Be Better if The Medical Profession\n                          <em>Didn\'t</em>\n                          Evolve?\n                        </strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p> My first point I\'ll pose in the form of a question -- would the complainers rather that science and medicine be static than dynamic? Lets take the subject of Collins\' NYT column that dealt with hormone therapy for female menopause. </p>\n                      <p>\n                        First, lets look briefly to history. Hormone therapy came of age in the 1960\'s, a half a century ago. For perspective, let\'s look at an accelerated time frame. A century ago, doctors didn\'t understand that bacteria caused food poisoning. Doctors who admitted patients for so-called &quot;ptomaine poisoning&quot; could\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2009/10/ptomaine-poisoning-e-coli-0157.html" shape="rect">wash out patients\' mouths, insert tubes in their stomachs, feed them milk</a>\n                        , and wring their hands as they watched people stricken with food-borne bacterial infections die. Fifty years later, things had progressed. By mid-century, scientists understood bacterial infections and how they could be treated with antibiotics.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Medicine in the 1950\'s and 1960\'s saw the advent of the polio vaccine, the development of ultrasound to see babies inside the womb, and treatment of chronic kidney failure by hemodialysis. In 1960 and 1961 scientists along the East Coast of the US learned that the Hepatitis A virus was caused by shellfish contaminated with raw sewage.  In the 1950\'s and 1960\'s doctors made\n                        <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/100/13/1364" shape="rect">major advances in cardiac surgery</a>\n                        so they could repair congenital heart defects in babies. Such repairs became feasible when doctors realized that they could use a patient\'s relative as a live &quot;heart and lung machine&quot;. From that, what I\'ll call a \'proof of concept\', technology advanced to machines that could keep patients oxygenated during heart surgery. As you can imagine, the first &quot;heart surgeries&quot; were a messy business, and as in every field of medicine. The 1950\'s and 1960\'s brought major improvements to medicine, but in fits and starts. Mid-century, post WWII was the era when hormone therapy became popular.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Who To Blame?</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Based on recent findings about the risks associated with hormone therapy, women and doctors now hesitate before turning to hormone therapy. Collins, who developed breast cancer that she attributes to hormone therapy, ended her NYT column with this:\n                        <em>&quot;Actually, I don\'t blame anyone. Except maybe the guy who wrote that &quot;Feminine Forever&quot; book.&quot;</em>\n                        She\'s referring to an early hormone therapy proponent and author, gynecologist Dr. Robert Wilson. Today, the book\'s title sounds suspiciously pseudo-medicine but it probably sounded different to women in the 1960\'s, half a century ago. In that time of &quot;women\'s liberation&quot;, Wilson chastised the predominantly male medical community for being callous to women.\n                        <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,840627-1,00.html" shape="rect">A 1966 Time Magazine article</a>\n                        described Mr. Wilson\'s complaints about doctors:\n                      </p>\n                      <blockquote>\n                        &quot;physicians generally dismiss post-menopausal changes as part of the \'natural\' aging process. Their attitude, [Dr. Wilson] suggests tartly, stems from the fact that &quot;most doctors, being male, are themselves immune to the disease.&quot; As he sees it, the menopause is &quot;castration,&quot; and [Wilson] asks whether his colleagues would tolerate so casually a similar fate in themselves.\n                      </blockquote>\n                      <p>\n                        So that was it. In the era of women\'s liberation, Wilson accused men as standing-by while women became one day bra-less free spirits, the next &quot;castrated&quot; at the youthful age of 50. Which is why in 1966, as\n                        <em>Time Magazine</em>\n                        put it:\n                      </p>\n                      <blockquote>\n                        All over the U.S., women in their 40s and 50s are going to doctors and demanding &quot;the pills that will keep me from growing old.&quot; Women in their 60s and over are asking for &quot;pills to make me young again.&quot; In each case, what they are really asking for are doses of hormones to slow down or reduce the ravages of age.\n                      </blockquote>\n                      <p>\n                        Now, a half a century later, science studies are finally catching up with individual accounts and showing that some of the\n                        <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/menopausal-hormones" shape="rect">risks people had always worried about</a>\n                        with hormone therapy could not be ignored. But for the last half a century some women got terrifying first hand knowledge of risks they probably had no had no idea they were assuming. Breast cancer is one of the most publicized concerns, with studies showing\n                        <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/menopausal-hormones" shape="rect">8 in 10,000</a>\n                        women per year contract breast cancer who wouldn\'t have without hormone therapy. In addition, women who take estrogen and progestin risk more strokes, blood clots and urinary incontinence.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        To be fair, there are associated decreases in the incidence of colorectal cancer and hip fractures with hormone therapy. Many women benefited and swore by hormone therapy. But the problem was, no woman nor her doctor, could predict which risk vs. benefits bucket she might fall into. That\'s always the hardest part, predicting risk given very few knowns and a vast number of unknowns. Today science continues to do research in order to try to find a way that women can glean the benefits of hormone therapy but not incur the risks.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        As hormone therapy fades in popularity it may seem intuitive to damn whoever made it popular. Perhaps hormone therapy was in part a cultural movement that\'s gone the way of hippies? Not quite. Half a century later, women\'s liberation is less of a cultural driving force in the United States, but women of all ages take\ntake\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2005/05/silicone-implan-1.html" shape="rect">other risks</a>\n                        , for instance with\n                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Makeover" shape="rect">plastic surgery</a>\n                        . Decades from now, this too might look silly. But now, there\'s all sorts of rational urging that not only to stay young looking, but to keep a job, to stay in the job market, women must stay looking youthful.\n                      </p>\n                      <p> Moving away from the NYT column, if you want to cast blame, there lots of targets. Profit making companies -- pharmaceutical, insurance and media -- all distort public health knowledge. Much has been said about each of these industries. </p>\n                      <p>\n                        But people should just as well blame the human body for not making medical science easier and more predictable. Genetic variation assures that people can react differently to the same treatments. The same medication that cures one person, will do nothing for another, and rare cases will kill another. Many women never incurred any negative outcomes from hormone therapy. Scientists are still working to understand why. Doctor try to apply that knowledge for patients\' health. Fortunately for all of us, scientists and doctors don\'t give up, therefore science and medicine continue to evolve. People who think change is a curse, who infer therefore that this progress is a curse should spend some time perusing old medical journals.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>The Logic of Blaming Scientists</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p> Medicine and science do change in half a century, true, and that\'s a good thing. But even if you\'re looking at science or medical progress over a short time span, does saying medicine/science can\'t make up its mind make sense? </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Isn\'t it a little like saying &quot;the press can\'t make up its mind&quot;? After all, science research is almost always translated for the public by the press. What would Bill Keller say? Do &quot;science columnists&quot; like John Tierney at\n                        <em>The New York Times</em>\n                        behave in concert with journalists/data movers like Julian Assange at WikiLeaks? Can these journalists (&quot;sources&quot;, to some) be lumped with journalists that come in the form of TV personalities blogging on the Huffington Post? Are they all part and parcel with twittering science journalism professors? Sure, you can clump together and label professionals if that feels convenient. But in an honest moment no one would compare the entire cohort of &quot;scientists&quot;, &quot;doctors&quot;, or even &quot;journalists&quot; to a school of sardines flitting hither and thither through the sea until they expire in Santa Barbara harbor from\n                        <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/12/local/la-me-dead-fish-20110312" shape="rect">depleting all available oxygen</a>\n                        .\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Just as absurd, the statement that science or medicine &quot;can\'t make up its mind&quot; presses the illogical notion that scientists collude in order to present the disparate or outlying findings that you immediately find looking across any subject\'s vast body of research. I\'m sure scientists would love to be gifted with such inordinate non-existent powers over research grants, graduate student experiments, science publishing, reviewers, etc. in order to collude, but the universe is not so magical.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Clearly, the fact that these statements about science agenda\'s, ignorance, or malevolence do not make sense, but that does not stop their spread. And while the NYT lede was perhaps tongue in cheek, the very common sentiment that scientists can\'t tell what\'s going on from all the conflicting research leads to more insidious behavior. This is our second point.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Fostering Dangerous Attitudes about Science and Medicine</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Propagating the myth that scientists and doctors present &quot;conflicting&quot; results, and &quot;can\'t make up their minds&quot; leads citizens to exasperation with research. Few acknowledge how it\'s all filtered through the press. Fewer still peruse the even the summary, called an &quot;abstract&quot;, of original studies, most of which are publicly available online (for instance health at\n                        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" shape="rect">Pubmed</a>\n                        ).\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        In this way, the commonly expressed sentiment that scientists change their minds can become in essence a self-serving excuse for apathy: \'How can I take care of my health when scientists and doctors can\'t even make up their minds?\' As the subtitle of the NYT article puts it: &quot;It\'s very difficult to be a civilian in the world of science.&quot; Oh, woe are we. But ironically, by blaming scientists/doctors, citizens resign themselves to fate and thus open themselves to manipulation.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        So second to pointing out the fundamental essence of science and medicine that advances at a rapid pace, fortunately for us, I suggest that the myth that scientists can\'t make up their mind is insidiously destructive because it enables manipulation of the public in matters of science and medicine.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        In personal health, if people believe they are helpless, they\'re less likely to try and understand the science that effects them, less likely to do research, and less likely ask questions of doctors. Distrust of allopathic medicine can also lead people to ignore doctors, to turn to &quot;woo-woo&quot; theories, or to become susceptible to relentless pharmaceutical advertising and absurd press headlines aimed at readers. It\'s fine to criticize woo-woo science, as many scientist do, taking on homeopathy, acupuncture, anti-vax, chiropractic, chrystals, etc.; but scientists and critics intellectually blinkered if they do that without acknowledging the anti-science industry that gives these sorts of &quot;healers&quot; their power.\n                      </p>\n                      <p> Once people have fully accepted the premise that scientists and doctors &quot;can\'t make up their minds&quot; on personal health data, it\'s a small step to convince them that science can\'t make up &quot;it\'s mind&quot; on anything else either. </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Are climate scientists predicting an Ice Age or Global Warming, cry shills for energy &quot;business as usual&quot; (BAU) such as fossil fuel lobbies? And now we have almost half of the US population not believing in climate change, a situation that doesn\'t bode well for any species. I simplify this of course, people also choose not to believe in climate change because they don\'t see anything they can do about it. But often that learned helplessness starts with a false indictment of scientists. As in personal health, the false indictment that scientists really don\'t know anyway is self-serving because it breeds fatalistic apathy.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The apathy leads to further victimization by those who work most effectively when citizens don\'t pay to close attention. Not only do people believe they can\'t do anything about global warming, they justify their stance by saying the scientists don\'t know what\'s happening either. This becomes the perfect atmosphere for severe policy moves like the destruction of the EPA. Polluted air and water disproportionately effect the elderly, poor, and very young who can\'t protest, but in the end it will effect everyone. Propagating distrust in science by claiming science can\'t make up it\'s mind creates the perfect apathetic breeding ground for such radical policies.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        To conclude, I heartily disagree with the idea the medicine or science can\'t make up it\'s mind. First, too often people confuse press headlines with medical advice derived from many research studies, each of which is only a building block to public health recommendations. As medical history shows, it\'s these changes, commonly called progress, that has expanded our lifespan (albeit with risks). It defies logic to say that scientists collude to create conflicting results. Most importantly, the popular idea that science or health professionals &quot;can\'t make up their minds&quot; feeds a learned helplessness that in turn opens citizens to further manipulation.\n                      </p>\n                      <p> ------------------- </p>\n                      <p> Whose responsibility is it to make sure that people understand science research? In the end, it\'s the people\'s, it\'s society\'s. Unlike many others, I don\'t agree that it\'s up to the scientists\' to educate the general public. But that\'s the subject of another post. </p>\n                      <p> -------------------------------------- </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <sup>1</sup>\n                        Pointing out that the media can distort the actual results of studies for the sake of a headline, we asked why, for instance, the lead author would be quoted in this\n                        <em>Science Daily</em>\n                        study saying &quot;We have known for many years that people with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes should limit their caffeine intake&quot;, when the author\'s actual science journal study (M.-S.

Possibly. In some cases.&quot;</em>\n                        Not only that, she continues, current research shows that calcium pills are not &quot;good&quot; anymore and because of conflicting research women don\'t know whether or not to check for lumps or even get mammograms.  The column seems sympathetic to women, who are presented as collectively confused by the scattershot findings of medical research:\n                        <em>&quot;\'It\'s very difficult to be a woman,\'&quot;</em>\n                        Collins quotes Dr. Leslie Ford of the National Cancer Institute.\n                      </p>\n                      <p> You understand what she\'s saying.

Give them plastic bottles or not? </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The bottom line is, we all care to some extent about personal health choices, and depend on the latest research to make our decisions. Doctors can help by passing on recommendations based on the research and their own filtering of the risks of one action or another. But the research can be confusing. One research study rarely drives a decision, rather, bodies of research sway medical recommendations like the one to recommend that women take hormones after menopause to preserve youth. And now, 50 years later, the recommendation that women not take hormone pills.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        When hormones were first recommended for women a half a century ago, even then there\n                        <em>were</em>\n                        <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,840627-3,00.html" shape="rect">concerns about possible side effects</a>\n                        . But doctors, women, and media surged ahead with treatment. Now, after many women have stopped hormone therapy recent studies are showing that some women benefit from hormones while for others there\'s limited risks. The science is slowly capable of a finer grain analysis of the issues.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The tricky part is translating the results of many research studies into public health recommendations. As this challenges doctors and those in public health, patients are also confused by what sometimes seems like an arbitrary process. The barrage of pharmaceutical ads on television is not helpful. And the barrage of &quot;studies&quot; reported in the press is mind-numbing. Based just on the media, it\'s too easy for the consumer to view each study as a separate public health recommendation, since the press presents studies not necessarily to educate but grab eyeballs and sell ads.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Is Coffee Bad For You?</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Take for instance the press report last week on research that people who eat fatty meals then drink coffee can raise their blood sugar -- dangerously.\n                        <em>Science Daily</em>\n                        published an article titled:\n                        <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110401085604.htm" shape="rect">&quot;Got a Craving for Fast Food?

Let\'s check it out. What do other studies find? Indeed, previous research suggests there\'s a connection between caffeine and diabetes. For instance in the column to the right of the story on the\n                        <em>Science Daily</em>\n                        site, under &quot;Related Stories&quot;, is a link to one story titled:\n                        <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080128084449.htm" shape="rect">&quot;Cutting Caffeine May Help Control Diabetes (Jan. 28, 2008)&quot;</a>\n                        . So two studies that say the same thing, that caffeine is linked to diabetes, and cutting it may control diabetes.\n                      </p>\n                      <p. href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100609111316.htm" a="a" called:_="called:_" one="one" this="this" story="story" another="another" is="is" title="title" that="that" under="under" right="right" confusingly="confusingly" wait.="wait." but="but">\n                        &quot;New Evidence That Drinking Coffee May\n                        <em>Reduce</em>\n                        the Risk of Diabetes (June 10, 2010)&quot; (my emphasis). Aha! That story conflicts with the other two in saying that caffeine may reduce diabetes.\n                        <p>\n                          <strong>What Happens to Mice who Drink Coffee Instead of Water?</strong>\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          I\'m going to call this the &quot;The Caffeine Controversy&quot;. The latest 2011 and 2008 stories appear to agree, so lets look at the 2010 story, published in &quot;ACS\' Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry&quot;. I\'m not an expert in caffeine physiology or diabetes, so I\'m going to do some basic stuff to try to learn more about whether I should believe the study.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          First, who\'s the publisher? Different journals have different levels of clout or respect. ACS, the American Chemical Society is a professional organization for chemists, not to be confused with the lobby group the American Chemical Council (ACC). The researchers come from Nagoya and Kinki Universities, in Japan, as well as Pokka Corporation, a drink company.  4 out of 12 researchers come fom Pokka Corporation and the coffee used in the study was &quot;a gift&quot;. So hmmm...It\'s not that coffee is that expensive or that great research isn\'t done by corporations, but just in general, how often does corporate sponsored research show that\n                          <em>their product</em>\n                          is dangerous to health? But lets keep looking at this study anyway.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          The actual title of the paper is &quot;Coffee and Caffeine Ameliorate Hyperglycemia, Fatty Liver, and Inflammatory Adipocytokine Expression in Spontaneously Diabetic KK-Ay Mice&quot;, which is way more nuanced than the press title\n                          <em>&quot;New Evidence That Drinking Coffee May Reduce the Risk of Diabetes&quot;</em>\n                          . The study looks at physiological markers of lab mice genetically altered to become insulin resistant. The mice were given coffee instead of water in their diet, before being tested for biochemical markers hyperglycemia and diabetes.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          We could look further at the specific tests they did, their statistics, the length of the study, the amount of caffeine used, or the effects of substituting coffee for water. We could examine their specific results, for instance fasting blood sugar was statistically insignificant between both groups, so they did an insulin tolerance test that showed the desired difference. But like most people, we don\'t have the immediate knowledge of the idiosyncrasies of these tests, so this would take a fair amount time. So instead let\'s look for studies that seem from the outset to be without conflicts of interest.\n                          <em>Not</em>\n                          that you should\n                          <em>ever</em>\n                          make assumptions.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          <strong>What Happens to Humans who Drink Coffee?</strong>\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          So far we\'ve looked a three studies and still don\'t have an answer, therefore the benefits or dangers of coffee remain &quot;a controversy&quot;. And we don\'t even drink coffee, so do we care?  But we\'re really curious about this statement from the researcher in the latest 2011 study,\n                          <em>&quot;We have known for many years that people with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes should limit their caffeine intake.&quot;</em>\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Why are we curious? This is a significant statement. According to NIH statistics from 2011,\n                          <a href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/statistics/&quot;" shape="rect">diabetes affects 25.8 million people</a>\n                          . This amounts to 8.3 % of the US population according to the NIH, 11% of people over 20 years old, and 26.9% of people over 65 years old. About 30% of people over 65 years old have undiagnosed diabetes.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          According the National Coffee Association daily coffee drinkers make up around\n                          <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/03/08/us-coffee-conference-trends-idUSN0836748420080308" shape="rect">50% of the US population</a>\n                          of about 300 billion people. Obviously, there\'s an overlap between these two huge groups. So it would be really relevant if the advice &quot;avoid coffee consumption&quot; were to be added to &quot;exercise and lose weight&quot; to prevent diabetes? And if this is the case, why then, do at least some hospitals treating patients who are diabetic allow them to drink coffee?\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          We\'ll turn to PubMed, where lots of published science research is collected. Fortunately, other researchers have also turned to Pubmed or MEDLINE to answer this very question. Two epidemiology studies have recently found that coffee actually\n                          <em>lowers</em>\n                          incidence of type II diabetes. These are fairly large studies that if true would dispute the current study. Lets look briefly at them.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          One group from Harvard\'s Departments of Nutrition and Epidemiology, Brigham and Woman\'s, Harvard Medical School, and Vrije Universiteit\'s Department of Nutrition and Health,  searched MEDLINE through January 2005 and found nine cohort studies culminating 193,473 study participants. They results of all these studies show that habitual coffee consumption decreases risk of Type II diabetes (van Dam et al: &quot;Coffee Consumption and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes A Systematic Review&quot; JAMA. 2005;294(1):97-104. doi: 10.1001/jama.294.1.97). That\'s a pretty solid epidemiological finding. The group doesn\'t appear to have conflicts of interest.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          A second group with researchers from the US, France, Australia, Netherlands and Scotland. Huxley, R. et al: &quot;Coffee, Decaffeinated Coffee, and Tea Consumption in Relation to Incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis&quot; looked at prospective studies between 1966 and 2009, 18 studies with 457,922 participants, also found an inverse relationship between diabetes and self-reported coffee, as well as tea and decaffeinated coffee drinking. This too is a solid finding. So these two studies differ from the one we\'re looking at, but it\'s fair to say that the results of epidemiological studies can differ from studies showing some metabolic influences of coffee.\n                        </p>\n                        <strong>Should Humans Forgo Coffee?</strong>\n                        <p> </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Of course there are more studies, in humans, in mice, epidemiological studies, and biochemical and physiological studies. For now, although it seems as though coffee may indeed alter glucose homeostasis,  this may not add up to something that can be seen in epidemiological studies. It doesn\'t mean coffee doesn\'t have an effect, or isn\'t harmful. We could keep looking at studies if we drank coffee and wanted to make a decision about this. But circling back to the original study, we\'d venture that the Ph.D student/researcher\'s statement,\n                          <em>&quot;we\'ve known for years&quot;</em>\n                          that people at risk for diabetes (a third the population) shouldn\'t drink coffee (1/2 the population) is at best hyperbolic. More so considering that the paper\'s discussion section notes that one of their results may explain the\n                          <em>&quot;negative correlation between long- term coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes risks&quot;.</em>\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          And since this was reported in\n                          <em>hundreds</em>\n                          of news reports, lets also look quickly at the methodology. The 2011 paper used 11 volunteers. Being that this was a controlled experiment, subjects fasted for 12 hours after going two days without coffee, exercise or alcohol. The researchers then had participants drink a &quot;fat cocktail&quot;, which consisted of 1 gram of fat/1 kg of body weight. (I don\'t know what the exact fat composition of the drink was because I couldn\'t find the &quot;Supplemental Table II&quot;.)\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          But if you were a 160 pound male (72 kg), your experimental &quot;fat cocktail&quot; would consist of 72 grams of fat, which amounts to 5.5 tablespoons of soybean oil (one of the ingredients used in the study); or more familiar to most people, 24 tablespoons of half &amp; half cream; more than\n                          <a href="http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/nutritionexchange/nutritionfacts.pdf" shape="rect">3 McDonald\'s Double Cheeseburgers</a>\n                          ; (.pdf); or about 3 orders of large McDonald\'s French Fries. I don\'t know what you think, but this pile of food would be outside the range of and meal choice for me. The participants then waited five hours, before drinking the caffeine equivalent of 2-3 cups of coffee (5 mg/kg body weight). 1 hour later they were fed 75g of dextrose (like glucose) - about 75 grams of high-glycemic carbohydrates. By comparison, a large Coke from McDonalds has about 86g of carbohydrates and a package of sugar has about 4 grams of carbohydrates. This protocol, the fat then the sugar after a 12 hour fast, caused a physiological response in the participants. Suprise?\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          <strong>Crave Fast Food? Skip The Three McDonald\'s Cheeseburgers</strong>\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          &quot;Craving Fast Food, Skip the Coffee&quot;, the title of the press report warns.  But what if when &quot;craving fast food&quot; you just skipped the three cheeseburgers? What if you just had a small coffee in the morning, with your non-fat yogurt or your dry toast, ok maybe a pat of butter. What would that do? What if the press report for any study actually reported the real story about the research?\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Or, what if the press report just included the actual title of the research? In this case the title of the research was: &quot;An Oral Lipid Challenge and Acute Intake of Caffeinated Coffee Additively Decrease Glucose Tolerance in Healthy Men.&quot;  This is a lot different than what the media reported. And while eating 6 tablespoons of soybean oil upon arising AM after a 12 hour fast might be something some people do, and indeed the results may be interesting, how does this translate to any sort of public health recommendation like the ones the authors and news is trying to make?\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          What if when interviewed, the lead author said, as she did in her paper\n                          <sup>1</sup>\n                          that while a few studies have shown glucose responses to caffeine, there is actually a\n                          <em>&quot;negative correlation between long- term coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes risks?&quot;</em>\n                          What\n                          <em>Science Daily</em>\n                          published instead was basically a false statement\n                          <em>&quot;We have known for many years that people with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes should limit their caffeine intake&quot;</em>\n                          , which the researcher qualified (above) by advising people not to eat a lot of red meat and to drink decaf. Isn\'t this last advice, just common sense? But then does it follow from their study? No. It\'s previous research.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          As a consumer of health news, it\'s worth reading the actual studies, or even just looking at the title, because as we showed, they often contradict the headline in the press. Secondly studies differ. Epidemiological studies where people self report, differ from other literature reviews, differ from lab mice studies, and from studies where people are attached to an IV. Different methodologies between the same type of study can yield different results.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          As consumers we could try to understand all the nuance differences, but like Gail Collins, I think it\'s impossible. It\'s enough just to know that different methodologies can produce different results but that doesn\'t necessarily mean anything. This may sound confusing, but it isn\'t any more confusing then talking to multiple people about anything, from fixing the squeak in your car to whether your tie looks good.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          You may rightly point out that the caffeine controversy is different than the estrogen controversy that Collins refers to. But it\'s really not. You have scientific research presented by the media, which is a meld of companies with vested interests, scientists, reporters biases and limitations, and doctors and clinicians. Consumers (patients) need to make sense of it all.\n                        </p>\n                        <p> Tragically, people got cancer from estrogen therapy. People will die from heart attacks, obesity, diabetes. Decisions they make about coffee may influence the rate of their demise, but we don\'t exactly know how. The indefiniteness of research today does not help us make today\'s decisions. </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Or does it? Is it the science or medical professions who confuse us? Doctors? Or the press and pharmaceutical companies? Or do we confuse ourselves rather than trying to understand some basic stuff about scientific publishing, press releases, the news industry, doctors, and business?  In the case of our 2011 science research study on caffeine, the actual peer-reviewed published study was fairly informative about the limitations of the research. Even the title was elucidating. I haven\'t yet seen widespread physician\'s recommendations regarding the dangers of coffee. The most hyperbolic accounts in this case occurred in the press (perhaps with the help of the Ph.D. student - and where was the adviser?)\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Most professions are required to take continuing education credits. If we\'re in charge of our health except for periodic ten minute interactions with the doctor, maybe we should be trying to understand how science, medicine and news industries work in order to take care of ourselves? I\'m not talking about diagnosing ourselves. In this case, most consumers know what a somewhat healthy diet looks like, and that it doesn\'t involve 3 orders of large fries at McDonalds for breakfast. People know they need to exercise. The consensus of scientists and doctors is not controversial, it\'s simple, we need not be confused. But fruits, vegetables and exercise don\'t sell newspapers and pharmaceutical drugs.\n                        </p>\n                        <p> ---------------- </p>\n                        <p>\n                          <sup>1</sup>\n                          M.-S.

Citizens have been barraged with guidance from official and unofficial sources about how much attention to pay to the deluge of unsettling news. At first most officials advised there was no new &quot;news&quot;, which could mean anything, but seemed to implore: Pay no attention! Pay no attention! Which compelled WikiLeaks and news outlets to argue that indeed,\n                        <em>it was new news</em>\n                        , and proceed to line item the &quot;new news&quot; in gory detail.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        So then commentators put forth a more nuanced stance.

When told by Sanchez that WikiLeaks was redacting information in 15,000 docs to prevent that sort of thing, Baker responded that WikiLeaks was inept at that task because they couldn\'t know which information was dangerous. WikiLeaks could only pretend to protect sources and individuals in the documents, Baker said. The government was far more qualified to know which information to redact when they released information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). But even the government made mistakes he said.

But let\'s consider that. The Church of Scientology has it\'s awful secrets.  Popes and the highest leaders of the Catholic Church, squirreled away very\n                        <em>private</em>\n                        church data for centuries. Only when brave victims, mostly young boys, stepped forward en masse to reveal the priests\' transgressions was the destructive force of those crimes revealed. If technology had enabled a leak earlier on would some of those crimes been prevented?\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>The Sacrosanct Institutions and Freedom of Information</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The letter to the\n                        <em>New Yorker</em>\n                        editor could have been referencing the church of government. It could have been referencing the church of the military, the church of hacking, or the church of journalism.  \nYou don\'t need the FOIA to access WikiLeaks\' cache of secret documents. The government has (at least momentarily) lost a smidgen of control, as have sanctified journalists, and the Church of Scientology has fewer secrets. Assange asserts that this is a good thing and his goal.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Look for instance at &quot;the church&quot; of journalism. What is &quot;journalism&quot; these days? Is it a useful tool for eliciting government response and context as Lucy Dalglish says? Or is journalism, due to technology and psychology research, more and more the public relations arm of institutions? Does it live up to its potential? Do we really need generals to put war incidents in context for us? Or as citizens, can we be enticed to be both interested and trusted as intelligent judges of how effectively our tax money is being used in wars? Or is that a fairy tale? More pragmatically, isn\'t there just\n                        <em>too much information</em>\n                        for the fourth estate to efficiently parse it all for us?\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Long ago, when the internet first came to be, some crazy people thought it would provide a new frontier for open information, would break the barriers erected by states. But ordinary citizens have always found themselves on the wrong side of information asymmetry when it came to knowing what governments were up to. WikiLeaks shows another possibility. Maybe in this new age, as Obama promised, government could indeed be\n                        <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment/" shape="rect">transparent, participatory, and collaborative</a>\n                        . Maybe the Obama government will in this way, accomplish its information goals.  But perhaps all the transparency won\'t all be found at sites like transparency.gov in the cloud. Maybe Open Government will be  defined by world citizens like Assange, too.\n                      </p>\n                      <p> </p>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                  <div class="asset-footer"></div>\n                </div>\n                <div id="entry-528" class="entry-asset asset hentry">\n                  <div class="asset-header">\n                    <h2 class="asset-name entry-title">\n                      <a rel="bookmark" href="http://acronymrequired.com/2010/07/why-cant-we-be-friends-the-pepsi-wars.html" shape="rect">Why Can\'t We Be Friends?

But some bloggers get increasingly spiteful as they vie for the attention that blogging compels, then use that attention to generate a certain brand of PR for SB. The level of conversation often spirals downward (there must be some entropy model that describes it). And that downward spiral seems infectious -- I\'ve noticed\n                        <em>Nature</em>\n                        has been forging new ground lately in diluting their brand with some profane blogs also.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Pepsi\'s not the first one to feel SciBlingon wrath, though sleepy-hot July always gives these incidents an extra charge. Remember the\n                        <a a="a" _="_" href="http://acronymrequired.com/2008/07/science-publishing-kerfuffle.html" shape="rect">Nature/Butler/PLoS fracas of July, 2008?</a>\n                        It was similarly acrimonious with a familiar corporate/underdog theme.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        These bloggers know their power, they say. But this is how SB looks from the outside, to me, an independent sometimes-blogger. Everyday science bloggy, bloggy, bloggedy, great - oh, too boring? Yawn? Then Boom, Smash, Bang, big tizzy over at ScienceBlogs over something, lots of media coverage. Repeat. For someone not in the thick of it, the episodic commotions tempt a plea for perspective.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        I hope ScienceBlogs settles -- certainly finding eager writers shouldn\'t be a hurdle, and there\n                        <em>are</em>\n                        60 left. I look forward to future writing from the diaspora. But I would also venture that it\'s complicated, messy business, this advertising stuff, this ethical boundaries stuff. It\'s pretty easy to inadvertently be seen as hypocritical trying to carve arbitrary ethical boundaries that suit your own very personal interests.  As a minor, minor example, isn\'t most blogging just personal branding/advertising? But\n                        <em>your</em>\n                        brand is pure as the driven snow, whereas Pepsi\'s is marred by soda pop? Anyway, I\'m not sure getting Pepsi off of ScienceBlogs, although certainly a &quot;cause&quot;, was one worthy of the show or the arena.\n                      </p>\n                      <p> (To Be Continued) </p>\n                      <p> -------------------------- </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <sup>1</sup>\n                        Actually, in another &quot;City By The Bay&quot;, they plan to grow\n                        <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_15570808?source=rss" shape="rect">pot by the acre</a>\n                        , an unfortunately timed news story which you\'d think would crush my defense.

Boehringer\'s studies showed that low libido women who took the &quot;film-coated, 100mg tablets&quot; had on average\n                        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/business/19sexpill.html" shape="rect">&quot;.8 more satisfying sexual events (SSE) per month</a>\n                        (hey, it\'s statistically relevant) than the control group. But the drug caused side effects such as nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. The panel said the company did not prove that the drug increased desire despite Boehringer\'s claim that an SSE was an adequate &quot;downstream&quot; measure of desire.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The drug is controversial for reasons other than efficacy and side effects. Boehringer says research shows HSDD affects 6-10 percent of women. But half of that study\'s researchers were\n                        <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/stories/s2927592.htm" shape="rect">company consultants and employees</a>\n                        , and speakers attending the hearing disagreed that the low libido occurred that often. Nevertheless, the Boehringer crafted an intensive marketing strategy to build buzz around flibanserin. In Australia, the marketing firm Ethical Strategies Pty Ltd invited influential sex experts to Sydney on behalf of Boehringer to &quot;discuss a common yet relatively unrecognized medical condition&quot;. The company offered payment of $1,000, airfare, food, and accommodation. The experts discussed the important &quot;research&quot; and strategies to increase awareness of HSDD, and their participation, promised Ethical Strategies, was &quot;confidential&quot;.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        None of this is too shocking, but doctors and researchers\n                        <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/06/18/eveningnews/main6596444.shtml" shape="rect">voiced their disapproval</a>\n                        of Boehringer\'s approach calling it a\n                        <em>&quot;thinly veiled marketing campaign filled with bias, misinformation and celebrity endorsement&quot;.</em>\n                        One noted that &quot;\n                        <em>women don\'t need treatments with real side effects for imaginary diseases designed by a marketer&quot;</em>\n                        , and others offered their opinions that the research was a\n                        <em>&quot;scam&quot;</em>\n                        and not of\n                        <em>&quot;clinical meaningful benefit&quot;.</em>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>Fear of Flying?</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        HSDD itself is a disputed diagnosis.

At the time, we wrote in\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2009/10/epa-jackson-chemicals.html" shape="rect">&quot;The EPA Speaks To Me&quot;</a>\n                        that Jackson\'s speech, like the president\'s sweeping public orations,\n                        <a href="http://bit.ly/JK249" shape="rect">promised something for everyone</a>\n                        :\n                      </p>\n                      <blockquote>\n                        &quot;The more I read, the more Jackson\'s speech looked like a veritable public relations jambalaya. She spoke to those committed to wetlands, spotted owls, to asthma sufferers, climate change, to those concerned about coal and gas emissions, to the Clean Air Act, to trash incineration, dioxins, pesticides, green chemistry, research, unions, medical professionals, public health groups, industry, environmentalism, to those who want jobs, fast food packaging, to unborn children, African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos and postal workers, as well as everyone who emails public comments to the EPA or who\'s concerned about health care or health...&quot;\n                      </blockquote>\n                      <p> </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2009/10/epa-jackson-chemicals.html" shape="rect">I commented at the time</a>\n                        that her speech was clearly a &quot;marketing tool and conversation generator but not a public policy statement.&quot; We could get mad about a lot of things in her speech, I\'m sure, if we took it as public policy commitment.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>If Only Talking Made Policy</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Of course, in that speech Jackson did mention bisphenol A, saying: &quot;Every few weeks, we read about new potential threats: Bisphenol A, or BPA - a chemical that can affect brain development and has been linked to obesity and cancer...&quot; Or, as the\n                        <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em>\n                        sees it: &quot;The first chemical on her list: BPA.&quot;  But, writes MJS: &quot;In the end, though, her agency settled on four\n                        <em>other</em>\n                        chemicals to target first for the action plans.&quot; (emphasis ours)\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        So as MJS says, it\'s true, &quot;first&quot; Jackson did mention BPA. Then she said &quot;pthalates&quot;, then &quot;dioxins,  then &quot;lead&quot; (each once). One of the Journal-Sentinel\'s sources labeled EPA\'s stance as &quot;curious&quot;. I\'m as cynical as anyone, but lets look at Jackson\'s rhetorical choices.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        San Francisco was the first in the nation to attempt action on bisphenol A and phthalates. Jackson was at the San Francisco Commonwealth Club talking to (I guess) some commoners -- not chemists or policy wonks. &quot;Bisphenol A&quot; and &quot;pthalates&quot;, &quot;dioxin&quot;, and &quot;lead&quot; would be recognizable and appreciated by the crowd. True, she didn\'t\n                        <em>explicitly</em>\n                        mention &quot;polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) including the commercial versions of pentabromodiphenyl ether (c-pentaBDE), octabromodiphenyl ether (c-octaBDE), and decabromodiphenyl ether (c-decaBDE)&quot; -- the flame retardants in the first batch of four EPA action plans. But had she, the crowd, eyes glazing over, probably would have slumped into trance instead of thinking the EPA was their friend and ally.

Then did the American Chemistry Council (ACC) really sway the EPA\'s BPA decision in a meeting December 22nd with OMB/OIRA, eight days before the EPA\'s action plan announcement?\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>The Chemical Lobby, BPA &amp; The EPA: Economics Factors?</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        To me, aside from the overly conspiratorial premise of the article, the\n                        <em>Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel</em>\n                        and CPR valuably point the public\'s attention to some enviable industry access. The ACC sent\n                        <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/2070_meeting_122209/" shape="rect">five representatives</a>\n                        to meet with four OMB,OIRA staff; and SABIC, a Saudi BPA manufacturer, sent two.

This is news: If you\'re a chemical lobby group or a Saudi BPA manufacturer, you can get a meeting with OMB/OIRA in a month and a half.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        ACC also submitted a\n                        <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/oira_2070/2070_122209-1.pdf" shape="rect">slim bibliography</a>\n                        (.pdf) of research sources.

Three industry related studies intend to prove that BPA degrades quickly, which is an important criteria for EPA action plans. At least four other studies with various aims are authored by groups sponsored by plastics, BPA or chemical foundations. It\'s true, as the MJS writes, most of the studies authors have industry affiliations. There are hundreds of other studies to choose from which wouldn\'t bolster the ACC\'s arguments one tiny little bit. (Although to be fair, the ACC is a chemical lobby group -- not an unbiased journalist, a point I\'d hope the EPA recognizes)\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        But the ACC included one study from Ryan et al published in\n                        <a href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/114/1/133" shape="rect">Toxicological Sciences</a>\n                        (Online October, 2009), that is an EPA study conducted by EPA employees. This study concludes that low-dose bisphenol A does not alter puberty, fertility, or anatomy and sexual behavior in rats, compared to the estrogen control. Several groups dispute this study because, for one,\n                        <a href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/kfq048" shape="rect">the strain of rat is not as sensitive to low-dose estrogen&quot;</a>\n                        (.PDF Update 02/19/10). However the study\'s sponsoring author has disputed their claims (which are longstanding) to Trevor Butterworth of Stats.org, which has been doing PR on behalf of the bisphenol A industry. We previously discussed Stats.org\'s role in several posts.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        If anything might dissuade the EPA from acting on BPA it would be its own studies (which they didn\'t need the ACC to highlight.) The senior author on the study, L. Earl Gray Jr., also testified before the EPA in 2008, emphasizing that his level of &quot;concern&quot; (an agency measure of potential harm) about bisphenol A exposure was\n                        <a href="http://www.epa.gov/ocir/hearings/testimony/110_2007_2008/2008_0610_leg.pdf" shape="rect">less that his level of concern for phthalates</a>\n                        exposure. Industry groups have touted Ryan\'s and Gray\'s work. If the Ryan and Gray\'s study methodology is in question,\n                        <strike>no activist has been too public about it</strike>\n                        (Update 02/19/10: A letter in Toxicological Sciences\n                        <a href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/kfq048" shape="rect">published 02/17/10</a>\n                        explains the problem with rat strain.) Perhaps more media focus should be placed here, on the EPA\'s own study.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The ACC letter requesting the meeting asks for chemical industry participation in the EPA decision making process (a request that seems rather unnecessary given the easy access industry does have). The letter also asks EPA to &quot;be sensitive to the potential and foreseeable negative effect on the marketplace...the market impact on bisphenol A demonstrates this is a serious and real concern.&quot; Of course this is the primary goal of ACC, to urge the EPA not to impact\n                        <em>any one</em>\n                        of 80,000 chemicals\' markets.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The EPA, in contrast, has said that its priority is to &quot;review all chemicals against safety standards that are based solely on considerations of risk -\n                        <em>not economics or other factors.&quot;</em>\n                        (emphasis ours). It will be interesting to see how the EPA decides on bisphenol A, and whether its considerations to &quot;risk&quot; will include industry consideration to economic factors - or not. However just the fact that OMB and EPA were willing to sit with the ACC lobby group shows a willingness to listen to their (always) economic arguments.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        <strong>The EPA -- Total Pushover?</strong>\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        I don\'t think I\'m particularly naive in these matters, we\'ve been following industry influence on policy for a while, especially BPA, which we\'ve been following since 2005. We\'ve specifically written about EPA apparently backing off of regulation\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2008/03/epa-omb-and-oira-the-biggest-k.html" shape="rect">under pressure</a>\n                        from OIRA/OMB several times before.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        But I\'d be surprised if the EPA turned their intentions for BPA around based on this meeting. First, it appears from their press releases that they had already concluded back in September which four chemicals were first up for action plans.  The idea that they would be so swayed is practically absurd, given the transparently, almost lazily, self-interested documents submitted by industry. Somehow I have more confidence in this EPA then to think they changed action plans based on those almost disrespectful pleas. But they do, now, have their own scientists saying that BPA isn\'t as dangerous as phthalates.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        Clearly the EPA is not quite committed to regulating BPA as activists want. But it has put $30 million towards EPA research. It\'s also conducting its own studies. Hundreds of science studies provide evidence that BPA is harmful, but there are enough impacts from EPA decisions on industry that the agency needs to continue its BPA investigation. However, consider dioxins, another chemical the EPA mentioned in its Commonwealth Club speech. Dioxins are proven to be carcinogenic, a far more damning research finding than has to date been applied to BPA, but the EPA is still struggling to\n                        <a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=209690" shape="rect">contain their use</a>\n                        . On BPA, I\'d be the first to say that there\'s enough research, as would many states and communities. But federal policy-making is not science. So is it more than\n                        <a href="http://acronymrequired.com/2010/02/notes-on-presidents-day.html" shape="rect">poppycock</a>\n                        to suggest that the EPA was
