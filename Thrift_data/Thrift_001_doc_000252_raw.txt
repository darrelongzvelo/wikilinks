In a Galaxy Full, Full of Junk…



Jan 31

Posted by Tim

“What a wonderful smell you’ve discovered!” cried Han Solo to Chewbacca after jumping
down the chute into the trash compactor. Â The compactor was full with Death Star junk and
Han, Chewie, Luke and Leia could barely walk for all the trash. Â Then the creepy dianoga
grabs Luke and the walls start to compact. Â C-3PO has neglected his comm link and death by
pancaking is narrowly avoided! Â (All this while “Ben Kenobi’s Death/TIE Fighter
Attack” begins to play on iTunes!) This might be exaggerated slightly Â but I think that
it represents a very real problem that our planet is facing.

Low-Earth orbit (LEO) and our geosynchronous orbit is becoming increasingly dangerous
because of the many thousands of pieces of debris left over fromÂ jettisoned spaceship
parts, brokenÂ satellites, and other random pieces of junk, not to mention the thousands
ofÂ satellitesÂ already orbiting the planet. Â The sheer amount of debris that is
hanging out in orbit would pose a big threat to the future of space travel, and in particular
space tourism. Â Both of the Republican primary front-runners, Romney and Gingrich, have
plans to ramp up America’s space presence, albeit in the private sector. Â Speaker
Gingrich’s plan involves a sizable space tourism and moon colonization effort by the end of
his second term in 2020 which would mean constant travel back and forth along the Earth-moon
transit.

LEO and geosynchronous satellites around Earth

Every satellite launched into orbit adds another potential threat of collision to a
spacecraft. Â There is also the threat of two satellites loosing communication with the
ground and loosing orbital velocity and crashing into another satellite, or spaceship.
Â Now while an incident like that involving loss of life would at least be sustainable by
NASA or any other government operation, the private sector would not be able to handle a death
in space. Â If a spaceship full of tourists en route to the moon collides with a rogue
satellite or piece of junk and all the passengers are lost chaos would ensue on the ground.
Â Cries for the end of space tourism and stricter debris management would never end!
Â Space tourism might be nixed altogether and space would once again be the realm of
governments only.

I guess the proper Star Wars illustration for how the situation could end up would be from The
Empire Strikes Back when Han, Chewie, and Leia are flying theÂ MillenniumÂ Falcon
through the asteroid field and C-3PO cries, “Sir, the odds of successfully navigating an
asteroid field are approximately 3,720 to 1!” Â While the Hoth asteroid field is not
representative of our solar system’s asteroid field because of the erratic nature of it, it
could one day represent the clutter of space junk collected in our planet’s orbit.

What should be done? Â Well I’m no physicist or engineer at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, but there seems to be a couple solutions. Â One would involve a sort of
“kill-switch” on all new satellites that causes them to fall back to Earth and burn up in
the atmosphere when the ground can’t re-establish communication or if they pose a danger to
other satellites or spaceships. Â A recovery mission would most likely be far too costly
and lengthy, not to mention the risk of handling the defunct satellites or debris.
Â Equipping new satellites with the ability to maneuver away from threatening debris to
avoid collisions is another viable option.

No matter what solution presents itself, it will take a concerted effort from all the
spacefaring nations to address the problem. Â We must take the necessary steps to ensure
the safety of future generations of spaceÂ travelersÂ whether government or private.

A Day of Remembrance



Jan 26

Posted by Tim

Today January 26, 2012 we remember those brave men and women who have died serving their
country. Â I’m not referring to those who’ve died fighting overseas, although a few of
these people have served in the Armed Forces. Â These men and women have courage similar to
those of soldiers but yet courage that a soldier knows nothing about…the unknown.
Â Today is NASA’s Day of Remembrance set aside to honor the brave men and women who have
died in the service of space exploration. Â Forty-five years ago tomorrow astronauts Gus
Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee perished in a pre-launch test before the Apollo 1 mission
caused by a fire in the command module. Â Twenty-six years ago we lost the Space Shuttle
Challenger and all seven of its astronauts when it exploded during throttle-up shortly after
launch. Â Next Wednesday marks the ninth anniversary of the Columbia disaster when the
Shuttle burned up andÂ disintegrated during re-entry over Texas killing the astronauts
on board.

These brave citizens dedicated their lives to the exploration of space and the advancement of
human knowledge, of our planet and the universe. Â They are champions of the human spirit in
their fearlessÂ commitmentÂ to stare into the face of uncertainty and proceed forward
for the goal of human progress. Â Tom Wolfe wrote about the first astronauts and their
character in his book The Right Stuff . Â He said:

But it was not bravery in the simple sense of being willing to risk your life. Â The idea
seemed to be that any fool could do that…No, the idea here…seemed to be that a man should
have the ability to go up in a hurtling piece of machinery and put his hide on the line and then
have the moxie, the reflexes, the experience, the coolness, to pull it back in the last yawning
moment and then to go up again the next day, and the next day, and every next day…there was
something ancient, primordial,Â irresistibleÂ about the challenge of this stuff.

Those were the qualities Wolfe dubbed “the right stuff”. Â Although Wolfe was
referring to the original Mercury Seven astronauts, those traits are still very much the
backbone and the spirit of the astronaut corps to this day.

Although their lives were cut short they wereÂ monumental in their contribution to the
ever growing collection of knowledge of the universe. Â Their value can never be
understated. Â Because of them our universe makes more sense, we continue to push the
envelope, and our space vehicles are safer than they’ve ever been. Â Not a single life in
space was lost in vain. Â As Gus Grissom himself once said, “The conquest of space is worth
the risk of life”. Â Our brave astronauts will always be remembered for their spirit and
courage. Â They embodied the spirit that is truly American, to do something bold and
uncharted for the betterment of their countrymen. Â We can only pray that the next
generation of astronauts and civilians alike reflect the character and bravery of our fallen
heroes.

Apollo 1: Â Gus Grissom Â Ed White Â Roger Chaffee

Challenger: Â Greg Jarvis Â Christa McAuliffe Â Ronald McNair Â Ellison Onizuka
Â Judith Resnik Â Michael Smith Â Dick Scobee

Columbia: Â Rick Husband Â William McCool Â Michael Anderson Â Ilan Ramon
Â Kalpana Chawla Â David Brown Â Laurel Clark

“Unidentified” Flying Nebula



Jan 25

Posted by Tim

Last night I went out with my 15×70′s to do some observing and hopefully Â catch some
Northern Lights. Â While there were no lights, it was moonless so I did get some pretty
quality observing in, specifically in the northern sky in hopes that I would catch an aurora.
Â While I was focusing onÂ Cassiopeia and Andromeda I noticed a small little gray smudge
about one fist length southwest of Cassiopeia. Â I didn’t have my chart with me so I
couldn’t readily identify it without pulling out my phone and blasting my eyes with the
light. Â So I used my Pocket Universe app to try to identify it. Â My best guess is that I was
looking at NGC 7662, the Blue Snowball Nebula. Â I’m not into astrophotography yet so I
couldn’t snap a picture of it, but the best I can describe it would be a gray, slightly oblong
blur to the southwest of the middle section of Cassiopeia. Â Please let me know if I got it
right or wrong. Â I’m most likely buying an Orion Dobsonian very soon so that should shed
some light onto this “mystery”. Â Peace out!

Northern Lights in Your Neighborhood?



Jan 24

Posted by Tim

Tonight, January 24th could potentially stage a quite rare celestial show for the United
States. The solar storm and resulting coronal mass ejection (CME) on the sun is hurtling
hundreds of millions of subatomic particles towards the Earth at breakneck speed. But fear
not! The Earth is well suited to deal with radiation blasts such as these thanks to our spinning
molten iron core which generates a magnetic field around the planet. The particles from the
sun “excite” the magnetic field and glow causing the awe-inspiring show we call the
Aurora Borealis, or northern lights. This is a particularly strong CME, the strongest one
since 2005 to be exact, on a scale of 1-10, this one’s a 9. The sun’s electromagnetic storms
rage in approximately 11 year cycles and the current cycle is due to peak over the next 12-18
months. So this kind of activity will increase in frequency (but only a little in intensity).
The magnitude of this storm will produce very favorable viewing conditions for those living
in the northern hemisphere, particularly those in Canada, northern Europe, the UK, and the
northern half of the U.S. potentially as far south as the Carolinas!

If you’re curious about whether or not you can expect to see some aurora action there is a
helpful map from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) that shows the
predictable range of the auroras. But don’t get all down on life if you live south of the line,
mother nature can misbehave and do things even the best scientists can’t predict so take
heart! If it’s a clear night just head outside and take a look for maybe an hour or so and if
there’s no aurora, you’ll still get some great views of Jupiter, Mars, and Venus! If you
live on the east coast the moon is traversing the sky with the sun today so it will be nice and dark
without the moon so all signs are pointing to a great viewing night! Best of luck to everyone!

Thanks to Bad Astronomy for providing the link to the NOAA page!

GOP Love for Space?



Jan 24

Posted by Tim

Last night the Republican primary scene offered up another crackling debate! Â I say that
with myÂ tongueÂ planted firmly in my cheek. Â I don’t usually enjoy watching
debates because every candidate is a raving egomaniac so the debates are rather farcical in
nature. Â But there was a topic which sparked my interest in this debate. Â The question
came up about NASA and what kind of future does America have in space and how do we fund it?
Â Only Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich were given time to answer the question and they both
said basically the same thing. Â Romney specifically said that the future of space
exploration is critical to the advancement of America because it fuels passion for science
and engineering in youth and the technological advancements made in the space industry keep
our society moving forward. Â He then added that the future of space exploration has to be a
joint venture between government, private sector, and educationalÂ institutions.
Â His view is that we should be leaning towards a more privately funded space program and
that the commercial benefits would help pay for the high costs of innovation. Â He then
stated that our country needs a mission to get excited about again, similar to how President
Kennedy’s challenge to NASA to put a man on the moon before the end of the 1960′s inspired
the whole country, and succeeded. Â Newt Gingrich’s answer, while novel, seemed more
like a cop-out and might have represented a lack of a real plan. Â The former Speaker said
that space exploration should also be more privately funded and that it should be fueled by
prizes. Â He likened this plan to Charles Lindbergh’s flight to Paris for a $25,000
prize. Â I assume he means to use the success of the Â X-Prize plan, beginning with the
Ansari family’s competition to launch the first private spaceship into orbit and
Google’s Lunar X-Prize to send a privately funded and designed robotic probe to the moon.
Â The Ansari X-Prize was a huge success and the Lunar X-Prize is well underway. Â While
this is certainly a novel idea and has seen success, as the envelope is continuallyÂ pushed
further and further, it will require increasing amounts of support from established
agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency.

What this means for NASA is that its days as the marquee space establishment are likely over,
and have been for a while. Â NASA’s budget simply cannot be funded in full at their desired
level of support. Â Although NASA occupies 0.5% of the federal budget, the government
can’t justify sending that much cash towards a program that doesn’t cause people to rely
on the government for their dailyÂ sustenance. Â I think that Governor Romney’s plan
is probably the better of the two as Gingrich’s will likely involve too much reliability on
NASA in the long-run as we get further and further along. Â  If we are going to hand the reigns
of space exploration over to the private sector then what the government needs to do is make a
concerted effort to emphasize science education and specifically physics, engineering,
and astronomy related topics to fuel a passion for space in our nations youth which is sorely
lacking now. Â America was once the leader in space exploration and we’ve let budget cuts
and uninterested citizens slow our progress. Â We should be back on top, maybe not as a
government, but as a nation, with its citizens leading the way to better understand the
universe we live in!

You can read the article on the NASA question from the debate at FoxNews.com .

The Great Venus Transit



Jan 23

Posted by Tim

It’s a rather dreary, depressing day in Baltimore. Â A dense fog hung in the air as I was
making my way to work this morning and that was rather fitting for the mood the entire city was
in. Â After another heartbreaking Ravens loss in the playoffs, my energy Â was sapped
and definitely did not have the motivation to write something on this page today. Â But then
I saw the front page of space.com. Â The headline was about the super rare Venus solar
transit that is set to take place this summer. Â As a budding astronomer I was obviously
intrigued by this event. Â My dad and I are exploring the possibility of building a
telescope together and Mother Nature just put a deadline on our as of yet un-started project,
June 5th, 2012. Â That is the day when our closest planetary neighbor will make a rare
transit across the face of the sun that is visible from Earth. Â This will be one celestial
show you do not want to miss seeing as the next Venus solar transit won’t be until 2117!
Â Surely nobody alive today will be able to see the next one. Â Although the “Great
Venus Transit” will be visible to the naked eye it is definitely not recommended that you
attempt to do so…you’ll go blind! Â The best way to go will be to outfit your telescope or
binoculars with white light solar filters to protect your eyes and any photographic
equipment you may be using.

    But as it stands now I currently have no telescope to view said transit. Â So we must
    begin with all haste! Â Since this is my first attempt at telescope making and mirror
    grinding and all that fun stuff I’m gonna go with purchasing a mirror kit. Â I
    haven’t purchased anything yet but here are some helpful website I’ve used to gather
    information:

    - telescopemaking.org Â  Covers many of the basics of how telescopes function and the
    various kinds of telescopes; basic instructions for mirror grinding and telescope
    assembly

    

    - Mel Bartel’s Amateur Telescope Making Â  Focuses primarily on mirror making and
    all its intricacies

    

    - scopemaking.net Â  Pretty good site with detailed instructions for all phases of
    scope making

    



I’m planning on constructing an 8″ reflector that’s not too big that you can’t
transport it anywhere. Â I will post updates as progress is made along with pictures, and
advice and problems I run into. Â Wish me luck! Â Also best of luck to you as well if
you’re considering building your own scope!

I leave you wish a pic of the last Venus solar transit from 2004. Â The planet appears as just a
dark spot on the sun’s surface but when seen through a telescope the planetary disc becomes
apparent.

The City Dark



Jan 18

Posted by Tim

This makes me so excited! Â There is a new documentary coming out today January 18 from
filmmaker Ian Cheney. Â The new film is called “The City Dark”, and it is dedicated to
raising awareness of the dwindling of one of Earth’s natural resources: Â the night sky.
Â People who love the night sky should absolutely make every attempt to see this film!
Â You can go to theCityDark.com for a list of showings near you. Â I’m going to try to
attend the showing at the D.C. Environmental Film Fest on February 24th . Â If you live in the
Baltimore, MD or NoVa area you should really try to get out for this! Â This film is exactly
what we need to get the ball rolling on awareness of night sky conservation. Â Praise God for
people like Ian Cheney who have a passion for this issue and the means and the talent to do
something about it!

Stop SOPA and PIPA



Jan 18

Posted by Tim

This is off topic and it will be short. Â Today the internet is on strike. Â Many popular
website such as Wikipedia and Reddit which use user submitted content to thrive are blacked
out today in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act ( SOPA ) and the Protect IP Act ( PIPA ).
Â Basically, these laws if passed would give the executive branch of the government the
authority to block or even shut down websites that have potentially Â pirated material
that violates copyright laws. Â This will in effect censor the internet, the only truly
free place left in the world where humans can share knowledge, information, and a video of

How can a government regulate something that is global and theoretically doesn’t exist?
Â What is the internet besides a bunch of invisible 1′s and 0′s that float above our
heads bouncing off of satellites in space? Â Basically, the internet belongs to the world

How Dark is Your Sky?



Jan 17

Posted by Tim

Have you ever seen a truly dark sky before? Â Have you gazed up at the night sky and seen the
Milk Way in all its dazzling beauty? Â Have you seen the staggering splendor of the zodiacal
light after twilight? Â Have you seen the magnificent Messier galaxies and clusters with
your naked eye on the clearest of nights? Â If you are younger than 60 and live within 150
miles of a major city, chances are you answered “No” to each of those questions. Â That
is because of the effects of light pollution, specifically skyglow. Â Skyglow is the
unmistakable “glow” visible in a dome shape that seems to hover above and around cities
engulfed in the effulgent glow of electricity. Â It is remarkable how the tiniest amount of
skyglow can render invisible a large amount of stars at night leaving the brightest objects
illuminated as mere ghosts of their true beauty.

This type of light pollution drives astronomers, professional and amateur alike, insane!
Â It hinders the effectiveness of not only the naked eye, but the most sophisticated
telescope, it masks the fierce beauty of the night sky, and hampers the scientific pursuits of
the amateur star-watcher.

Aside from its adverse effects on astronomy, light pollution also is a huge energy waster !
Â I touched on this earlier in my post on Dark Skies , but it’s worth mentioning again that
over illumination in the United States is responsible for approximately 4-5 million barrels
of petroleum per day in energy wasted! Â Our light-loving lifestyle is highly inefficient
and wasteful and is damaging our health and the environment as well. Â If you are passionate
about night sky preservation visit the folks over at the International Dark-Sky Association
. Â They have many resources available to make efficient and night sky-preserving
lighting possible.

If you want to know the extent of the light pollution where you live you can obviously just look
outside on a clear night. Â You can also use this chart published by Sky & Telescope Magazine
in 2001. Â The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale ranks the varying levels of dark sky based on the
ability to see certain celestial objects and the visible magnitude of those objects.
Â This chart describe the classes of dark sky as outlined by John Bortle. Â (**Note that
this chart is from Wikipedia; I would have linked to it here but as Wikipedia will be blacked out
globally tonight to protest the SOPA and PIPA acts in the U.S. I’ve provided here. Â This
graphic belongs to Wikipedia, I do not own this graphic nor have I had anything to do with its
creation). Â Sorry if the chart doesn’t quite fit on the page, here’s a link to the
original article in Sky & Telescope.

That being said, go ahead and use this chart to find out which class your home falls in. Â If it
falls in classes 1-4 get out there tonight and do some stargazing! Â If you’re like me and
most likely live in a class 5 or 6, well my binoculars are easy to transport to someplace darker
which is quite often the case when I use them. Â Please feel free to comment on your night sky
conditions where you live so we can all come over your house and have a star party! (only if you
live in a 4 or above

Â Enjoy!

  Class Title Color key Naked-eye limiting magnitude Stellar limiting magnitude (with
12.5″Â  reflector ) Description 1 Excellent dark-sky site black 7.6â€“8.0 19 at
best Zodiacal light ,Â  gegenschein , zodiacal band visible;Â  M33 Â direct
visionÂ  naked-eye Â object;Â  Scorpius Â andÂ  Sagittarius Â regions of
theÂ  Milky Way Â cast obvious shadows on the ground;Â  airglow is readily
visible;Â  Jupiter Â andÂ  Venus Â affectÂ  dark adaptation ; surroundings
basically invisible. 2 Typical truly dark site gray 7.1â€“7.5 17 at best Airglow
Â weakly visible near horizon; M33 easily seen with naked eye; highly structured summer
Milky Way; distinctly yellowish zodiacal light bright enough to cast shadows at dusk and
dawn; clouds only visible as dark holes; surroundings still only barely visible silhouetted
against the sky; manyÂ  Messier Â  globular clusters Â still distinct naked-eye
objects. 3 Rural sky blue 6.6â€“7.0 16 at best Some light pollution evident at the
horizon; clouds illuminated near horizon, dark overhead; Milky Way still appears
complex;Â  M15 ,Â  M4 ,Â  M5 , andÂ  M22 Â distinct naked-eye objects; M33 easily
visible withÂ  averted vision ; zodiacal light striking in spring and autumn, color still
visible; nearer surroundings vaguely visible. 4 Rural/suburban transition green
6.1â€“6.5 15.5 at best Light pollution domes visible in various directions over the
horizon; zodiacal light is still visible, but not even halfway extending to theÂ  zenith
Â at dusk or dawn; Milky Way above the horizon still impressive, but lacks most of the finer
details; M33 a difficult averted vision object, only visible when higher than 55Â°; clouds
illuminated in the directions of the light sources, but still dark overhead; surroundings
clearly visible, even at a distance. yellow 5 Suburban sky orange 5.6â€“6.0 15 at best
Only hints of zodiacal light are seen on the best nights in autumn and spring; Milky Way is very
weak or invisible near the horizon and looks washed out overhead; light sources visible in
most, if not all, directions; clouds are noticeably brighter than the sky. 6 Bright suburban
sky red 5.1â€“5.5 14.5 at best Zodiacal light is invisible; Milky Way only visible near
the zenith; sky within 35Â° from the horizon glows grayish white; clouds anywhere in the sky
appear fairly bright; surroundings easily visible; M33 is impossible to see without at
leastÂ  binoculars ,Â  M31 Â is modestly apparent to the unaided eye. 7
Suburban/urban transition or Full Moon red 4.6â€“5.0 14 at best Entire sky has a
grayish-white hue; strong light sources evident in all directions; Milky Way invisible; M31
andÂ  M44 Â may be glimpsed with the naked eye, but are very indistinct; clouds are
brightly lit; even in moderate-sizedÂ  telescopes Â the brightest Messier objects are
only ghosts of their true selves.At a full moon night the sky is not better than this rating even
at the darkest locations with the difference that the sky appears more blue than orangish
white at otherwise dark locations. 8 City sky white 4.1â€“4.5 13.5 at best Sky glows
white or orangeâ€”one can easily read; M31 and M44 are barely glimpsed by an experienced
observer on good nights; even with telescope, only bright Messier objects can be detected;
stars forming familiarÂ  constellation Â patterns may be weak or completely
invisible. 9 Inner-city sky white 4.0 at best 13 at best Sky is brilliantly lit, with many stars
forming constellations invisible and many weaker constellations invisible; aside
fromÂ  Pleiades , no Messier object is visible to the naked eye; only objects to provide
fairly pleasant views are theÂ  Moon , theÂ  planets , and a few of the brightestÂ  star
clusters .

Mars Images app

Smartphones really can do some amazing things! Â The latest app I downloaded to my iPhone is
the Mars Images app from NASA’s JetÂ Propulsion Laboratory. Â It uses the comm uplink
from the long-lived Martian rover Opportunity and downloads them directly to your phone or
tablet! Â How cool is that?! Â The Opportunity rover is currently “hibernating”
during the harsh Martian winter but there is a pretty large cache of images already stored.
Â There will also be the opportunity to see images from JPL’s newest rover Curiosity when
it arrives on the Red Planet in August. Â You can download the app for your iOS device Â or
Android .
