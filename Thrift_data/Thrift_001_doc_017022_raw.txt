Ends justify the means



One of my favorite hobbies is correcting misperceptions of utilitarianism. I came across one
the other day at this website . The author, Kerby Anderson, introduces us to utilitarianism,
analyzes the philosophy, and later critiques it. Letâ€™s skip right to the criticism:

Kerby Anderson: There are also a number of problems with utilitarianism. One problem with
utilitarianism is that it leads to an “end justifies the means” mentality. If any
worthwhile end can justify the means to attain it, a true ethical foundation is lost. But we all
know that the end does not justify the means. If that were so, then Hitler could justify the
Holocaust because the end was to purify the human race. Stalin could justify his slaughter of
millions because he was trying to achieve a communist utopia.

Andersonâ€™s assertion that utilitarianism leads to an
ends-justifies-the-means-mentality is correct, but the rest of the paragraph is not.

Utilitarianism posits that not only do the ends justify the means, but that they are the only
thing that could . There is no other standard by which means are judged than the ends they bring
about.

Before we go further, I must point out that I am using the term â€œendsâ€� as
synonymous with â€œconsequences,â€� which is how I believe â€œendsâ€�
is understood in this context. However, when Anderson speaks of â€œendsâ€� in this
paragraph, he clearly does not mean â€œconsequencesâ€� but rather
â€œgoals,â€� which are wholly different.

But notice how Anderson describes utilitarianism earlier in the same essay:

Kerby Anderson: Philosophers refer to it [utilitarianism] as a “teleological” system.
The Greek word “telos” means end or goal. This means that this ethical system determines
morality by the end result. Whereas Christian ethics are based on rules, utilitarianism is
based on results.

His introduction of the etymology of the Greek root â€œtelosâ€� is confusing
rather than illuminating because it appears to conflate consequences and goals. Under
utilitarianism, an act is judged by the end state it brings about, not by the goal of the actor.
Anderson makes this clearer later in the paragraph, but in so doing confuses the reader by
supplying two contrasting descriptions of a single theory in consecutive sentences.

Why is this relevant? Because it makes all the difference when evaluating the rightness of
Hitlerâ€™s holocaust or Stalinâ€™s purges.

Anderson says utilitarianism would allow Hitler to justify the Holocaust because he had
noble goals. Let us grant that Hitler did indeed have noble goals. So what? Utilitarianism
does not care about goals, it cares about results, as Anderson himself says in the essay. Did
the Holocaust increase utility or not? That is the question that concerns utilitarians, and
no sane utilitarian would say that it did.

The same is true for Stalinâ€™s murders. Does it matter that he was trying to achieve a
communist utopia? No. If he had brought about a utopia, could he justify his acts under
utilitarianism? Yes, assuming the utopia produced enough happiness to compensate the
unhappiness caused in its creation. What I will say is that to the extent an act brings about
happiness, that is an argument for the act. Likewise, if the act requires the infliction of
suffering (which the Great Purge did) that is an argument against it.

The problem with Hitler and Stalin was not that they employed immoral means to achieve noble
goals. It was simply that they did not count all the “ends.” And yet, that is all the
difference there need be between laudatory and condemnable acts.

Anderson continues:

Kerby Anderson: The end never justifies the means. The means must justify themselves. A
particular act cannot be judged as good simply because it may lead to a good consequence. The
means must be judged by some objective and consistent standard of morality.

Sure, happiness is difficult to measure precisely, but that does not mean it is entirely
subjective. We have some idea of what tends to make people happy: family, friends, winning at
Settlers of Catan, and we have an idea of what makes them unhappy: loneliness, hunger, root
canals.

Anderson ends his piece by commenting that utilitarianismâ€™s chief flaw is that it
â€œattempts to provide a moral system apart from God’s revelation in the Bible, but in
the end, it does not succeed.â€� Utilitarianism is no doubt an improvement over
Godâ€™s revealed morality in the Bible, but then again, thatâ€™s not saying very
much. About these ads GA_googleAddAttr("AdOpt", "1"); GA_googleAddAttr("Origin",

    I don’t know, Andy. If Hitler had succeeded, I guess the Israeli’s wouldn’t be
    oppressing the Palestinians.

    I don’t think utilitarianism says that “right” and “wrong” are necessarily
    based on the observed actual outcome. Those terms have their use — praise and blame —
    in shaping future moral behavior — and intent is very much relevant. If an action
    could’ve reasonably been expected to produce a good outcome based on the agent’s
    knowledge (the intent), then it may be praiseworthy (or at least not blameworthy)
    regardless of the outcome. The feedback (“right” and “wrong”) is also
    forward-looking. The results of the instance are less important than those of similar
    instances that might come in the future.

    “Under utilitarianism, an act is judged by the end state it brings about, not by the goal
    of the actor.”

    Prior to acting, it can only be judged by what we expect it to bring about, which might
    otherwise be called the “goal”. And in trying to influence people’s future
    decision making, we face the problem of them acting under the same circumstances. When I
    tell someone it is the “right” thing to do to do act so as to maximize utility, I am very
    much talking about their goals. I am telling them what sort of goal they should have.

    Thanks for the comment, David.

    I donâ€™t think utilitarianism says that â€œrightâ€� and
    â€œwrongâ€� are necessarily based on the observed actual outcome. Those
    terms have their use â€” praise and blame â€” in shaping future moral behavior
    â€” and intent is very much relevant. If an action couldâ€™ve reasonably been
    expected to produce a good outcome based on the agentâ€™s knowledge (the intent),
    then it may be praiseworthy (or at least not blameworthy) regardless of the outcome.

    I’m a little confused why you put “the intent” in parentheses after knowledge,
    insinuating that they are similar if not the same. I’ve always understood
    “intent” to mean “what you want to have happen,” and it’s not clear what
    connection this has to knowledge. Could you make this connection more explicitly for me
    so I can understand it?

    Prior to acting, it can only be judged by what we expect it to bring about, which might
    otherwise be called the â€œgoalâ€�. And in trying to influence
    peopleâ€™s future decision making, we face the problem of them acting under the
    same circumstances. When I tell someone it is the â€œrightâ€� thing to do to do
    act so as to maximize utility, I am very much talking about their goals. I am telling them
    what sort of goal they should have.

    I see your point. When I used the word “judge” I meant it in the sense of
    “evaluate,” as in “evaluate the results of.” Ultimately, the results are what
    will be of interest to other people faced with similar situations. It could be the case the
    actor made the best choice with the information he had, but it turned out poorly, perhaps
    because he had bad information.

    Maybe this discussion is about whether we should term that act “immoral.” If the
    purpose of morality is to serve as a guide to our actions, then I’m in favor of calling it
    immoral, so that other people will not make the same mistake of relying on that bad
    information.

    For instance, was bloodletting immoral? At the time it was practiced, perhaps people
    could not have known it was so bad, as we know it to be today. We could say the same for lots of
    ancient medical practices that seem crazy nowadays. I’m less interested in
    condemning the ignorant doctors of that era than I am in ensuring their mistakes are not
    repeated. And if that means that we call their acts “immoral” then I’m for it.

    When I tell someone it is the â€œrightâ€� thing to do to do act so as to maximize
    utility, I am very much talking about their goals. I am telling them what sort of goal they
    should have.

    Absolutely. Nevertheless, the goals are tangential to what we care about, which is
    utility. So telling someone to have “maximizing utility” as their goal is one way of
    increasing the likelihood of maximizing utility, but may not even be the most effective
    way. Perhaps we could be more effective if we told people to care about making money,
    which, although not our real goal, had the effect of causing people to produce lots of
    goods that made them rich and made other people happy.

    By intent there, I meant to indicate what the actor expected to happen.

    You are still talking about *their* goals then.

    We do care about goals, but we care about them in a probabilistic sense: how likely they are
    to maximize utility. That’s true for all of our heuristics.

    That is different from caring about goals for their own sake, which is what Kerby Anderson
    suggested utilitarianism is about.

    “We do care about goals, but we care about them in a probabilistic sense: how likely they
    are to maximize utility. Thatâ€™s true for all of our heuristics.”

    How can one consider goals probabilistically without considering the effects that
    might be produced by such goals? One can compare the goals to other goals that have already
    been executed, but then one is considering effects (and ignoring the fact that no two
    situations are going to be the same, thus it is imprudent to try and adjust the probability
    when one has no objective knowledge of the appropriate manner in which to do so).

    Also, what about cases where one’s goals fail but the results end up being more
    beneficial than they would had the goals succeeded? It seems inaccurate to say that one
    can decide on the goals after one’s seen the effects: unless you’re a politician,
    this tends to be seen as affirming the consequent…

    It is easy to create a buck. It is a lot tougher to make a difference.

    Business is never so healthy as when, being a chicken, it has to perform a degree of
    scratching around for the purpose it gets.
