Five favorite expanded score albums or box sets of 2008

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SVx24SEdQJI/AAAAAAAAAr8/qvYuxu4m8FA/s400/superman-changes.jpg

5. Superman: The Music (Film Score Monthly)

This staggering eight-disc set compiles the scores from all four Christopher Reeve Superman
movies and contains a beautifully designed mini-book filled with exhaustive liner notes.
The expanded discs of the Ken Thorne scores from Superman s II and III were probably the main
reason why Superman completists dove into savings that they otherwise reserve for their
mortgage payments for their Luthor-owned condos in order to pay for this pricey set ($120!). I
never liked Thorne's scores (the orchestra budget in II and III was clearly slashed, so
Thorne's rearrangements of John Williams' music sounded tinny and undernourished). For me,
the real previously unreleased gem of the set was the disc containing Ron Jones' energetic and
underrated music from Ruby-Spears' decent '80s Superman animated series. Jones' Superman
cues sound like the cues he later wrote for Star Trek: The Next Generation 's "Best of Both
Worlds" two-parter, which TNG showrunner Rick Berman reportedly disliked because he
preferred the music on his show to sound boring.

4. They Live: 20th Anniversary Edition (AHI)

Obey. Consume. This expanded release of the bluesy score from John Carpenter's sharpest and
cleverest post- Thing flick is your God.

3. Blazing Saddles (La-La Land)

The only previous times any of the music from Blazing Saddles was made available were when
Elektra/Asylum included three songs from Saddles on the 1978 High Anxiety soundtrack LP and
when "I'm Tired" made its CD debut on Rhino's 1998 Warner Bros.: 75 Years of Film Music box set.
The release of the cues from John Morris' short but fantastic score to the Mel Brooks
classic--another one of my favorite movies--was long overdue. All the major cues are on
there, including the Count Basie Orchestra's performance of "April in Paris," which is to
black cowboy music what Jay-Z's "Roc Boys (and the Winner Is)..." is to black superhero music.

2. Shaft Anthology: His Big Score and More! (Film Score Monthly)

FSM's Shaft set marked a couple of milestones: the first-ever release of the film versions of
Isaac Hayes and J.J. Johnson's score cues from the first Shaft installment (the 1971
Enterprise/Stax soundtrack album was a re-recording) and the CD debut of Gordon Parks'
Shaft's Big Score soundtrack. Though the release was actually sent to the pressing plant for
manufacturing three weeks before Hayes' death , it ended up being the illest way to honor his

1. Batman: The Animated Series (La-La Land)

Unlike previous superhero cartoon shows, B:TAS didn't recycle the same four or five score
cues or repurpose creaky old library music. Shirley Walker, one of the few female composers in
the business, and her B:TAS team composed an original score for every episode. Their use of a
full orchestra made other animated action shows look like that pathetic El Mariachi musician
character who prefers a synthesizer over bandmates. Sadly, Walker didn't live to see the
release of her lovingly crafted music from B:TAS (before her death in 2006, only her score from
the Mask of the Phantasm spinoff movie was released). She would have been thrilled about La-La
Land's two-disc set , which is dedicated to her and compiles scores from 10 B:TAS eps,
including Harley Quinn's debut ep, "Joker's Favor" (pictured above). I've been a fan of B:TAS
since its 1992 premiere, so I've waited 16 years for a release like this. I never said thank you,
La-La Land. And then La-La Land will probably say the following in that Batrasp that sounds
like a cross between a whitened-up Keak da Sneak and a Muppet: "And you'll never have to."

Eartha Kitt (1927-2008): She was an awful good girl



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SVSNC7Qc7jI/AAAAAAAAArM/CDx3OWXQcEQ/s400/eartha-kitt-santa-baby.jpg

Sheldon: That poster of Halle Berry is a little unnerving.



Howard: So don't look at it.



Sheldon: She's like my fourth favorite Catwoman.



Howard: No kidding.



Sheldon: Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfeiffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.



Howard: What about Lee Meriwether?



Sheldon: Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.



Howard: Well I'm glad that is settled.



Sheldon: That makes Halle Berry my fifth favorite Catwoman. It's Julie Newmar, Michelle
Pfeiffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether...



Howard: Please, I'm begging you. Go to sleep.



Sheldon: I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.



-- The Big Bang Theory



Sheldon also forgot about Adrienne Barbeau (the voice of Catwoman on Batman: The Animated
Series ) and Gina Gershon (she assumed the role in 2004 on the imaginatively titled animated
series The Batman ). Sheldon's third favorite Catwoman, legendary "Santa Baby" singer
Eartha Kitt , has died at 81 from colon cancer on the holiday that was the subject of her
signature song.





Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SVSNTmBFPMI/AAAAAAAAArU/JyPYTq97yyg/s400/eartha-kitt-as-catwoman.jpg

Kitt was the purrrrrfect replacement for Julie Newmar when the statuesque dancer/actress
was unable to continue playing Batman's most formidable female foe on the '60s series because
she was busy filming MacKenna's Gold . No other Catwoman could purrrrr or grrrrrowl like Kitt
did. How fitting that the role was assumed by someone named Kitt.



Who can forget when Kitt purred one of the greatest lines in an Eddie Murphy movie that weren't
spoken by Murphy ( "Marcus, darling... I don't have any panties on..." )?



Kitt led an amazing life. She was a civil rights activist who was blacklisted for criticizing
the Vietnam War and its negative effect on minorities and more recently, she expressed her joy
over Senator Obama's rise as a presidential candidate ("It's one of the most wonderful things
that can happen to this country") and supported her countless gay fans on the issue of same-sex
marriage.

She goes on to say that the gay marriage issue is similar to what African-Americans
experienced during the time of the Civil-Rights Movement. "We were not allowed to go through
certain doors because of our race, our color," she says intensely. "It was so stupid that we
were not able to sit at the counter of a restaurant because it was only for Anglo-Saxons. It's
stupid when this country says it was born on "freedom for all," but it's "freedom for some"!
This Christmas is a bittersweet one due to the news of her passing on the day when she
suggestively invited Kringle to "come and trim my Christmas tree." I usually get creeped out
by songs that try to sex up Santa like he's the hero of a Judd Apatow movie, but Kitt's rendition
of the frequently covered "Santa Baby" is awesome. Her version was the first version and it's
still the sultriest.

My three favorite holiday traditions return tonight



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SVEeq8UvDnI/AAAAAAAAArE/fhbvCE0D21U/s400/paul-shaffer-jay-thomas-and-darlene-love.jpg

For me, Christmas ain't Christmas without three things: 1) Paul Shaffer doing his hysterical
impression of Cher singing "O Holy Night," 2) Jay Thomas telling an anecdote about an
encounter with Lone Ranger star Clayton Moore, followed by Thomas trying to knock a giant
meatball off the top of a Christmas tree with a football, and 3) Darlene Love performing
"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)."



One of the suckiest things about the writer's strike was that it led to Late Show with David
Letterman not being able to do its annual Christmas edition last year. Tonight, Cher and her
muff, Thomas and Love are back. Posted by

An Oakland Raider busts out the Carlton Dance

I'm not a fan of the Silver and Black, but the highlight of yesterday's Raiders/Texans game
amused me: Raiders wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins* celebrated a touchdown by doing the
illest shout-out to a sitcom I grew up watching . His choice for an end-zone dance was the
hilarious Carlton Dance from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (photo by Brant Ward of the San
Francisco Chronk ).





Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SU-4n_B4StI/AAAAAAAAAq0/bNoNGCpW4Gk/s1600/johnnie-lee-higgins-carlton-dance.jpg

Before he played Carlton, Alfonso Ribeiro was best known for his slick dance moves on Broadway
and in commercials with Michael Jackson back when he was black, so it's funny that Ribeiro's
most famous dance move today is a much less slick-looking move in which he had to pretend to be a
less skilled dancer. The Carlton Dance is a parody of what has to be the whitest-looking dance
ever. Every rhythmically challenged white person in the '80s did it, from Bruce Springsteen
and Courteney Cox in the "Dancing in the Dark" video to the clubgoers at the Tech Noir in the
original Terminator .





Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SU-41xzCTlI/AAAAAAAAAq8/GoBNTNEdZF4/s400/fresh-prince-carlton-banks-150x208.jpg
Whenever Ribeiro would bust out the Carlton Dance, everyone in the studio audience would lose
their minds. Twelve years after the last time Carlton shook his ass back and forth to Tom Jones'
"It's Not Unusual" on NBC, that dorky dance still makes crowds lose their minds, judging from
yesterday's reactions from the Raider Nation, the TV sports reporters and the blogosphere.



-----



* When Higgins scored another TD, he bust out what SacBee blogger Jason Jones (not the
soon-to-be-ex- Daily Show correspondent) called "one of Big Daddy Kane's patented dance
moves." After the game, JLH identified this second dance as the "Hooka Hooka." He also did the
Humpty Dance for a TV sports reporter in the locker room. The guy's got quite an arsenal of
end-zone dances. A hater said on a message board that JLH's "idiotic dances need to be
penalized." Looks like Reverend Shaw wants to expand his anti-dancing crusade from Bomont to
the NFL. Posted by

Batman: The Animated Series soundtrack: A Walker to remember



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-em-lflt0LJU/UAZ4CH2iZWI/AAAAAAAAEfY/v-qEaZH_K3Y/s1600/batman-tas-on-leather-wings-grappling-hook-firing-540x405.jpg
As a fan of Batman: The Animated Series , I've waited 15 years for the score cues from the
groundbreaking show to be released on an album. Now the wait is finally over, thanks to La-La
Land Records' Batman: The Animated Series score compilation , which the label released as a
limited edition two-CD set on Tuesday (a week after Warner Bros. Records double-dipped the
Dark Knight soundtrack with additional score cues). I'll be adding some of the music from
La-La Land's release to rotation on A Fistful of Soundtracks' "Assorted Fistful" block.



Modeled in tone after Tim Burton's somber-looking, dark-humored Batman films but much more
faithful to the comics, Bruce Timm's B:TAS was the first American superhero cartoon show that
felt cinematic. B:TAS writer/producer Paul Dini, who scripted the landmark, Emmy-winning
Mr. Freeze revamp "Heart of Ice," says in the soundtrack liner notes that the show's crew
constructed each episode like a mini-movie.



The B:TAS crew must have heard Peter Bogdanovich's anecdotes about how Samuel Fuller
mentored him during the making of the low-budget 1968 thriller Targets ("Never think about
limitations! Only think about what you want!") because like Fuller, they clearly didn't let a
TV budget stop them from doing what they wanted. They brought a cinematic approach to
everything, from the way they paced the dialogue-- B:TAS ' minimal and terse dialogue was
different from other superhero cartoons, especially the '90s Marvel shows, like Saban's
X-Men and Marvel Films Animation's Spider-Man , which had nonstop, hurriedly delivered,
Speed Racer -ish dialogue--to the original score music. Unlike past superhero cartoons,
B:TAS didn't recycle the same four or five score cues or repurpose creaky old library music.
Shirley Walker and her team of B:TAS composers, which included Lolita Ritmanis and Michael
McCuistion, composed an original score for every ep and used a full orchestra at a time when
most other animated action shows relied on chintzy-sounding, cost-saving synthesizer
music.



Danny Elfman's B:TAS main title theme, a reworking of his own brooding and dashing-sounding
main theme from the Batman movies, set the tone for the show's "dark swashbuckler" sound.
Walker, who conducted Elfman's 1989 Batman score and worked for him as an orchestrator, wrote
a new eight-note theme for the Batman character that sounds equally thrilling and kickass. It
eventually supplanted Elfman's theme in the opening titles when Warner Bros. Animation made
B:TAS into a feature film ( Batman: Mask of the Phantasm ) and then brought the show back to the
airwaves under a new title, The Adventures of Batman & Robin .



Walker and her composers crafted a different motif for each villain. Mr. Freeze was
accompanied by a mournful waltz (which can be heard during the 14-minute "Gotham City
Overture," track 1 on the first disc), Two-Face was represented by an eerie soprano recorder
melody ("Harvey's Nightmare/Dent's Soap Box" and "Bruce Wayne's Nightmare/Two-Face
Remembers"), and the Penguin received a lumbering brass theme to match his bluster ("Birds of
a Feather").



The Joker is such a beloved adversary that Walker gave him not just one but two motifs, a
carnival-style melody and a secondary "Fanfare for Rocky"-style crime spree theme that was
used only during the "Last Laugh" ep . The liner notes refer to the Joker's "Last Laugh" crime
spree theme as "a hip-hop jazz theme," but it doesn't really sound like hip-hop. It's a
middle-aged white person's idea of what they think a hip-hop beat sounds like. As an FSM Board
poster says, it's more rock/funk than hip-hop. Still, Walker's "Last Laugh" theme is a lot of
fun, and like all the other cues, I'm jazzed to finally have it on disc.





Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SUpOtG7JJiI/AAAAAAAAAqc/tV0JVRa1fyI/s400/batman-the-animated-series-cd-cover.jpg
After a solid film and TV score career that saw her alternating between the Timmverse and James
Wong/Glen Morgan productions ( Space: Above and Beyond , Final Destination ), Walker died in
2006 and didn't live to see her B:TAS material get the kind of release that La-La Land has
devoted to it. Though this release is loaded with over two hours of music, it's missing
Walker's memorable Catwoman theme from "The Cat and the Claw, Part I," the first B:TAS ep that
ever aired , Carl Johnson's lively score from the excellent "Beware the Gray Ghost" ep with
special guest voice Adam West , and McCuistion's Lawrence of Arabia -style epic score from the
"Demon's Quest" two-parter , which gives me hope about a Volume 2 from La-La Land.



The final track on the La-La Land album is a fitting tribute to Walker, in which she gets to
finally speak, via an archival recording of her explaining her eight-note Batman theme and
playing it in different variations on the piano. The subtle differences between each
variation--like when Walker alternates between a somberly played second half of the theme
and a more uplifting second half--are incredible. They show how much care was put into the
music and the show itself. Posted by

New AFOS episode: "Spirit of '99"



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SUcbaMEb_sI/AAAAAAAAAp8/EKbK__s9bIU/s400/office-space-copier-beating.jpg

Because this is episode WEB99, the show will consist of selections from scores to the most
noteworthy and inventive films of the year 1999 , including Office Space , Election , Fight
Club and a film I like a little less than the other three but Laurence Fishburne was such a badass
in it: The Matrix . John Frizzell's score for Office Space was never released, so Office Space
will be represented here by Canibus and Biz Markie's closing credits shout-out to Johnny
Paycheck, "Shove This Jay-Oh-Bee."



"Spirit of '99" begins streaming tonight at midnight and repeats tomorrow and Thursday at
4am, 10am, 3pm, 7pm and 11pm, Wednesday at midnight, and Saturday and Sunday at 7am, 9am, 11am,
1pm, 3pm and 5pm.

WEB100 will be the last AFOS episode in the current format



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SUb_7e1-4YI/AAAAAAAAAp0/U5ZkqT4T7c4/s400/iggy-pop-bored.jpg

I've decided to end A Fistful of Soundtracks: The Series after producing and hosting 100
episodes for the AFOS channel since January 2003.



Yep, I'm cancelling my own show rather than letting the bastards who run... Oh, wait a minute,
I'm the bastard who runs the channel. All by myself. Never mind.



This doesn't mean I'm going away for good. It just means I'll no longer be doing shows under the
AFOS: The Series title and format. My voice will still be heard on the channel and I'll continue
to be "announcing song titles and making cracks, even if [it] is pre-recorded!," as one
listener said to me about my voice in an e-mail a few years ago. (I'll still stream the earlier
eps too. Ep WEB63, which is called "Feel the City Breakin'," is the earliest ep that doesn't
make me cringe when I play it back.)



The time has come to switch to a new format for my on-air self, like the less constricting and
more new releases-oriented "AFOS A-Go-Go" format I experimented with in September and
November. I should have given the program a name change a long time ago. Having both the program
and the channel share the same A Fistful of Soundtracks name confuses listeners who appear to
be under the assumption that AFOS is a 24-hour program as opposed to a 24-hour channel. (I
originally conceived AFOS as an audio archive of continuously looped episodes from my
program's terrestrial radio years. But I found myself going in another direction, and that
was to diversify the programming--without veering too far off from the channel's film/TV
music format--and make AFOS sound more like an actual radio station, hence my interspersing
of themed blocks like "The F Zone" and "Soda and Pie" with newly recorded eps of AFOS: The Series
.)



In each AFOS ep, all the film or TV score tracks are connected by a certain theme, like most
recently, Batman villains or monster movies . I've gotten tired of doing that
one-theme-per-ep format. Writing the copy for each of these themed eps takes me forever to do.
I often get hit with writer's block. Writing copy for a show in which the tracks don't have a
unifying theme--like during "A-Go-Go"--is much easier for me.



Plus I'm not a creature of habit. I get bored with routine after awhile. I became bored with my
last job after a couple of years (but I stayed with it for a few more years because the money was
good). As for my job before that one, I got bored with it after about half a year (plus having to
type your newspaper articles inside an office building that lacks air conditioning kind of
puts a damper on your morale).



In the case of AFOS: The Series , which was a way for me to continue doing the same program I used to
do on terrestrial radio in the late '90s and early '00s, you could tell when my interest in it
started to taper off--when the program went from weekly to monthly to bimonthly to
whenever-the-hell-I-feel-like-it-ly.



I've lately been listening to the kickass Scion Radio channels programmed by L.A.'s Root Down
club and KCRW's Garth Trinidad. For his channel, GT records about two and a half hours of
content and then has them looped over and over again for the entire month.



I'm thinking of switching to a format like the Root Down crew's or GT's, except instead of
recording new segments once every month like they do, I'll do it probably every other week or
whenever I can find time to get on the mic or whenever I have any space left on my hard drive.
Morning Becomes Dyspeptic and the DJ-less "Assorted Fistful," "Soda and Pie," "Chai Noon"
and "F Zone" blocks will remain on the AFOS schedule so that listeners won't have to hear so much
of my annoying voice (listeners have told me they don't mind my voice, like the person in that
aforementioned e-mail, who said, "I've *gasp* ventured into other soundtrack stations.
They aren't as fun to listen to as Fistful though... There's something nice about having
someone announcing song titles...").



Here's what coming up on AFOS: The Series : Ep WEB99 will flash back to the year 1999 and stream
selections from scores to the most memorable films that were released during that standout
year for cinema. And then like 100 Bullets , I'm ending it at 100. The final ep under the AFOS: The
Series title and format will be a doozy: all 22 official Bond opening title themes in
chronological order.



If you frequently listen to the channel, thanks for choosing AFOS.

Have you played The Venture Bros. today?



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SUJVLdYkwCI/AAAAAAAAApk/lg5ZTB2SESU/s400/venture-bros-season-3-and-wave-twisters-covers.jpg
The Venture Bros. Season 3 DVD and Blu-ray packaging's '80s Atari video game cartridge
box-style design rocks. It reminds me of the Activision-style design for the 2002 DVD cover of
DJ Qbert's Wave Twisters .



The box sets' street date is March 24. Why do I have to wait so damn long until I can finally delete
last season's Venture Bros. episodes from my DVR?

Arriving at retail as a two-disc box set on both platforms for the suggested retail prices of
$29.98 and $44.98, respectively, The Venture Bros. Season 3 features all 13 uncensored
episodes from the show's highly popular third season and bonus material including deleted
scenes and commentary. Additionally, the Blu-ray disc box set will be packaged with an
exclusive CD which includes 20 tracks that comprise the full musical score from the
television series' third season. [Via TVShowsOnDVD.com ] Posted by

The five greatest fake names from TV



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SUGIHizGbNI/AAAAAAAAApM/wvA9E-qBQhY/s640/the-wire-fuzzy-dunlop.jpg

These overly fake-sounding names for imaginary personas always end up being used either by
bands (there's a British metal band that's actually called Cletus Van Damme) or message board
posters (on the Film Score Monthly boards, I post under a fake name from The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air ). They're all easier to pronounce than Blagojevich, a name that must be giving late
night talk show hosts anxiety attacks.



1. Fuzzy Dunlop

Herc's fake CI on The Wire . Sometimes The Wire is funnier than most sitcoms.



2. Shecky Shabazz

A stage name the Fresh Prince creates at the last minute for his wack stand-up act.



3. Rafael De La Ghetto

A legendary street poet made up by the Fresh Prince to impress the shawties, with some help from
Geoffrey the butler: "Cannon to the right of them, cannon to the left of them, cannon in front of
them, volley'd and thunder'd! "



4. Cletus Van Damme

One of The Shield 's few running gags: an alias only Shane would come up with.



5. Santos L. Halper

The credit card account name Bart Simpson winds up with after he applies for a card as Santa's
Little Helper. Posted by

The other Jimmy Aquino



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/ST_inCHII0I/AAAAAAAAAo8/sWAd66p6Tog/s400/jimmy-aquino-from-cni-and-kristin-chenoweth.jpg

There are two Jimmy Aquinos on the blogosphere and on Web radio: me and Comic News Insider
co-host Jimmy Aquino .



My hair is close-cropped. He has long hair. I live in California (and can't wait to leave it). He
hails from New York. I host a film and TV score music show that attracts nobody. He hosts (with
Joe Gonzalez) a comic book review podcast that attracts guests like Brian K. Vaughan, Greg
Pak, Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion, Patton Oswalt, Rosario Dawson and more recently, Kristin
Chenoweth (see above). I'm studying to be a voiceover actor. He's acted on stage for several
years. I'm a total recluse. He's not. Family members have called me either "Jim," which I went
by when I started out writing for newspapers, or "J.J." because my middle initial is J. His
middle initial is P. Despite all those differences, it's easy to mistake him for me or vice
versa because we share the same first and last names, we're both Pinoy and we dig the same
geekish stuff.



We've known of each other and we might have walked past each other a few times during my first and
so far only visit to the San Diego Comic-Con in 2007, but we've never met face-to-face.



That's going to change soon. We will finally meet face-to-face in the studio, on a date yet to be
determined.



Mark your calendars and start coming up with some sort of elaborate escape plan because the day
of my guest appearance on CNI is the day when the world will end. You see, the East Coast Jimmy is
really my future self--sometime in the future, I will get sick of my middle name and change it
and grow my hair out--and if the two Jimmy Aquinos meet, it will create a paradox that will tear
apart the space-time continuum and destroy the universe. In other words, a shitstorm that's
worse than all two seasons of A Shot of Love with Tila Tequila .



Jimmy invited me to be a guest on his fun podcast after I confirmed that in April, my first piece
of comic book writing, "Sampler," will appear in Secret Identities: The Asian American
Superhero Anthology , a graphic novel that he blogged about back when its editors were seeking
story ideas . He saw his friend Heidi MacDonald's recent BEAT post --in which she linked to my
blog and said she's amazed to learn that there are now two Jimmy Aquinos in the comics
world--and then contacted me earlier this week about going on CNI to discuss "Sampler,"
Secret Identities , A Fistful of Soundtracks, our favorite comics and which network TV execs
we want to put contract hits out on.



(On the latest episode of CNI , which is available here , Jimmy gives me and AFOS a nice
shout-out. Joe jokes that I'm CNI Jimmy's future self, which is made funnier by the fact that
I'm actually younger than Jimmy, who's celebrating his birthday during this ep. I don't know
Jimmy's age, but I'm pretty sure I'm younger than him.)



My visit to CNI will be my first-ever guest appearance on a podcast or talk show (outside of a
couple of occasions when I dropped by KSJS-FM's Celluloid Dreams back in my newspaper days).
It will also be the first in a special series of shows in which the CNI hosts will mess with
listeners' minds. The following week, Jimmy, Joe and Blair Butler will welcome to the studio
both Vanessa Williams from Ugly Betty and Vanessa Williams from the Soul Food TV series and
grill them about who should be Bruce Wayne's successor as Batman. Posted by

De La Hoya/Pacquiao 24/7 : "Filipinos, they're a very clingy people"



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_msb7eQA-RFY/SToKAP6KdUI/AAAAAAAAAoc/QdzxmBmG2cs/s640/manny-pacquiao-with-filipino-flag.jpg

Well, my mom and some of my relatives are clingy. Not me. I'm a Pinoy who craves his me time. So I
guess that makes me more like Manny Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach , who said the above
funny quote about Pac-Man's huge entourage in De La Hoya/Pacquiao 24/7 .



The four-episode HBO series about the advent of De La Hoya/Pacquiao Fight Night is my current
favorite docu-show. Maybe it's because I'm Filipino, but seeing Filipinos get this much
non-Basco brother airtime on American TV is awesome, despite the overabundance of footage of
the poorest Filipino areas, as the PinoyLife blog has noted with snarkiness ("Please... film
some Pinoys in Manila that are near some offices, universities, and malls"). (During the
weight challenge sequence with Pacquiao's entourage, I loved how I could overhear an
entourage member saying, "Excited ko !" That's a line I don't hear everyday on HBO. The only
Tagalog that's uttered on HBO is during Return of the Jedi , for Christ's sake.)



There's some terrific documentary filmmaking on display in De La Hoya/Pacquiao 24/7 too. The
sequence about Pacquiao's Catholic upbringing and his charity work was masterfully shot and
edited. The cutaway from Pacquiao's mother to the People's Champ finishing his prayer in the
gym was beautifully done. I haven't enjoyed a boxing doc this much since When We Were Kings .



A Slate.com reviewer wrote that De La Hoya/Mayweather 24/7 lacked "what When We Were Kings had
in spades: historical importance to match the spectacle... the stakes of the fight are much
lower than the promotional bluster would lead you to believe."



But the stakes are incredibly high with this fight, for both the 35-year-old, over-the-hill
De La Hoya and his younger, shorter and faster opponent, whom I'm rooting for and whose
triumphs in the ring have uplifted "an entire anguished nation," to borrow Geologic's words
from his review of the docu-show. If Pac-Man wins this fight, it will uplift us even more.
Filipinos everywhere will not show up for work on Monday. If you run a hospital, you can forget
about those bedpans being emptied on Monday because your nurses will be out celebrating.



"Farmer Johneric breaks down Pacquiao vs. De La Hoya" [PinoyLife]

"Thoughts on HBO's 24/7 De La Hoya – Pacquiao | Episode 1" * [PinoyLife]

"Filipino Masculinity & Infidelity Through Manny" [FOBBDeep]



* Funniest line from the PinoyLife recap: "Buboy, Buboy, Buboy. You have the wackest name in
the history of Filipino athletics. I'm sure that Manny appreciates all you do being his
confidant, his friend, and cornerman. To most of the Filipino Americans reading this site,
you're kinda like Too Big MC with Manny being MC Hammer." Posted by

Minority Militant header sketches

Below are my sketches for a header I designed for the Minority Militant , a Laotian American
blogger and activist from Chi-Town whose posts I've enjoyed reading. He riffs on Asian
American-related topics ranging from the ugly racism that's often on display on reality TV to
President-Elect Obama's Asian staffers .



Props to TMM for giving me my first job--even though it was a small one--after I lost my regular
job earlier this year. TMM has been digging my black-and-white webcomic, The Palace , which I
created to keep myself busy (I've been posting the comic here on A Fistful of Soundtracks: The
Blog), so he asked me to draw a new header for his blog.



The sketch of the Asian brother in the hoodie emblazoned with "TMM" is the final version of the
image on the header, which can be seen on TMM's blog in all its fully inked, cleaned-up and Paint
Shop Pro-and-Photoshop-enhanced glory.

        Jimmy J. Aquino

    

        (uh-kee-no)

        

        I run A Fistful of Soundtracks, an Internet radio station that streams music from
        film and TV scores.

        

        To log on to AFOS, press play on the widget above or go here .

        

        This blog isn't just about score music, which is fun to stream but can be boring to
        write about. It's also about my favorite music outside of score music--they're what
        many of us view as the soundtracks to our lives--and films and shows that are worth
        discussing and sometimes contain music that receives airplay on AFOS.

        

        In 2007, I came up with the premise for "Sampler," a short story in the 2009 New Press
        graphic novel Secret Identities: The Asian American Superhero Anthology .

        

        "The way they make movies is insane. Cold Mountain ? There were black soldiers
        fighting in that war, so why are there these little pickaninnies running around like
        little slaves? They are messing with history. Give us our due. And what about with
        Pearl Harbor ?… A film based in Hawaii and there's not one Hawaiian?…
        Mississippi Burning ? Mississippi ain't never burned, but L.A. has--three
        times."--Paul Mooney (2004)
