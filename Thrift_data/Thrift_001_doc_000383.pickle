We\'ve had some changes and made great progress since the previous edition of this paper. First, we have a new Magisterium. Here is the new member list and votes for/against:\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    12-1 Antracia\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    8-5 Anur-Sanur\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    10-2 Bolshikstan\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    12-1 Dyr Nasad\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    11-2 Cloudous\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    10-2 Infinite Loop\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    13-0 Kelssek\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    11-2 Lowbrook\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    12-0 Warr\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    11-1 YaM\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Everyone who ran for the office was elected. Some of the citizens of TEP, however, did have some issues with the way that Infinite Loop acted during his campaign. In order to make ammends, he immediately resigned from the office.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Here are the results of the votes on various proposals:\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Provost</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Warr was elected as Provost and Dyr Nasad was elected Provost Pro Tempore through a power sharing deal. There was a tied vote, and, at the time, there was no way to deal with such a situation.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Warr-4 votes\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Dyr Nasad-4 votes\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Law Regarding Tied Votes in the Magisterium</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    This law passed with 6 votes FOR, 1 vote AGAINST, and 2 did not vote. This law, created by Dyr Nasad and Warr, states that, it the event of a tie in the Magisterium, the proposal will be brought to the general populace in a referendum. If the citizens\' votes are still tied, then the casting vote will be given to the Conclave, the court of TEP which always has an odd number of members.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Appointment of DFD as Arbiter</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    This motion passed with 7 votes FOR, 0 AGAINST, and 2 did not vote. The Conclave must always have an even number of members, and Arbiters cannot run/hold the positions of Magister or Delegate simultaneously. Infinite Loop gave up is position as Arbiter when he ran for the Magisterium. DFD said that she was willing to take his place. After a minor incident concerning DFD\'s past in the Empire, she easily passed the Magisterium.\n    <b>Good luck DFD!</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Amendments to Standing Orders</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    This motion passed with 7 votes FOR, 0 AGAINST, and 2 did not vote. This ammendment, created by Kelssek, made a few minor, but needed, changes. This allowed the Provost the choice of appointing a Provost Pro Tempore only if he/she believed that he/she needed help (previously, the Provost had to appoint a deputy) In addition, it slightly changed the voting process. Previously, a vote only required two motions. Now the Provost must sign off on any vote.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Office of Tourism and Recruitment</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    This motion passed with 7 votes FOR, 0 AGAINST, and 2 did not vote (anyone else seeing a pattern?). This proposal, created by Dyr Nasad and Infinite Loop, presented the idea that the Office of Tourism and Recruitment should be created. This was created primarily because TEP sees a constant outflux of nations into other regions, and it wishes to retain all the nations that it can. The Director of the Office of Tourism is an appointee of the Delegate, and can choose deputies as he/she sees fit. The first ever head of this office, titled the\n    <b>Officer of Tourism</b>\n    , is Dyr Nasad.\n    <b>Good luck to Dyr Nasad!</b>\n    (yes, I\'m wishing myself luck)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>From the Office of the WA Liason</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    By Dyr Nasad, on behalf of Drakkengard, WA Liason\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Here is a list of how The East Pacific voted on the various WA Resolutions since the previous issue of this newspaper.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>The Right to a Lawful Divorce</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted AGAINST with 1 vote FOR and 6 votes AGAINST. The prevailing opinion AGAINST was that divorce was not an issue that the WA should be involved in. Decision: The resolution The Right to a Lawful Divorce was passed 2,833 votes to 1,807, and implemented in all WA member nations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>The Landmine Convention</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted FOR with 7 votes FOR and 4 votes AGAINST. The prevailing opinion FOR was that landmines injure too many civilians. Decision: The resolution The Landmine Convention was passed 2,766 votes to 1,405, and implemented in all WA member nations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Repeal &quot;Nuclear Arms Possession Act&quot;</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted AGAINST with 1 vote FOR and 9 votes AGAINST. The prevailing opinion AGAINST was that the Nuclear Arms Possession Act only gives WA nations the right to possess nuclear weaponry. If this was repealed, then non-WA nations would have a distinct advantage when fighting a WA nation. Decision: The resolution &quot;Repeal &quot;Nuclear Arms Possession Act&quot;&quot; was defeated 2,758 votes to 2,373.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Access to Life-Saving Drugs</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted AGAINST with 1 vote FOR and 5 votes AGAINST. The prevailing opinions AGAINST were that it was awkwardly written and that it was anti-capitalist. Decision: The resolution Access to Life-Saving Drugs was passed 3,269 votes to 1,183, and implemented in all WA member nations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>WA Environmental Council</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted AGAINST with 0 votes FOR and 5 votes AGAINST. The prevailing opinions AGAINST were that this resolution was too weakly worded and that it had prematurely blamed industry for environmental issues. Decision: The resolution WA Environmental Council was passed 2,832 votes to 1,390, and implemented in all WA member nations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>WA Labor Relations Act</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted AGAINST with 3 votes FOR and 4 votes AGAINST. The prevailing opinions AGAINST were that this issue was not the WA\'s responsibilty and that it harmed WA nations\' economies. Decision: The resolution WA Labor Relations Act was passed 2,682 votes to 1,661, and implemented in all WA member nations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Reduction of Abortion Act</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted FOR with 6 votes FOR and 1 vote AGAINST. The prevailing opinion FOR was that most nations couldn\'t find faults in the resolution. Decision: The resolution Reduction of Abortion Act was passed 3,166 votes to 1,516, and implemented in all WA member nations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Repeal &quot;World Assembly Economic Union&quot;</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted AGAINST with 0 votes FOR and 5 votes AGAINST. The prevailing opinion AGAINST was that isolationist policies hurt everyone. Decision: The resolution Repeal &quot;World Assembly Economic Union&quot; was passed 2,963 votes to 1,204.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Right of Emigration</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted AGAINST with 3 votes FOR and 6 votes AGAINST. The prevailing opinion AGAINST was that the resolution was written very badly. Additionally, almost every nation found something wrong that the other nations didn\'t notice. Decision: The resolution Right of Emigration was passed 3,011 votes to 1,673, and implemented in all WA member nations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Law of the Sea</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    TEP voted AGAINST with 2 votes FOR and 7 votes AGAINST. The prevailing opinion AGAINST was that the resolution tried to enforce the WA\'s will on non-WA nations. Decision: The resolution Law of the Sea was passed 3,348 votes to 1,065, and implemented in all WA member nations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>New Members of TEP\'s Forum</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    By Dyr Nasad\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Here is a list of the new nations on TEP\'s forum.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    name, (post count)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Magisters</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Dyr Nasad (792), YaM (779), lowbrook (25)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Citizens</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    ultharambassadorbarbara (128), Tokka Wokka (5), Powerhungry Chipmunks (3), Imstar (1)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Members</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    President John Henry Eden (29), Andromeda Islands (27), Fiona Somerset (9), Neasmyrna (8), Carami (7), TripleKo (6), Expansive Esophagus (6), KillJoy Grey (5)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Spartzerina (2), Kekova (2), Most Great Britannia (2), kareybarey (2), Drock Borien (2)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Jahka (1), East Islington (1), Pacificstania (1), Pershall (1), Kazaman (1)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    PROA (0), brillen (0), comunnism (0), Fluffy Black Cats (0), Napam (0), Brook Grey (0), kiket (0), Meckra\'sFinest (0)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>The Quiz</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    By Dyr Nasad\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    You\'ve made it this far!

Our\n    <b>debate contest</b>\n    has ended  - the winner being Finavarra of the region Liberty Alliance placed first, with Naivetry of Equilism placing second and The Monkye also of Equilism placing third! Many congrats to those who participated and to those who have placed! And, to keep in tune with being the\n    <b>most democratic feeder in NationStates</b>\n    , our\n    <b>Magisterium</b>\n    has a new look, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve survived another election and things look to be active once again in our hallowed halls. Our\n    <b>Halloween</b>\n    \xe2\x80\x93 organized by Der Fuhrer Dyszel - went well too.

Well that\'s more like it! Let\'s read on!\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>TEP in general</b>\n    has undergone a few changes recently! Right off the bat our newspaper has received a bit of a face-lift! If you remember our last issue, back in December, it was a Christmas issue with a crazy little rendition of a famous Christmas poem, along with some current events both in the region and in our roleplay speckled in and around the issue, ending with a humor section and a little bit about how to set up an embassy in our hallowed halls. This issue is noticeably different! For one, it\xe2\x80\x99s immediately better in that it\xe2\x80\x99s written by multiple authors, hence multiple opinions and various different sections, teeming with raw, unedited thoughts brought to you by citizens from all walks of life in our region. We\xe2\x80\x99re down with the free speech. But, there\xe2\x80\x99s more, much more! And, if you act now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take 1,000 off the price right now, no money down! Bad credit? No credit?

We also have a new Conclave, approved by our Magisterium, and these Arbiters of The East Pacific are currently hashing out\n    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://z1.invisionfree.com/forums/The_East_Pacific/index.php?showtopic=8049" shape="rect">Standing Orders</a>\n    in the hopes of drumming up some protocol for trials and interpreting laws, you know, because we\xe2\x80\x99re all about trying hard criminals! Well\xe2\x80\xa6 not really. We\xe2\x80\x99re actually a friendly bunch, a friendly bunch that talk on the regional message board as well as the off-site forum, and pretty much get along OR ELSE!! Nah. We\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to get ticked at one another, of course. But in general, we have the sense of a community. And you can\xe2\x80\x99t have community with out unity!

And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the heart\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess that would make the Conclave the prefrontal cortex, the spum the various viruses and bacteria, and the WA voting the voice of the region. Backing up again, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably better to remain off course instead of take the scenic route. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the East Pacific Treaty Organization\n    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://z1.invisionfree.com/forums/The_East_Pacific/index.php?showtopic=7708" shape="rect">resume talks</a>\n    and attempt to form a United Nations among our nations, but lo!

While that\'s obvious to anyone who knows anything about NS, what with it being one of the five feeders, I don\'t mean simply that. It\'s got a large fairly active population. With the 4th highest number of regional nation population in the whole of Nationstates, it\'s a behemoth. And with that sizable population comes a latent alienation and a bit of anonymity. Players are easily allowed to do what they want so long as they don\'t do it to excess. They can choose to show their head in the community or ignore it. They can be roleplayers, gameplayers, or people who\'re just hanging around for stuff like the stability and the WA stuff.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    It\'s a nice size, as if even a small group decide to do something they can help the region be clean of adspum, and all sorts of other things. But it\'s also a bad size. With the leviathan population TEP has, it\'s hard to get to know all of your fellow TEPers, or even a few of them. More than simply that, it\'s hard to get to know your leaders, and the movers and shakers within TEP. While there\'s other ways that we could improve the community, I think one of them is to make the community more aware of it\'s hard working citizens.

In the end, I rejected The Empire, helped establish ASBS as delegate then Todd as delegate and stayed around in the community because I enjoyed the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n      <br clear="none"></br>\n      <br clear="none"></br>\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI see.

If so, then is it true my role in the Empire [and my good friend Terasu\'s role] could make me a traitor to the TEP government I helped establish after it\'s fall?\xe2\x80\x9d\n      <br clear="none"></br>\n      <br clear="none"></br>\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAny attempt to try to prove regional member\'s involvement in The Empire as being a sign of treachory has and will continue to fail.  All of us who joined The Empire to better TEP have remained in TEP and continued to contribute to the region.  It is what it is today because of our dedication to the region.

I honestly dont know what feeder I came from, but I have always said the East Pacific. I had a knack for wandering off into other regions though, and I experienced many different sides to opinions on the overall game.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The most interesting experience by far though, is the ideals of raiders and my little journey with a region called Nazi Europe.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I joined the region a while back, looking at their debates mostly at first. The fact they were condemned caught my eye most of all. It seemed they were condemned on their ideology, and for me that was silly. I have always disliked other countries or regions getting branded for something they may or may not believe in. In this case, it was apparent why Nazi Europe was condemned, because no one likes Nazis and what they stand for. That is of course understandable.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    However, the accusations leaned more towards the fact that they were spouting their beliefs off to others, and causing commotions.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Upon researching this, I found that it wasnt true. They were in fact branded simply for what they stood for. But here is the real thing that bugged me.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I joined them, became a part of their military(raider style), and I learned very well that none of them really believed in the ideals of Nazism that existed during WWII, the ideals they were branded for. The leader himself could care less, when I spoke with him. They were merely facist/socialists, who liked to raid.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    And I enjoyed raiding so I saw no issue with this at all.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Its very curious how they wore a mask, stuck in the land of &quot;RP Mode&quot;.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    They are condemned sure, but its more like a badge.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    You see, the problem I have with this condemning nonsense, is that it seems to always borderline personal opinion about others. It seems someone gets upset about another region or nation, and want them to get condemned just because they dont like what they think.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I find it far worse to operate in such a manner, rather than the personal manners of the accused.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Nazi Europe wasn\'t at all a bad region, they were just simple raiders. Because of the political battles I had with so many at that time, I become a hater of the somewhat new Security council. And it was only because people spouted off opinion and political bias more than anything else.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Ill never forget the liberation attempt, by someone who was a raider themselves, because they simply couldn\'t stand by when their enemies took a region. So they cry and go boo hoo to the council and create a huge issue and liberate the region.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    And you know what?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The region is dead again just like it was before the raiders, and liberation.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    After seeing this, I came to the conclusion that the security council was essentially pointless, and it choked the game play of raiders.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    NS isnt alive as much as it seems, and raiders play a role in the game to keep it alive, and it creates things for regions and nations to do in a sometimes boring environment.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Sure, the ideals of raiding isnt a popular one, but it also keeps the game alive.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    So why choke it, and make so many huge political deals about it in the council?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Regarding that I am at a loss.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I dont mind that it certainly does create alot fuss, because that does lead to more activity, but at the same time it hurts those who play a different game within NS as well. But then one asks or comments, that raiders are bad and shouldn\'t do this or that, blah blah. Yes, Ive heard that, but what strikes me is that most, not if all regions raided nowadays are DEAD regions. Why liberate? Why complain?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    You are just making it dead again through political fuss, only to recreate a cycle of inactivity and boredom. Congratulations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I learned this all from simply dealing with alot while in Nazi Europe.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I eventually left though, because of things going on in my life of course, but my real place has always been in TEP. I am glad though that I can say I was once a raider and I still support the idea of raiding.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Its an unliked activity, but it sure beats sitting around like old men in a region doing nothing but passing pointless resolutions to already fine governments.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    And don\'t even get me started on that, I had enough fun dealing with bureaucracy and utter boredom as a Senator long long ago in TWP. That was truly a moment in NS where I wanted to punch the region with my fist, because no one wanted to do practically anything but sit around to simply explain it. However that was long ago and maybe its different today.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Concerning other things though, we need a cheese and tea party around in TEP.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I am very much yearning for one.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    ~The Angel of Death\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    [align=center]\n    <b>\n      <font size="7">The Game.</font>\n    </b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Alejandro the Pengiun</i>\n    [/align]\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font face="American Typewriter">\n      <i>\n        Epic awesomeness has just entered the building.

But there\'s one catch- they\'re still voting on who should become Provost, and it\'s ticking me off.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    For starters, at the time of which I wrote this column the score was at 3 even- three for incumbent Dyr Nasad, three for challenger Free Pacific States, and three abstaining. The Magisterium has ten people this term. If someone votes abstain, something tells me we\'re screwed.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Why? If someone votes abstain, then no one is really elected. To further complicate matters, there is no official legislation describing what to do when the elections for Provost are tied, or when abstaining is the most popular option. That means nothing is legal, nor illegal; it\'s a crossroads.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Since people failed to elect me to the Magisterium, I\'m going to give something- and this is just a suggestion, people- from outside the forum. Here it is:\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>If abstaining is the most popular option, have both members become co-Provosts.</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I know, I\'m probably going to get shot for this. But let\'s go further- one Provost oversees debates, and the other oversees votes. One represents the Magisterium to the Arbitorium and the Delegacy, and the other is in charge of the archives. Epic compromise has been reached, and problem solved.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Then again, if one or the other gets the most votes... then I\'m happy, and we can move on.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Another thing that has been ticking me off about the Provost elections is the amount of time it is taking. It\'s been very long, and long enough to elect a Provost. I think they should have stopped it at 5 days, then selected the winner there, which would have been FPS.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    But since my opinion is insignificant, I\'ll shut up now.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    [align=center]\n    <b>\n      <font size="7">TEP Entertainment</font>\n    </b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Penndale</i>\n    [/align]\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Falling</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    When you fall, you flap your arms up and down like a little birdie just learning how to fly.

It\'s a lot of attention to detail - which I can do, willingness to be flexible - which I\'m trying to learn, and it involves counting - which I am not at all gifted with and never claimed to be.

My great thanks to the citizens who voted in record numbers since the enactment of Concordat.  And my gratitude to other Arbiters and the Admin team who selflessly and behind the scenes help make elections possible - and legitimate.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    As for bumpy, there was a reprimand and a spanking.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Q:  It\n    <i>wasn\'t</i>\n    always legitimate?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    A:  I can only speak for me as Viceroy.  The first election of Magisterium I supervised was relatively bump-free.  Delegate election is always going to be a bit of a sticky wicket.  It\'s an invitation for troublemakers to do what troublemakers do.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Thanks to the Admin team, a watchful eye (think Sauron) was placed upon our democratic process and at the discretion of Viceroy, two hopefuls were denied nominations.  One of those nominees now faces a trial for treason in Conclave.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Q:  Are trials exciting?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    A:  If you like watching paint dry.  Well not exactly, the legal interpretations we wrestle with are interesting - at least to me.  It\'s where wise minds agree to disagree, then walk away without pouting.  That\'s refreshing.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    As for a treason trial, dunno.  Never did one yet.  It\'s certainly a high crime and could get you banned from the region and forum for over 9,000 years.  It will be exciting if there\'s both a prosecution and a defense.  Less so if we try them in absentia.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Q: Whut?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    A: Trials in TEP aren\'t automatic.  A citizen raises an issue of fact or law.  If Conclave accepts the case, then parties are invited to participate.  They can and do waive a defense to the matter, either by stating so or not showing up.  In Absentia means you get tried without showing up.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Not showing up doesn\'t mean we just drop it, particularly in the instance of high crime.  Conclave\'s duty is to the region and its law.  If it can be shown that someone tried to disrupt an election or hack the electoral process, I have faith that my fellow Arbiters will make the right decision.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Q: There was a challenge to your vote count.  Were you asleep at the switch or just drunk?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    A:  That wasn\'t very nice.  I said I was bad at numbers.  The fancy craquelure texture of the forum background doesn\'t make page breaks as easy to see as I\'d like.  So I kinda missed a second page of the vote.  Well not kinda, I just did.  I\'m a marine mammal for gosh sakes.  You should see what I gotta do to manipulate a computer mouse.  But it\'s all good because Allegheny won by a respectable margin and it meant that more citizens voted, which was great success.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    As for the absentee ballot challenge\n    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://z1.invisionfree.com/forums/The_East_Pacific/index.php?showtopic=8394" shape="rect">here</a>\n    , I think Packilvania isn\'t a sore loser, just a smartypants.  The thread is so funny I\'m afraid to lock it because it cracks me up.  Humor can be healing.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Q:  I noticed in election headquarters you have a large console with several screens and a lot of controls and flashing lights.  Is that how you monitor elections?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    A:  Lord no.  I had EM install that to keep Todd out of trouble.  The controls do nothing but trigger a rerun of Spongebob on that screen there and Todd seems to be soothed by flashing lights.  He\'s a valued and thoughtful contributor in Conclave as an Arbiter, but he\'s twitchy so we give him the &quot;console of doom&quot; for the election and he works his special magic on it.  Which means essentially he\'s occupied.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    It\'s all good here at election central.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font size="7">\n      <b>Minute in Roleplay</b>\n    </font>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>By Fyrdowsi</i>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Courtesy of The Fyrdowsi Spy News Network\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Water, Water, Everywhere: Water Pressure and Mental Pressure Combines in The New International Sealab</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy recently was briefed on a recently built sealab in the waters of the central seas. With collaboration from the Divine Knowledge inventors, he had installed a remote eye sub-system into a combat suit that was destined to be tested by an Order of the Hourglass disciple. The disciple plunged into the high seas in order to discover more about the lab, and The Spy got a really good view of what\'s going on in the deep waters, all thanks to the combat suit.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The sea laboratory facility was hosting a number of fascinating visitors, each with their own dark secret. After hitching a ride from a passing submarine, the disciple climbed aboard the lab to meet a plethora of scientists and other figures of various shapes and sizes. Delegates from the nation of Vekaiyu were the first to populate the area, followed by those from Smigsachenweiz, Allegheny, Moafin and other interested nations.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Intrigues and conflicts brewed up naturally as these different elements of the region mixed up. The disciple bore witness to the unusual closeness of the delegates from the non-human humanoids nations who bonded well together, perhaps because of their inhuman shapes. Diving in the deep waters seemed to be the main attraction for those originating from landlocked nations, even though muddied vision, creepy underwater artifacts and dead people in the waters made the underwater area a poor choice for a merry dive.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    From his vantage points above secluded pipes and ventilation holes, the disciple silently watched on as trouble brewed even among citizens of the same nation. In hopes of finding out more about each nation, the disciple proceeded to test the combat suit capability by planning to absorb the genetic fingerprints of the foreign citizens. Unfortunately, The Spy forgot to tell him earlier that some of the systems in the suit were still infested by bugs. Thus, misfortunes abound when the disciple tried absorbing the genetic fingerprints of the Vekaiyu delegate, and turned into a little fox kit. All hell broke loose when a delegate from Allegheny suddenly went berserk and bludgeoned his own partner to near death. He also went on a murderous rampage against everyone. His rampage was partially stopped when a mysterious earthquake suddenly rocked the facility and threw it into darkness.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy\'s connection with the disciple was cut when the earthquake happened, but an uninterrupted stream of communication between the suit and its Divine Knowledge creators was still present, indicating that the intrigues in the waters was not yet over. The Spy advised all his readers who planned to visit the facility, to bring some humanitarian aids and keep a lookout for any Allegheny submarines leaving the area.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Military, Meetings and Drunk Men: Clandestine Gatherings Gets Going in Connections</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Upon hearing the gossip about the congregation of several top brasses of several countries in the state of Allegheny, The Spy sent one of his best students on an eavesdropping mission to discover the intentions of the meeting. The clues led the wandering disciple to a sleepy bar in a yawning town called Pittsburgh, where he found the group already ranting on and on about stuffs. Masquerading himself as a plain acne-riddled teenage waiter, the disciple watched in plain view as the guys and girls gossiped about the nations around them.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Who would believe that Vekaiyu was in fact in a state of disorder? The Spy discovered that the foxy queen of Vekaiyu was being held in asylum (a mask word for \'being ousted from the throne\') for some reasons, despite everything the media want us to believe. The news unwittingly slipped from the foxy lips of a certain vulpine princess. A certain old delegate was also spotted talking about the invasion of the small island nation Dyr Nasad without any shame or favor, although the suggestion seemed to be not in the interest of the young upstart vulpine princess.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    It seemed that Allegheny was in full knowledge of the meeting; the President of the nation itself was there all along, drinking and making merry with the group. A certain military woman, obviously attached to Allegheny\'s defense, was also there as well, probably as a safety measure. Talks about purchases of Vekaiyu\'s coastal areas were mentioned by the Allegheny groups, signifying a possible military strategy, or maybe just new private waterfronts for the President\'s pleasure.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Perhaps the most commanding presence in the meeting was a delegate from Mahanoy. He was seen reprimanding the vulpine princess many times. He was also spotted jeering at Allegheny\'s military girl with a certain suggestive gesture. The disciple also noticed him fidgeting with unease from time to time as the meeting went on, a trademark signs of a possible agent provocateur for another organization other than his state.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    It wasn\'t that long before the formal meeting turned into a merry boozing session, where an obviously intoxicated Mahonian delegate openly wooed the Allegheny military girl. The disciple decided to end the espionage session there, handed over the gin to the delegate, and went back to the headquarters.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy deduced from the report that conflicts would be imminent on the central region of the East Pacific due to this private warmongering session, and advised his readers to beef up their security.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Reach for the Sky: Individuality against Assimilation in Ascension</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy received news from the sky demons patrolling the sky that a huge wave of Packilvanian Hive fleet was spotted entering the planet\'s atmosphere. The situation was too grim and dangerous for his inexperienced disciples to spy upon, so The Spy himself took to the sky and sailed through the air. Under the Cloaking sacred word, of course.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy switched on his listener device and listened to the sounds from the various nations. It seemed that the nation of Free Pacific States was the first to notice the strange occurrence of a Hive ship entering the proximity of the planet. The nation has sent warning signals to other nations allied to itself, but it was not known if the message would reach the others in time.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The nation of Reziel apparently was busy thinking on how to tackle the space-based offensive with terrestrial defenses. It seemed that the nation lacked any space technology at all, though it was too early to say that such thing would be detrimental to their safety.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Diplomatic approach apparently was a primary objective for East Malaysia; this was evident from the flurry of diplomatic messages exchanged between the nation and the Pax recipient. Despite that, it was apparent that violent conflict was inevitable as soldiers started filling up the streets in East Malaysian cities, under the watchful eyes of The Spy.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy tried to lock on to the nation of Allegheny\'s sound waves, but he could get only the Allegheny national anthem blaring all across the channels. Military activities was obvious all across the nation though, even from The Spy\'s observation post high up in the sky of Allegheny.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    It seemed to be awfully quiet in Vekaiyu, though. The Spy could get only peaceful messages and awkward silence through his listener. It was quite strange to see the nation, who was embroiled in sectarian conflicts for years, to have light response to such dangerous issues.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Drakkengard was up and running as usual, paving the way for the Hive fleet. The Spy has received a highly encrypted message leaked from the Drakkengard communication system. It seemed to be an image of a Pax representative. Carried along in the message was a series of speeches promising this and that to the Drakkengard nation.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy narrowly missed being hit by a wave of Kandarinese fleet going upward to the sky. Each individual ships seemed to be going to a specific destination a good distance away from each other. The Spy assumed that the nation of Kandarin might have employed a specific strategy against the incoming Hive fleet. The Spy did not notice anything strange about the formation until the first flick of flame emerged on the Tassalvaltan fields. By then, the nation of Kandarin seemed to be using the scorched earth tactics to hinder the progress of Pax forces.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The atmosphere was getting too crowded for The Spy to continue surveying, so he decided to descend to land for safety reasons. The Spy advised his readers to continue beefing up their security in anticipation of Pax forces\' movement.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font size="7">\n      <b>Interview with Allegheny:</b>\n    </font>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Todd McCloud / Allegheny</i>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>What are some of the things you want to accomplish during your term?</i>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I am not looking to do anything radical in my term of office, really what I was running for was to keep TEP stable and keep that sense of openess and togetherness that TEP really stands for. (At least to me anyways.) My real goal is to try and arrest the drama that has been coming up lately and to foster an era of communication between prominent members and new members alike. As for the actual gameplay side of things, It\'s pretty clear what I want to do and that is to keep the TEP Government a well oiled machine, keep those legislators legislating, voting on WA matters the way the region wants me to and to keep our conclave active to ward off security threats and from what I have seen of the amazing men and women of TEP Government, it shouldn\'t be to hard of a task.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>What did you do prior to coming to TEP?</i>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    My NS history isn\'t very long and it\'s quite boring actually compared to TEP delegates of old.

It has it\'s origins in the loose collections of tribes, kingdoms and fiefdoms descended from the ancient Nahrinese tribes who emmigrated from what is now modern day Dannistaan to their current location. For several centuries, the Nahrinese fought one another, content that each deserved their own patch on their somewhat insignificant island. This resulted in a patchwork of around 150 kingdoms.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    It was around the 17th century that the benefit of a more cohesive nation came to the fore. The few larger tribes started to amalgamate the smaller groups by various means. Some by diplomacy, some by trade, most by sheer brute force. This ultimately lead to a dramatic reducation of of the 150 kingdoms to around 36 in the 18th century. The remaining 36 kingdoms ultimately proved too large, initially, to conquer each other. This resulted in the equilibrium that resulted in all the kingdoms deciding to unite into what became known as the Nahrin Kingdoms.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Nahrin Kingdoms pooled together their economic as well as diplomatic resources to draw in international trade. It provided opportunities for goods to be exported as well. The liberalisation of trade did not allow for the liberalisation of civil rights though, as even the most light hearted jokes at the Joint Monarchies of Nahris resulted in severe punishment, usually an almost immediate beheading or an unappealable lengthy sentence. This carried on until the early 20th century where the toll of international wars and famine proved too much for the people.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Change was promised by one leader within the Trans-National Imperial Nahrin Army, the combined land armed forces of the Nahrin Kingdoms. The officer, a General Alan Theodore Smyth, lead a popular uprising in March 1939. He first overthrew King Winston XXI in the kingdom that employed him, the Winston Emperium, now forming part of the modern day Winston County, that then spread to the other 35 kingdoms. This resulted in most of the members of the Joint Monarchies being executed for treason and crimes against the state. Only a few surivived, there whereabouts unknown. However shortly after the uprising General Smyth instead of making good his promises of Democracy cracked down harder on the populace than what the Joint Monarchies had done. He banned all opposition to him on June 1940, declaring the establishment of the People\'s Free Democratic Republic of Nahris and performed a further rationalisation of the 36 kingdoms to 12 counties. In practice these 12 counties had next to no authority, with General Smyth having the final say in any law. Smyth ruled with an iron grip, enacting bizarre laws which would be repealled the same day, such as banning a type of alcohol that he was inebriated on out of offence only to repeal it and allow the consumption and manufacture of it the next day.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smyth\'s strange behaviour only worsened with age. He was a staunch Catholic and claimed a lot of his actions were dictated by God. Even those that were excessively cruel. This including the forced conversion of those of other faiths and none and the use of torture. His excommunication from the Catholic Church in April 1963 angered him to the point where in a strange and lavish ceremony held a month later he declared himself the true sucessor to the Papacy and founded a new branch of the Catholic Church in that year, even going as far as creating a new calendar system. Despite his absolute rule, he never gave himself an official political position until October 1969, where he declared himself &quot;President for Life&quot; in another lavish ceremony at the old Royal Central Palace in Nahris City, the capital. It would prove to be his undoing as the cost of the ceremony was too much for the hard done populace.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The now President Smyth ultimately would fall to the same sword he used to fell the Joint Monarchies. Factions of the now renamed People\'s National Army of Nahris, led by his former right hand man, General Jim Jones, started a violent uprising against Smyth. Though initially unsucessful and resulting in General Jones and his supporters going into hiding, the insurgency lasted long enough to take it\'s toll. Smyth ultimately losing support of key sections of the army and ended up being arrested on Sepetember 1974 in the Royal Central Palace. General Jones was declared Acting President and in one of his first acts of power, Jones had Smyth tried for 50 charges of treason, all of which he was found guilty. Smyth was then executed by hanging on May 1975. President Jones then put in all manner of checks and balances that prevented the military ever taking power and put all authority in the civilian Government. Thus founding the modern Republic of Nahris/Nahrin Union.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Currently the sole official language of the Nahrin Union is English although some minority languages may have a special recognised status for local use. Spelling tends towards British English with some American exceptions. Due to the problems caused by President Smyth\'s Catholic beliefs, Secularism is strictly enforced and any talk of religion is at best strongly discouraged and at worst resulting in admission to a special Secularism Rehabilitation class. This also results in the strict regulation of religious buildings and iconography. All churches, temples, mosques, synagogues and other religious buildings are of a standard nondescript design and are not allowed to have any reglious designs on them and are limited to showing one sign to show their use.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The current Governmental structure revolves around a Parliamentary Republic with some elements from a Semi-Presidential system. The sole legislative body is the 400 member National Assembly of Nahris, or Nahrin National Assembly. The Executive, the Government of Nahris, consists of 12 members of the National Assembly, 10 ordinary and the Prime Minister, usually the leader of the majority party or coalition, and his/her Depute. The President of the Nahrin Union, though theoretically the highest ranked politician, in practice is more of a figure head and although he/she has some reserve powers these are rarely used. The Judiciary is the Supreme Court of Nahris which decides the constituational nature of any laws passed.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Nahrin Union itself is divided into 12 counties, two of which have slightly more autonomy than the others. Each county is run by a County Council which enacts the policies decided by the National Assembly. The capital in Nahris City in Nahris County in the middle of the island. Most of the counties have one city designated as a local administrative centre, officially a County Seat. Tourism is not a priority for the Nahrin people, who live in effectively an economic autarky. Trade with other nations is minimal and almost all goods and services are produced domestically. As a result of the lack of tourist facilities and attractions, Nahris is known for being a very utilitarian state with few sites of interest. It also does not help that is isn\'t easy to get into the Nahrin Union in the first place. All foreigners undergo extensive background checks and any discrepency is enough to bar entry to the nation. Use of Government minders to tail foreigners of ethnic groups known to cause trouble in the Nahrin Union is not unknown. Leaving the nation as a citizen is more difficult due to schemes such as the infamous Restricted Travel List, which as the name suggests, restricts travel to the nation until it is removed from the list. Most common cause of an RTL sanction is being remotely near the site of a warzone or being diplomatically involved with combatents in a warzone.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Culturally the Nahrin Union is akin to a mix between France and Singapore, though damental right and private hospitals are rare and strictly regulated although higher quality healthcare is available at them where they exist. Education is also state funded and controlled and there is plenty of Social Security benefits. Minority as well as majority rights and civil rights in general are fiercely protected and anything seen as an infraction of those rights is vehemently challenged. Ironically it is impossible to go anywhere without running into one of the many omnipresent CCTV cameras in the nation. Birth control is encouraged as the population nears 70 million and the concern for the environmental damage and impact on resources is high on the Government agenda. This has gone as far as tax benefits to couples willingly taking abortions or keeping families very small. This attitude has been dubbed as &quot;Pro-Abortion&quot; as compared to Pro-Life and Pro-Choice by it\'s opponents.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The issues of environmental damage go as far as Nahrin transport policy. Getting a driving license and an automobile to use is best described as problematic. It is expensive and made as deliberately hard as possible. Even after obtained a license and a vehicle freedom of the road is not guaranteed as priority is always given to public transport and goods vehicles and even operators of those have issues with their own licensing regulations. All private cars have satellite tracked speed limiters that do not allow any vehicle, except for emergency service ones, to exceed the speed limit. Attempting to force the vehicle say by revving the engine repeatedly only results in an automatically triggered shutdown and an indication to the police. The police also have the ability to call for a vehicle to be remotely shut down on request, say if a car has been stolen and used in a crime. Ultimately people are encouraged to use the admittedly very efficient and clean public transport system covering an extensive mainline railroad network, extensive metro system and bus links to almost anywhere in the nation.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    There is no &quot;Second amendment&quot; and no recognition of the &quot;right to bear arms&quot;. Instead the overwhelming right to public safety overrides almost everything else and is enshrined as a fundamental civil right in the Nahrin constitution. Even if firearms would be needed as part of a job in other nations, the Nahrin Government will not issue any firearms licenses except in extremly exceptional circumstances such as law enforcement and military. Instead civilians make do with alternative tools and advice on situations that require use of a firearm such as pest control. This has resulted in innovative non-firearms pest control measures however.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Nahrin Unions economy mostly revolves around domestic consumption centering around agriculture and light industry. This has it\'s own problems with stagnation and inflation. The Government so far has no plans to introduce more exports to equalise the situation, instead relying on &quot;financial fiats&quot; to peg inflation and growth to artificially imposed levels. As things stand the general public is ambivalent to any foreign trade. It\'s foreign policy is also somewhat combative as any foreign nations attempts to suggest change are seen as unwelcome forms of interference and threats to it\'s national sovereignty. Whole diplomatic missions are known to be declared as &quot;Persona non Grata&quot; and expelled in days. Few ever get that status reversed, especially if their home nation has already poor relations with the Nahrin Union.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>\n      <font size="7">Humor</font>\n    </b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Chancellor Shaw</i>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <img border="0" title="[image] " alt="[image] " src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/qwertial_aphasia.png"></img>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>\n      <font size="7">Want an Embassy in TEP?</font>\n    </b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The East Pacific is looking to get more connected on an NS-worldly spectrum.

Well, actually they aren\xe2\x80\x99t aspiring to be elves. More like giants among elves, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t too hard to become. Still, we\xe2\x80\x99ve compiled a nice paper for all to read in their viewing pleasure. We hope it\xe2\x80\x99s a good show and that you\xe2\x80\x99ll get some enjoyment out of it!\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    So what have we been doing in The East Pacific these days? Well, if you must know\xe2\x80\xa6 because you were totally going to ask that question next\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re roleplaying, debating, and above all having fun. We\xe2\x80\x99re currently in the midst of some\n    <b>Winter Solstice Celebrations</b>\n    , made possible by the hard-working and fun-loving individuals in the region of the east. But what else? We\xe2\x80\x99re also roleplaying. Roleplaying, you might say? Whether or not you do roleplay on NS, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually pretty fun and exciting. Who else wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to see their characters turned to goo and drilled with four dozen bullet holes! Actually we\xe2\x80\x99re a little more benevolent than that. But only a little bit. Just a smidgen. And when we aren\xe2\x80\x99t roleplaying or just goofing around, we work on our government. Our\n    <b>Magisterium</b>\n    has picked up activity in the past few weeks or so, and the\n    <b>Conclave</b>\n    has just finished polishing off their standing orders. Of course our\n    <b>delegate</b>\n    remains ever vigilant and is only mildly oppressive! Nah, he\xe2\x80\x99s actually a good guy, except for how he roots for the Pittsburgh Steelers\xe2\x80\xa6 everyone knows the Cleveland Browns is the superior team\n    <img border="0" alt=";)" src="http://images.proboards.com/wink.gif"></img>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    But it\xe2\x80\x99s Xmas time in TEP. This year is a bit of a different feeling for some. I suppose it has to do with the mind control device recently installed within the bowls of the Pax Box, but apart from that and the occasional forced hailing of the Hive, there is still an inner thread that keeps us all together. And while a few of us may tug on that thread every once and a while, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break. We\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a bit more festive this year, as we tug on that string with candy canes instead of just fingers. The string may be a bit worn, but our resolve remains unbroken. Unbroken, I say! Let\xe2\x80\x99s just hope those candy canes don\xe2\x80\x99t have too much force behind them. Well, so be it. A Christmas that is full of strings and not some guy in a red suit with a beard who likes to give gifts to children. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like such a bad th-GLORY TO THE HIVE.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    What did I just say? Oh well.

All joking aside, this is one tough job. Thankfully we have what looks to be a great group of people who stepped up to answer the call.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    This past Magisterium election was full of vibrant discussion as to what each person wanted to help TEP with during their term. Of the eight who were nominated, seven were elected. Since then one of our Magisters has had to resign, leaving us with six strong minded, capable individuals who got right at the busy job they had ahead of them.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Magisterium is the legislature of The East Pacific. They are tasked with creating, proposing, debating on, and passing bills and laws to make our region run smoothly and fairly for everyone. It is because of these individuals that we have laws like our Secondary Endorsement Cap Act and our Adspum Rules. Speaking of which, one recent debate of interest was the consideration of the new Nationstates Century Theme, and what impact it would have on TEPs RMB Advertisement regulations. The Magisterium has also been going over Rights of Residents, and Ambassador masks for our Forums.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Although it may not always be the most glamorous job, we are indebted to the six Magisters currently serving our region. The position really is the crux of our government, and it takes a keen eye for not only looking at how to keep our region running, but also how to alter and improve laws in our ever changing world. So stop by, if you can, and say hi to the people who keep TEP going as one of the most vibrant, active communities in Nationstates.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    [align=center]\n    <font size="7">\n      <b>A Minute in Roleplay</b>\n    </font>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by yk001nul</i>\n    [/align]\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Courtesy of the Fyrdowsi Spy News Network\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Oh No, Not Again! Vekaiyu Split Apart in the War of Illusions</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy was peacefully sipping his coffee in the quiet township of Iruk when everything suddenly went up into flames, casting the city into chaos. It did not took very long for The Spy to discover that everywhere around Vekaiyu, skirmishes were blooming, fueled by an attempt on the life of the Premiere of Listonia. Very soon enough, The Spy watched as the simple political counter-attack turned into a war of philosophy against philosophy, of vulpine-kin against vulpine-kin .. of Maxists against non-Maxists.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    As was expected by The Spy, the war soon brought lots of interested (and deeply involved) parties. The Nation of Vulshain was one of the first to join the battle, partly because of blood bonds, and partly because of something else. Nothing couldn be more gruesome than the participation of the war legions of Allegheny, who mobilized their large army forces, laying waste to major cities such as Iruk and Nilisa.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Several other nations took note of the war, such as the concerned Nation of Bai Lung and Nation of Veerilion, but did not enter the prolonged skirmish for specific reasons. The Spy however knew that pockets of his fellow brothers and sisters in spirit were living in the cities, protected under the Secrecy Act of the Theocracy.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Thus, The Spy received special permission to peer through the eyes of an unordained brother who was in the midst of the battle, using the Divine Sight enchantment provided by a vulpine brother closest to the man in mission. Lo, how different things were under the illusion of destruction! Through the brother\'s eyes, he saw the bitter echo of what once was Maxism incarnate himself walking the very earth, silently possessing a hapless Alleghenian officer in search of the only thing binding himself to the mortal planes. He saw how the unordained brother managed to overcome his weakness and send all the imperiled brothers and sisters, as well as several uninitiated residents of the cities, to the land of Fyrdowsi near the end of the conflict.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    A visit by the Premiere herself to the devastated cities after the end of the major battles could not heal what has been done. Many major cities of Vekaiyu\'s provinces, such as Iruk, were reduced to rubbles, and links with the Nation of Listonia remained sensitive. Frankly, The Spy thought that all this would not happen if Vekaiyu embraced the Merciless Master instead, but he felt that nothing happened without His wisdom, and the proud Vekaiyu citizens might live through the conflicts as if nothing had ever happened.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Dizzying! Shades of Every Perceivable Spectrum Abound in the Different Colours!</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy recently received a report from one of the cleric group researching a way to enter someone else\'s dream via meticulous incantations and mental preparation. Honestly, The Spy thought that he had heard it before in a cinema advert section of a newspaper, but he paid no attention to the similarity as he peered through the group\'s metageological scan. He happened upon a scan made over the Nation of Reziel, where a figurative dream description of a young woman who was being called Mother by a man about her own age caught The Spy\'s eyes. He quickly cross-referenced the dream report to an official espionage report on the inner workings of the great nation of Reziel itself.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    It seemed that a silent crisis of rulership heritage was abound in the ancient nation, owing to its absolute fascination in the twins-bonded relationship of the kingdom and the Nation of Kangarawa. It seemed that someone in its government thought of its king as being incompetent enough to rein in his own twin brother, but The Spy thought that it was a norm among any nation with kingdoms at its helm. But The Spy found it most shocking to read that a shadowy element of the nation called the Brotherhood attempted to end the life of a simple woman over governmental problems. The trouble subsequently reached a climax in a flyer machine\'s accident involving a noblewoman of Reziel, which did not seem like an accident at all.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Wonder of wonders, The Spy found a twist in the seemingly simple end of the story. It seemed that the Kangarawans were quite clever in devising political assassinations; although there were no records suggesting direct involvement of the Kangarawa government in the accident, a portion of a military cable leaked from within the government\'s machinery seemed to suggest that they, at least, preferred the accident to happen.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Between the almost fanatical obsession of a noblewoman with her unborn child and the strained relationship of two ancient kingdoms, The Spy concluded that the nations would have a better future by having a Fyrdowsian \'middleman\' among its midst. The Spy sent the report along with a commendation for an \'embassy\' in the turbulent kingdoms to the Order\'s Operation Center for further actions.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Where\'s the Skeleton? Look Behind the Alabaster Walls!</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    It wasn\'t usual for The Spy to get to see an espionage report from across the Regional Border, but The Spy got that opportunity when a correspondent from the West Pacific handed him a copy of all infiltration activities going on beyond the Border. Fledgling it might be, but interesting nonetheless.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    A section of the report from the nation of Mahanoy piqued The Spy\'s interest. It seemed to start with the purported death of a man, and a miraculous rejuvenation of another. An article on the confirmed presence of a high-borne vulpine, possibly a Vekaiyu Premiere, right there in the West made The Spy wonder as to the extent of the vulpines\' influence. Further on, the report also made it known that a man described earlier in the report was in fact a marked man who lost his memory. The agent who made the report seemed particularly interested in the marked man\'s journey, going as far as describing his experience watching the marked man making an illegal landing of a flyer machine into the nation of Allegheny\'s airspace, slipping a note of commendation to the pilot of the aircraft in the report\'s footnote.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The report described various facts currently not known by any other spy agencies in the region, such as Allegheny\'s pseudo-religious culture in the midst of the back-stabbing world of the hard-nosed nation, the shadier elements of the East Pacific Treaty Organization, Reziel\'s level of readiness against the hordes of Packilvania and various other issues performed in secret by the great nations. Near the end of the Mahanoy report, The Spy was presented with vivid descriptions of a cosy relationship between an unknown Alleghenian military woman and the marked man, who was assumed to have assigned a new identity to himself. The Spy deemed the report worthy of national interest and submitted it to the Operation Center for further research.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>All Hail the King! Vulshain King Made Known in the Coronation of the New Monarch of Vulshain</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Spy has always thought of kings and kingdoms as a heretical remnant of the world\'s feudal past, as per the official dogma of the Theocracy, but it would not hurt to discover the camaraderie of a coronation in a kingdom somewhere. Thus, The Spy found himself amidst the dingy, smelly and sweaty masses of crowds greeting their new Leader in the nation of Vulshain. Ever the curious one, The Spy could not resist in getting to know more about the King. Posing as a lowly cameraman, The Spy masqueraded as a television crew en route to a special interview with the ruler, and from thereon, things get a wee bit more interesting.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    It was clear that despite an assassination attempt on the king, there was not even a little bit of worry on Vulshain\'s side. The King even had the leisure to casually enter the Southern Yugoslavian territory, with only a team of snipers to vouch for his safety. The Spy himself heard the leaders of the two country conversing about terrorists and terror in an almost make-belief casual calmness, which led The Spy to believe that they have something to hide.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Correction, it was actually someone to hide, after The Spy conducted a more thorough infiltration. The Spy had managed to crawl his way into a hospital where the terrorist, a certain unknown individual from the nation of Rygard, was said to be held without trial. From the way the military kept the terrorist at bay, The Spy was positive that something bad was bound to happen sooner or later. It was not long before a field agent near a Rygard embassy sent The Spy a pigeon message, stating that a group of guards opened fire on a group of people for no apparent reason. Seeing that embassies were often hosts to multinational guests, it was inevitable that the casualties involved victims from other nations, such as East Malaysia and Kelssek.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    After seeing all the conundrums and conspiracies of the royal elites, The Spy was convinced that the way of dynastic Kings and Kingdoms was doomed. Therefore, The Spy proposed to the Operation Center that all future operations within any foreign Kingdoms be held with ultimate caution.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    [align=center]\n    <font size="7">\n      <b>Country Profile</b>\n    </font>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Terasu</i>\n    [/align]\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Elafos Coalition was formed in the year 1066AD and is comprised of the city states, Aetria, Aquitania, Lycia, Nocteia, Tyr\'asu, Valeria and Vylade. Originally immigrants, the ethnic group which now resides widely across the North Western corner of The East Pacific began to arrive in late 900BC. Their origin is ultimately unknown, although academics have suggested several areas outside of The East Pacific, there is no concrete evidence to validate any such theories. Ancient texts generally refer to some unknown force, believed to be an opposing nation, which forced the Elafosians out of their home and across the sea. While the Elafos Coalition contains the largest concentration of people that actively identify themselves as &quot;Elafosian&quot;, such groups are spread throughout several islands within the Jeneras (all of which maintain close ties with the Coalition) and the neighbouring Iskios Federation. The Iskios Federation, long time rivals of the Coalition, is made up of the states Askia, Gallecia, Illyricium, Merhenia, Ormark and Skatos. Gallecia, Merhenia and Ormark predate the arrival of the &quot;Elafosians&quot;, once being formidable nations in their own right. After a prolonged war with the Coalition spanning over a century (1100-1300AD, roughly), they found themselves defeated but allied with three dissenting Elafosian states, Askia, Illyricium and Skatos. In modern terms, tensions between Elafos and Iskios led to a war, still ongoing, which saw Askia, Illyricium and Skatos rejoin the Coalition.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    While not considered a &quot;super power&quot; on a regional scale, the Coalition is by no means weak. Elafos usually prefers a &quot;hands off&quot; approach to regional politics, although it often sees itself as an enforcer of the North West, along with its close ally Warre.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    [align=center]\n    <font size="7">\n      <b>Interviews</b>\n    </font>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Vulshain</i>\n    [/align]\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>I interviewed two of our resident Roleplayers here.

Initially I thought it was a little weird, but I was not aware of how intricate and exciting the extent of roleplaying one\'s own characters and nations with other people, and playing out their plots and ideas in addition to my own. It\'s quite fun, really. I recommend it to anyone.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: You put a lot of time and effort into the histories and backgrounds of your nation and characters.  What was your reason of putting so much effort into designing your nation and characters?  Would you recommend this approach to roleplaying to others?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="green">Todd</font>\n    : I like history, personally. Applying history to my nations simply fulfills that like for me with respect to my nation. As far as backstories, they can be both beneficial and hindering. A little bit of backstory is okay, but too much or too heavy of a reliance on it can be stifling to other roleplayers. In the same breath, backstories can help other roleplayers get a glimpse of just what character or nation they are dealing with. So, I recommend a healthy balance, personally.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: How long have you been roleplaying?  You don\'t have to be specific. (Laughs)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="red">Todd</font>\n    : About 2-2.5 years now. Off and on in between.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: You were just elected as one of the new Magisters.  Congrats and welcome to the Magisterium.  Now, what other positions in TEP\'s government have you performed while a citizen of the East Pacific?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="green">Todd</font>\n    : Well, I was the delegate of the region for one year, starting in 2009. After that, I became an arbiter and served there for a while as a judge in the region. I now do regional map updates and help in the magisterium.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: What were some of your responsibilities as arbiter, so that those who are interested in becoming an arbiter will have a good idea on what they have to do?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="red">Todd</font>\n    : Essentially, I helped write the standing orders and ruled / debated on particular issues that were brought up in the conclave. Arbiters are selected, however. They should have a sense of what we do in The East Pacific in addition to having a level head. One of the things I tried to push when I was arbiter was to have people voice their opinions and not be afraid to go against the majority if they feel they need to. Great minds don\'t think alike. They think for themselves.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: A lot of your characters are either athletes or interested in sports.  Does this mean that you are into sports as well?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="green">Todd</font>\n    : I was at a time. I played lacrosse in grade school. But aside from that I just simply like to stay healthy and exercise. I can\'t sit in front of a computer all day. My brains turn to oatmeal. (Laughs) Of course, I\'m not a health nut. But I guess I\'d say I try to shake things up a bit.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: (Laughs) That is a good idea.  It\'s not healthy to be a couch potato.  Here\'s my next question: How did you get involved with TEP\'s newspaper?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="red">Todd</font>\n    : I don\'t really remember off hand. I think it was because when I changed the embassies on TEP\'s forums such that every region got their own sub-forum instead of just a thread. Doing that took a while, but the end product looked nice. I figured maybe it would be good to re-start our newspaper. We were all gung-ho for it, and the first issue was a success. I like newspapers that are big and have a wide variety of contributions from other players in the region. One person explaining what a region\'s doing just seems a bit one-dimensional.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: When you\'re not roleplaying or working, what do you do for fun in your spare time?  This also includes when you\xe2\x80\x99re not working on your Nationstates Wiki.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="green">Todd</font>\n    : Do you mean on NS or apart from NS?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: Apart from NS.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="red">Todd</font>\n    : I have a group of friends I typically spend time with. I also like to go places during the evening and socialize with people.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: Okay, let\'s go back to that same question, but this time, what do you do when you\'re on NS?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="green">Todd</font>\n    : Many things, (Laughs). Though nowadays I\'m mostly just in TEP having fun there.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: A few weeks ago, I was reading an article in a roleplaying magazine that talked about a rise in godmodders.  The article went to say that the vast majority of these godmodders aren\'t doing it intentionally, but are simply doing it by accident as they are newcomers to roleplaying.  My question is this: do you any tips, advice, warnings, and suggestions to newcomers to roleplaying on how they can avoid godmodding?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <font color="red">Todd</font>\n    : Just don\'t make your nation too awesome. Try and have a balance between flaws and strengths. Don\'t have &quot;end-all&quot; tech where no one can really stand up against you. Respect players with their RP histories, and don\'t be afraid to make your nation lose.

I wanted to see how others in the region would handle things, and I\'m sure I won\'t be disappointed. TEP is like that - if someone retires, someone else steps up to the plate and delivers. It\'s definitely an admirable quality any region can have, and one I am certainly proud of TEP for. Earlier this year, we endured the departure of nearly a dozen members due to various reasons. By the time April rolled around, it was difficult to fathom anyone would oblige and put together an issue. But, we worked on it, filled those vacancies, and we as a region are now back to being a well-oiled machine. This issue is entirely by\n    <b>Vulshain</b>\n    of TEP, a nation that has been with our region for over one year. Without further ado, here it is!\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Interview</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Vulshain / Smigol</i>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    We\'ll start off with an interview I did with everyone\'s favorite Pole, Smigol!\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: What got you interested in roleplaying?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: Actually, I got interested in roleplaying in TEP, was the same thing that brought me to NationStates. The possibiliy of having your own nation, and probability of a lot of international problems, even if not actually real. Outside of TEP I\'m not really a roleplayer.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: *Nods* I see. How long have you been roleplaying at TEP?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: I think I joined TEP around april last year? But, I had a moment of inactivity after the september due to some personal problems\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: Okay. So, what do you like about roleplaying at TEP, and what don\'t you like about roleplaying at TEP?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: What I like, is as I said a variety of international situations. Most of which are problems, which is even better. I was always interested in the culture of different real-life nations and people, so founding a place where I can have my on country, with my own culture, and roleplay it? It was brilliant. Though at first I had horrible problems with the lenght of the posts.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    I remember struggling to read a thread, because it was a lenght of a very short book. But now I got used to it, and I prefer the posts being that long.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Oh, also the large amount of inactive players is pretty weak.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: Yeah that is a problem at times. Being from an European nation, did you put parts of your culture into your nation\'s culture or did you just create your nation\'s culture from scratch?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smiggy says:\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Actually Smigsachenweiz is a germanic nation, so it was exciting for me to roleplay it, because I had to read a little about Germany culture, and I could completely cut off from Polish culture, for the sake of this nation. That said, most of the things my characters said in \'Smigsachwian\' language, were Polish proverbs translated into bastardized version of German.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: That\'s very interesting. Excellent work.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: Thanks.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: You\'re welcome.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    What do you do in your free-time, when you\'re not roleplaying?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: I mostly hang out with my friends after school - go to a pub for a beer, or somewhere. I also like to play some games, and meddle around in photoshop, making maps and stuff.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: Cool. I have seen some of your maps and art, and you\'re really good at them.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: Thanks, I try.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: No problem. Recently, you split your nation into several smaller nations. Was there a reason for you doing this?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: I thought I will have a bigger amount of free time, and I will be able to roleplay two additional nations - Dresana, which would be a Socialist state, and Chrzaska, based on second Polish republic (1918-1939), so a little authoritharian, and almost functional nation. Unfortunately the life wanted it different, so I never got around to do that.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    In future I will probably merge Chrzaska and Dresana, and offer it as a free plot on the map. This will require change of the names of some Serenitech\'s officials, true, but somethings is gotta be done about inactive nations\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: That\'s true.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Your original nation, Smigsachenweiz, had a history with Todd\'s Vekaiyu. Did you two work that out, or did you just come up with it on your own?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Basically, I\'m referring to Smigsachenweiz being a vassal to Vekaiyu, according to the NSWiki article on Smigsachenweiz.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: I came up with most of it, however everything was based on Vekaiyu\'s history. Plus I asked Todd a lot &quot;can I do this&quot; or &quot;can I do that&quot;. He\'s a really nice guy, and bascially just let me do anything if that didn\'t make him change his NSwiki page\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: That\'s true. Todd\'s a nice guy.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    So what was it like working with Todd?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: Sometimes I feel like if he knew everything about TEP and TEP history, so this is quite useful. Plus he writes really well (I mean, seriously, read &quot;The Others&quot;)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: I know. I enjoyed reading The Others. I\'ve actually talked to him about becoming a writer, but he\'s quite modest and humble. lol\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: It\'s true. Todd if you are reading this stop being such a nice guy, it makes the rest of us look bad.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: lol\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    One last question: do you have any ideas or suggestions to help deal with inactive players?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: You mean inactive, as not roleplaying, or not coming to the forum at all?\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: Not roleplaying.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: Hm, not sure, really. You can\'t really force someone into roleplaying. Though it\'s strange, being on a roleplay forum, and not roleplaying, I must say.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    However I\'d like to make a series of votings to remove nations of inactive players (I mean the ones, that stopped coming to the forum at all) from the map.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: That\'s true. Better to remove them than to have them take up space.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: Yeah, that\'s what I think\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Plus I think I will make a new version of the map (with layers, so if someone had to replace me, he would have an easier job)\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Me: That\'s a good idea. Thanks for letting me interview you.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Smigol: Thanks and you\'re welcome.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    And that\'s it for the interview.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Now for the nation profiles. Yep, there are two of them: Vekaiyu and Vulshain.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Vekaiyu:</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Todd McCloud</i>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Vekaiyu is a relatively large-sized nation in The East Pacific realm. Populated almost entirely by vulpines, the nation has undergone multiple transitions and occupations during its history, but today remains a formidable power. The nation formed when sentient vulpine tribes, who are believed to be evolved due to the torrential raining patterns that plagued the Vekaiyun area roughly one hundred million years ago, settled under a common king. The nation warred with itself relentlessly until it was occupied completely for roughly three hundred years, beginning during the close of the third century. It was during these tumultuous years the Vekaiyun people changed, adopting a new religion, new language, and new culture. In a few centuries after the occupation, Vekaiyu became a bastion for science and progress, and grew to become a powerful state. This power would wane when the nation changed once again in the sixteenth century, due in part to the Vekaiyun provinces warring with each other, paved by a weak king. Vekaiyu turned its attention elsewhere, flexing its colonial prowess and gaining various colonies in and around the NationStates\' world.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Today, the nation progresses through another transition - a freer market. While enterprise is still heavily regulated by the country, it has relaxed its hold on private licenses, which are required in order to own a business that operates in more than one province. Private ownership has skyrocketed and bolstered its economy, which is still reeling from a bloody civil war. This is due by and large by the new Vekaiyun Premier Ikrisia Levinile. While her youth and inexperience inhibits her, she continues to move The Nation of Green to new heights. The Kivreskov, or the Vekaiyun legislature, commenced operations in February. The nation is more responsive to the cultures and traditions of other nations. English is now mandated and is required to be taught in primary schools. The nation hungrily eyes the breadbasket Listonia, it\'s neighbor to the east.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    The Vekaiyun spirit is one of closeness each other and a strong will to not bend to the wills and desires of others. While Vekaiyu may be relaxing it\'s stubbornness against other nations and cultures, the spirit of the people continue to endure within the nation.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Vulshain:</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Vulshain</i>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Vulshain is a large nation located in the East Pacific region on the northern continent, where the sea borders the southern, southwestern, and southeastern coasts. The nation began when the local native Lobos united with the Vulpines who arrived via a land bridge in prehistoric times from Vekaiyu thousands of years ago. Vulshainians have a strong sense of pride in their heritage and culture, but they are open-minded and are quite comfortable mixing old ways with new ways.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    Vulshain is mainly inhabited by Vulpines and Lobos, although humans and a few other races live here as well. For most of its history, Vulshain has been a monarchy, although in the mid and late 20th century, the country became a democratic republic that quickly transformed into a fascist military dictatorship ironfistedly ruled by Merrill Rivers, acrazed megalomaniac. With the aid and support of its neighbors and other foreign powers, the monarchy was restored. However, from 2003 to 2006, a terrible civil war erupted killing countless lives and damaging the nation even more. The nation has recovered, but the scars from both the Civil War and the reign of Merrill Rivers are still there. With the recent election and crowning of the new Monarch of Vulshain, King Samuil Rainard, the nation\'s people now hope for a better and brighter future.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    While the physical damage from Rivers\' reign has healed, the reversing of the damage to the nation\'s culture is slow, but steady. Merrill Rivers attempted to purge Vulshain of its traditions and customs in order to create a new culture, one where he and his government would guide and influence. After Rivers\' downfall, Vulshain has painstakingly tried to recover its past. Today, the nation is now on the road of getting back its lost heritage.\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <b>Hilarities</b>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <i>by Vulshain</i>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    <br clear="none"></br>\n    And speaking of traditions, here we have a tradition of putting funny pictures up.
