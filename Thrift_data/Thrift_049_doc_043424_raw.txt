How could Darth Vader be a Transformer?

up vote 13 down vote favorite 1

While following my kids in the toys aisle of a big department store, I spotted a strange
crossover : Star Wars and Transformers :



Image: http://i.stack.imgur.com/9BiLr.jpg

How could it possibly happen? The Transformers's home world wasn't supposed to be in our
galaxy, or at least contemporary, and Star Wars " A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.... "?

Is there any explanation on how the 2 universes could merge or it is just a thoughtless
commercial combination? star-wars transformers share | improve this question edited Dec 30

Taking the second question first:

Is there any explanation on how the 2 universes could merge or it is just a thoughtless
commercial combination?

For the most part, yes, in 2008 Hasbro launched the Transformers Crossovers line ; this was
purely for commercial gain, and it was never done with any intent of defining canon.

Now taking the first question:

How could it possibly happen?

Parallel/alternate universes and bridges between them are always a good explanation for
these types of things.

    Depending on which representation of the Transformers you are referring to (there are a
    number of different representations of the Transformers in media ), there is support for
    the idea that alternate universes do exist in many versions of the Transformers
    universes:

    - In Generation One (the first appearance of the Transformers in comic form in the US),
    Spider-Man appears in issue three, implying that the Transformers exist in Earth-616 1 ,
    which is one in many alternate realities (which are able to be bridged, as the Exiles did
    regularly , as it was their mission to protect the Multiverse) within the Marvel
    Multiverse .

    

    - In October of 2007, Marvel and IDW published a New Avengers/Transformers crossover
    which did not take place outside of Earth-616 (again, existing in the Marvel
    Mutliverse).

    

    - "Infestation" was a mega-crossover event among all of IDW's major titles, including
    the Transformers series . The core of the event hinged on bridges between alternate
    universes.

    

    - "Chaos" was released in 2011, and in it, Galvatron believes he is on a righteous path to
    save Cybertron from an attack launched from the "Dead Universe"defined as :

    



a mysterious and malevolent realm that exists beyond the plane of "normal" space.

That said, it's safe to say that alternate universes do exist in the realm of the Transformers
universe(s), and it's only through that could that universe and the Star Wars universe
collide.

Now whether or not that actually did happen or supports this toy's existence is a separate
question.

Basically, it could and it's not outside the realm of possibility but not currently supported
in canon from either fictional universe.





1 It is debated whether or not the Marvel comics version of the Transformers existed in
Earth-616 . However, the opponents of that idea counter that the Transformers actually
existed in Earth-120185 , which still supports the idea that the Transformers exist within
the Marvel Multiverse and subject to exposure from alternate realities. share | improve this

413 1 11 I thought parallel universes definitely did exist in the Transformer world. E.g.
After G1 was tied in with Beast Wars (so one universe), there was Armada and then the new movies.
I thought that the universe toy line was based on this concept, with Unicron pulling
characters from different universes. –  Wikis Dec 30 '11 at 13:35 There was, in the Marvel
comics, an excellent crossover series between the Transformers and GIJoe, which I have
around the house somewhere. But you're right, there are at least half a dozen different
Transformers universes defined by marketing, if not more. With Transformers, it's entirely
about marketing, not canon. –  BBlake Dec 30 '11 at 14:15 @BBlake The four issue limited
series had Spider-Man in it, so it stands to reason that the Transformers (at least in the
Marvel comics adaptation) exist on Earth-616. Additionally, the Marvel cross-over still
dealt with that reality, so if it is Earth-616 (where alternate realities are rampant), then
it stands to reason it's more prevalent than I implied. I've updated the answer, as this fact
doesn't change the core fact that it would be an alternate universe. –  casperOne Dec 30 '11
at 20:17 @Wikis I'm not sure where G1 was tied with Beast Wars (I didn't follow), but based on
BBlake comment, the G1 comic series is set in Earth-616, so it's more prevalent. I've updated
the answer to reflect that without taking away the gist that it would be an alternate universe.

Well, since the Transformers exist contemporaneously with our world, and the "Star Wars"
movies exist in our world, perhaps some Transformers happen to be fans and decided to cosplay.
