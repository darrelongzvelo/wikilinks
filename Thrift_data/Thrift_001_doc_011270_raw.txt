These suits are out of this world: an exploration of the spacesuit



The clothes we wear have both form and function. Real spacesuits are no different.Â  Like a
second skin they must provide a protective barrier for the astronaut.Â  At the same time
they are a product of the 20th century.Â  A century replete in media opportunities and
national symbolism.

What we imagine





Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzm1abJCvf1qk5528.jpg

The right stuff.Â  Where the astronauts and public see that it all began.Â  The
experimental record breaking pilots and planes of the post Korean War US X-series.Â  This
1960 image is of the most famous of all astronauts, Neil Armstrong first human on the Moon.
Here, as an X-15 pilot, Neil is wearing a Navy Mark IV high altitude/vacuum suit.

Public and pilots are one thing.Â  Scientists, well they may see the race with a different
beginning.Â  The first ‘nauts’ were frankly a bunch of animals.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzm1sqIkCP1qk5528.jpg

As such they did not go in for suits.Â  Not much in the way of protection at all.Â  Laika , the
first cosmodog (or dogonaut?), the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2 that was
launched into outer space on November 3, 1957.Â  The first Earth animal to reach space.Â 
She had a flight harness, oxygen and water supply for her scheduled six day flight.Â  Laika
did not survive her journey, dying hours after launch from overheating.

Ham, the astro-chimp, fared somewhat better, making a live return to Earth.Â  Ham’s
capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean and was recovered by a rescue ship later that day .
Â  Â  He only suffered a bruised nose.Â  Â  Perhaps it was the NASA helmet?Â  A
prudent use of tax-payer money.Â  Congress of today may have approved.

Ham had his vital signs and tasks monitored using computers on.Â  Â  Â  The capsule
suffered a partial loss of pressure during the flight, but Ham’s biopack couch space suit
prevented him from suffering any harm .Â  Ham’s lever-pushing performance in space was
only a fraction of a second slower than on Earth, demonstrating that tasks could be performed
in space .Â 

The for space ‘firsts’



The first suit into space was worn by the Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin . Gagarin wore this
SK-1 suit in his history making flight on board Vostok 1 on April 12 1961.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmbsrTidp1qk5528.jpg

The pressurised rather baggy, looking suit weighs 20kg and is modeled on the Russian flight
suits of the time.Â  The primary life support is provided by the capsule.Â  The suit is
designed for low pressure/vacuum intra-vehicular activity and ejection.Â  Not
surprising given that Gagarin parachutes from 7000m on re-entry.Â  The sphere shaped
command capsule separately parachutes, empty, to Earth.

Similarly the US suits of the NASA Mercury program were modified Navy Mark IV flight suit.Â 
They provided pressure support to ensure adequate blood circulation whilst in flight.Â 
Oxygen and radio contact were the other necessities for these very sedentary flights.

When NASA began the Mercury Project in 1958, one of the first needs was a pressure suit to
protect the astronaut in the event of a sudden depressurization of the cabin in the vacuum of
space.

The Mark IV suit had solved the mobility problems with the use of elastic cord which arrested
the “ballooning” of the suit, and at 10kg, was the lightest pressure suit developed for
military use.

    The Mercury suit incorporated several changes from the Navy Mark IV:

    - Replacement of the “open loop” breathing system with a “closed loop” system,
    eliminating the rubber diaphragm around the wearer’s face. Oxygen entered the suit
    through a hose connected at the wearer’s waist, circulated through the suit to provide
    cooling, and exited through a hose on the right side of the helmet, or through the face
    opening depending on whether the faceplate was closed or open. A small pressure bottle
    connected by a small hose to a connector next to the astronaut’s left jaw was used to
    pressurize a pneumatic seal when the faceplate was closed.

    

    - Replacement of the dark gray nylon outer shell with one made of aluminum-coated nylon,
    for thermal control purposes

    

    - Replacement of the black leather safety boots with ones made first from white coated
    leather, later aluminumized nylon-coated leather, again for thermal control.

    

    - Introduction of straps and zippers to provide a snug fit, along with refinements in the
    shoulder, elbow, and knee retaining cords

    

    - Special gloves with four curved fingers for grasping the controls, with the middle
    finger made straight for pushing buttons and flipping toggle switches.

    

    - A “biomed” flap on the right thigh for the connection of biomedical connections to
    the spacecraft’s telemetry systems.

    



Each astronaut had three pressure suits: one for training, one for flight, and one for a
backup. All three suits cost $20,000 USD total and unlike the military Mark IV suits, had to be
individually tailored to each astronaut.

On May 5, 1961, Shepard piloted the Freedom 7 mission and became the second person, and the
first American, to travel into space.Â  He was launched by a Redstone rocket , and unlike
Gagarin’s 108-minute orbital flight, Shepard stayed on a ballistic trajectoryâ€”a
15-minute suborbital flight which carried him to an altitude of 187Â km. Unlike Gagarin,
whose flight was strictly automatic, Shepard had some control of Freedom 7 , spacecraft
attitude in particular. The launch was seen live on television by millions.

It might be supposed that the inclusion of women in the USSR cosmonaut program may have bought
in changes.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmep4x3941qk5528.jpg

Alas no.Â  The SK-2 was the SK-1, ehhh, for women.Â  Valentina Tereshkova , the
“Cinderella of the Stars”, became the first woman cosmonaut on June 16 1963 on board
Vostok 6 .Â 

Although Tereshkova experienced nausea and physical discomfort for much of the flight she
orbited the earth 48 times and spent almost three days in space. With a single flight, she
logged more flight time than the combined times of all American astronauts who had flown
before that date.

Vostok 6 was the final Vostok flight and was launched two days after Vostok 5 which carried
Valery Bykovsky into a similar orbit for five days, landing three hours after Tereshkova. The
two vessels approached each other within 5 kilometres at one point, and Tereshkova
communicated with Bykovsky and with Khrushchev by radio.

NASA did not allow women astronauts until the 1970’s.Â  This is despite women pilots
meeting the pre-flight criteria.Â  Jerry Cobb was in the top 95% of pilots who tried out for
the Mercury program.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmiqatLpv1qk5528.jpg

The short expansion from the single-person Vostok and Mercury programs to the multi-person
Voskhod and Gemini programs heralded many spacesuit changes and diversification.

The Gemini program was created for the purpose of teaching astronauts the techniques
involved in docking, rendezvous, long-term flight and space-walks.

The first space-walk was nearly fatal.Â  On March 18 1965 Alexei Leonov emerged from his
Voshkod spacecraft.Â  His Berkut suit ballooned such that he had extreme difficulty
re-entering hatch of his spacecraft.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzme5pPwXH1qk5528.jpg

The suit is a modified SK-1.Â  Life support was contained in back pack, had a large enough
oxygen supply to last 45 minutes of activity. Movement within the suit was seriously
restricted.Â  It was only used by the crew of the Voskhod 2.

Three months later on June 3 1965, Edward H White II had no such problems for his spacewalk in
his G4C suit.Â  His space walk from Gemini 4 was played out in the full glare of world-wide
audience and captured in glorious colour.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmeasDdGO1qk5528.jpg

There were three main suit variants developed for the Gemini program.Â  : G3C designed
for intra-vehicle use; G4C specially designed for extra-vehicular activity and
intra-vehicle use; and a special G5C suit worn by the Gemini 7 crew for 14 days inside the
spacecraft

Walking on the Moon

The Apollo program to the Moon bought to the fore the extra functionality required for walking
on the surface of another world.Â  The suits needed to be self supporting, more robust in
case of falls, flexible so that activities could be carried out and shield the astronauts from
the radiation expected on the airless surface of the Moon.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmf0nNRbt1qk5528.jpg

    Additional requirements for extra-vehicular activity include:

    - Shielding against ultraviolet radiation

    

    - Limited shielding against particle radiation

    

    - Means to maneuver, dock, release, and/or tether onto a spacecraft

    

    - Protection against small micrometeoroids , some traveling at up to 27,000 kilometres
    per hour, provided by a puncture-resistant Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment , which is
    the outermost layer of the suit. Experience has shown the greatest chance of exposure
    occurs near the gravitational field of a moon or planet, so these were first employed on
    the Apollo lunar EVA suits.

    



Apollo (Block I A1C suit (1966-1967) was a derivative of the Gemini suit, worn by primary and
backup crews in training for two early Apollo missions. The nylon pressure garment melted and
burned through in the Apollo 1 cabin fire. This suit became obsolete when manned Block I Apollo
flights were discontinued after the fire.

The Block II Apollo suit (Apollo/Skylab A7L) was the primary pressure suit worn for 11 
Project Apollo flights, 3  Skylab flights, and the US astronauts on the Apollo-Soyuz Test
Project between 1968 and 1975. The pressure garment’s nylon outer layer was replaced with
fireproof Beta cloth after the Apollo 1 fire. This suit was the first to employ a liquid-cooled
inner garment and outer micrometeroid garment.

The Soyuz program was first designed to match the US Apollo effort and place men on the
Moon.Â  These saw a continual design to meet extra vehicular activities.

From Soyuz 1 to Soyuz 11 no pressure suits were worn between launch and re-entry.Â 

The Yastreb suit was designed to overcome the difficulties experienced by the berkut suit of
Leonov.Â  The Yastreb design was much more rigid using a system of pulleys and lines to
regulate movement. The backpack containing life support was mounted in a metal box that could
be attached to the chest or to the leg to ease access through the small Soyuz hatch.

The suit was to be worn only in the Orbital module of the Soyuz spacecraft and needed two people
to put it on.

The Yastreb suit was only used once, this was during the Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 docking and crew
exchange. The suit was not worn during launch or reentry. During the mission both cosmonauts
experienced problems with the suit.

The Sokol , shown above, was introduced in 1973 and is still in use in 2012.Â  It is designed as
a rescue suit, in case of spaceship depressurisation.Â 

Orlan suits are used for extra-vehicular activity.Â  Originally developed for the Soviet
lunar program as a lunar orbit extra-vehicular activity suit. It is Russia’s current
extra-vehicular activity suit. Used from 1977 to present.

International cooperation



Space suit design has since gone ahead in a series of improvements as the suits have been used
for use inside the MIR, Soylut, Skylab and International Space Station.Â  This now
included the inclusion of women in the Shuttle program.Â  Including the first American
woman to walk in space, Kathryn Sullivan.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmitcea3T1qk5528.jpg

She is pictured wearing an Extravehicular Mobility Unit used on both the Space Shuttle and
International Space Station . The extra-vehicular mobility unit is an independent
anthropomorphic system that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support,
and communications for a Shuttle or ISS crew member to perform extra-vehicular activity in
earth orbit . Used from 1982 to present.

The shuttle program saw a big shift initially.Â  From STS-5 (1982) to STS-25 (1986) no
pressure suits were worn during launch and re-entry. The crew would wear only a blue- flight
suit with an oxygen helmet.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmu0neo4C1qk5528.jpg

After the Challenger disaster a Launch Entry Suit was used on STS-26 . This partial pressure
suit was used from 1988 to 1998.Â  It is modeled below, by the first Indian woman in space
Kalpana Chawla .Â  She sadly was one of seven crew members killed in the Space Shuttle
Columbia disaster .



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmir4U6QY1qk5528.jpg

Advanced Crew Escape Suit were used on the Space Shuttle starting in 1994.Â  The Advanced
Crew Escape Suit or ACES suit, is a full pressure suit currently worn by all Space Shuttle crews
for the ascent and entry portions of flight. The suit is a direct descendant of the U.S. Air
Force high-altitude pressure suits worn by SR-71 Blackbird and U-2 spy plane pilots, X-15 and
Gemini pilot-astronauts and the Launch-Entry Suits worn by NASA previously worn by
astronauts.

Included in design is the need for mobility inside the space stations for a much larger variety
of activities.Â  Such as this 1996 image of Shannon Lucid exercising on the ISS on a
treadmill.



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmvo22ray1qk5528.jpg

An Orlan space suit is a series of semi-rigid one-piece space suit models.Â  They have been
used for spacewalks in the Russian space program , the successor to the Soviet space program ,
and by space programs of other countries, including NASA .



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmvwnb1vK1qk5528.jpg



Image: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzmvrdxIT21qk5528.jpg

A variant of the Orlan Spacesuit, with improvements, is used by the Chinese Space Program .

Fiction, the future and experimental suits



As you can see I have come a long way.Â  From the early suits to the sophisticated suite of
suits in the current programs.Â  I can hardly wait for hard shell suits, voyages to Mars, the
Constellation program and space suits in fiction - an exciting story continues………
