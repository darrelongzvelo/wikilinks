Homebuilder Confidence Doubles In 12 Months Payam Bakhaje ( Licensed in DC, MD and VA ) (Long &
Foster Realtors )



   Homebuilder confidence is soaring.                      

Image: /image_store/uploads/5/0/2/4/9/ar134289063294205.png

For the second time in three months, the National Association of Homebuilders reports that
the Housing Market Index made sizable gains. 

The Housing Market Index measures homebuilder confidence in the new construction market and
is scored between 1-100. Readings above 50 indicate favorable conditions in the
single-family new home market. Readings below 50 indicate poor conditions.

The Housing Market Index leaped to 35 in July, a 6-point improvement and the indexâ€™s
biggest one-month gain since September 2002.

The HMI is now up 14 points this year and is more than double its value of one year ago.

    The Housing Market Index itself is a composite of three separate survey questions sent to
    NAHB members monthly. The questions are basic :

    1 - How are market conditions for the sale of new homes today?

    

    2 - How are market conditions for the sale of new homes in 6 months?

    

    3 - How is prospective buyer foot traffic?

    



For July 2012, home builders reported huge gains . Current home sales are up 6 points; sales
expectations for the next six months are up 11 points; and buyer foot traffic is up 6 points.

All three survey answers made 5-year highs. Not since 2007 has sales volume and foot traffic
been as strong, and over the next 6 months, builders expect a blow-out finish to the year.

Itâ€™s no surprise, either.

Low mortgage rates have lowered monthly housing payments to levels below monthly rent for a
comparable home. Plus, programs such as the FHA 3.5% downpayment program continue to help
first-time buyers get in homes.

There is a downside to rising homebuilder confidence, however. When builders feel more
comfortable about their business and the prospects for the future, theyâ€™re less
likely to make sales concessions to to offer free upgrades. If youâ€™re shopping for
new construction, therefore, consider moving up your time frame.

Home affordability remains historically high today. It may not be so tomorrow.

Simple Real Estate Definitions : Right To Cancel Payam Bakhaje ( Licensed in DC, MD and VA )
(Long & Foster Realtors )



Image: /image_store/uploads/4/6/2/6/2/ar134115694826264.jpg

 

As part of the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, refinancing homeowners are granted a 3-day
â€œcooling offâ€� period post-closing during which they retain the right to
rescind, or â€œcancelâ€�, their recent refinance without penalty or cost.

The Right To Cancel is protection against surprises at closing and/or a change of heart.
Itâ€™s also a safety valve for homeowners signing paperwork under duress. With 3 days to
revisit and rethink the terms of a loan, a homeowner can maintain tighter control of his/her
financial situation.

If you ever have the wish (or need) to execute your right to rescind, be aware that the process is
a formal one. The required steps must be completed on-time, and in order, or else your request
will be invalid.

    The process starts with a document labeled â€œRight To Cancelâ€�.
    Itâ€™s included in your closing package and lists the terms of a rescission in
    straight-forward language. Among the key points :

    1 - You have 3 business days during which to cancel your loan

    

    2 - When you cancel the refinance, the entire transaction is cancelled

    

    3 - You must submit your Right To Cancel in writing

    



â€œBusiness dayâ€� is defined by the government to be every day, save for Sundays
and federal holidays. A loan that closes on a Monday, therefore, must be rescinded prior to
Friday at 12:00 AM.

Typically, rescission requests are faxed to the settlement agent, notary, or title company
assigned with the refinance. Itâ€™s good practice to ask for an acknowledgement of
receipt as proof of delivery, too.

There are some refinances for which the Right to Cancel does not apply, however. This includes
refinances linked to an investment property, and loans not collateralized by residential
real estate. There are other conditions, too, that may supersede your right to rescind so be
sure to ask your lender.

New Home Sales Rise For 7th Month Out Of 8 Payam Bakhaje ( Licensed in DC, MD and VA ) (Long & Foster
Realtors )

The April New Home Sales report suggests that the market for newly-built homes is as strong as
the market for existing ones. 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of new homes sold rose 3.3 percent in April  to
a seasonally-adjusted, annualized 343,000 units sold â€” its second-highest
reading since April 2010.

Image: /image_store/uploads/5/3/9/1/2/ar133795914921935.png

April 2010 marked the last month of that yearâ€™s federal home buyer tax credit program.

Aprilâ€™s New Home Sales data also marks the 7th of eight consecutive months during
which the number of new homes sold climbed nationwide, a streak unequaled in recent
history. During this period, the supply of new homes for sale has dropped 13%. 

The complete new home inventory is down to 146,000 homes nationwide.

At the current pace of sales, home buyers across the county would exhaust the complete supply
of newly-built homes in 5.1 months.

This, too, is a significant figure.

When home supplies fall below 6 months of inventory, itâ€™s widely believed to indicate
a â€œsellerâ€™s marketâ€� and there hasnâ€™t been more than 6 months of
a new home supply since October 2011. This has placed upward pressure on new home prices and
helps to explain why the average home sale price is up 9% from just 6 months ago.

Homes are selling, and theyâ€™re rising in price â€” a trend that todayâ€™s
buyers should expect to continue through the summer and fall months.

Record-low mortgage rates have moved home affordability to an all-time high with home
builders now reporting the highest levels of buyer foot traffic at any time since 2007 . As
builder confidence grows, buyers can expect to find fewer â€œgreat dealsâ€�
â€” especially as demand for homes outpaces supply. 

If youâ€™re a home buyer in search of new construction, therefore, the best new
construction â€œdealsâ€� of 2012 may be the ones you find today. By 2013, the deals
may be gone

30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Rates Fall To 3.78% Nationwide Payam Bakhaje ( Licensed in DC, MD
and VA ) (Long & Foster Realtors )

For the fifth consecutive week, conforming 30-year fixed rate mortgage rates have dropped to
new all-time lows.

According to this weekâ€™s Primary Mortgage Market Survey from Freddie Mac,
â€œprimeâ€� mortgage applicants willing to pay 0.8 discount points plus closing
costs can secure a mortgage rate of 3.78% , on average.

This is a small improvement in rate over last week when the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage
rate was 3.79% with 0.7 discount points.

1 discount point is equal to 1 percent of your loan size.

Like everything in real estate, though, mortgage rates are local. Freddie Mac reports that
the mortgage rates available to consumers  varied by region .

    Image: /image_store/uploads/1/3/1/8/9/ar133795884098131.jpg

    - Northeast Region : 3.78% with 0.7 discount points 

    

    - West Region : 3.74% with 0.9 discount points

    

    - Southeast Region : 3.79% with 0.7 discount points

    

    - North Central Region : 3.83% with 0.6 discount points

    

    - Southwest Region : 3.81% with 0.7 discount points

    



North Central Region residents currently pay the lowest fees and get the highest rates. For
residents of the West, itâ€™s the opposite. Everywhere, however,mortgage rates are
down. As compared to one year ago, todayâ€™s monthly carrying cost for a conforming,
30-year fixed rate mortgage is lower by $50 per $100,000 mortgaged, or $600 per year.

A $300,000 mortgage would save $1,800 annually.

Mortgage rates have been dropping because Wall Street remains concerned for the futures of
Greece, Spain, Italy and the European Union. Several European nations are at-risk for a
sovereign debt default and Greece remains a threat to leave the EU. To protect against
potential loss, investors have been moving money away from risky holdings toward safer ones
â€” a class that includes U.S. mortgage-backed bonds.

As demand for the bonds rise, prices do, too. This leads mortgage rates lower and so long as
economic uncertainty remains, mortgage rates are expected to stay low.

Low mortgage rates make this a good time to buy or refinance a home. Talk to your loan officer to
review your mortgage options.

Home Affordability Reaches New High In Q1 2012 Payam Bakhaje ( Licensed in DC, MD and VA ) (Long &
Foster Realtors )

Falling mortgage rates and stagnant home prices are making a positive effect on home
affordability nationwide. Never before in recorded history have so many homes been
affordable to households earning a moderate annual income.

Last week, the National Association of Home Builders reported the Home Opportunity Index
 at 77.5 â€” its highest reading of all-time. The index indicates that more than 3 of
every 4 homes sold last quarter were affordable to households earning the national median
income of $65,000.

Last quarter marks the 12th straight quarter â€” dating back to 2009 â€” in which
the index surpassed 70. Prior to this run, the index had never crossed 70 even once.

That said, like most real estate statistics, the Home Affordability Index has a national
purview. National data is of little value to homeowners in specific cities , or in specific
neighborhoods.

Last quarter, home affordability varied by region.

In the Midwest, for example, affordability was highest. 7 of the top 10 most affordable
markets nationwide were spread throughout Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Indiana. The top two
spots, however, went to an East Region town (Cumberland) and a Pacific Northwest Region city
(Fairbanks, Alaska), respectively.

The top 5 most affordable cities for home buyers in Q1 2012 were:    

    Image: /image_store/uploads/8/1/7/9/7/ar133773704979718.png

    1 - Cumberland, MD (99.0%)

    

    2 - Fairbanks, AK (98.9%)

    

    3 - Wheeling, WV (97.0%)

    

    4 - Kokomo, IN (95.8%)

    

    5 - Indianapolis, IN (95.8%)

    



At #17, the Lakeland/Winter Haven, Florida area was the top-ranked South Region city last
quarter.

By contrast, the Northeast Region and Southern California ranked among the least affordable
housing markets â€” again. Led by the New York-White Plains, NY-Wayne, NJ area, 8 of the
10 least affordable areas were in the Mid-Atlantic and California, and for the 16th
consecutive quarter the New York metro area was ranked â€œLeast Affordableâ€�.

Just 31.5 percent of homes were affordable to households earning the area median income
there, up from 25.2 percent six months ago.

The rankings for all 225 metro areas are available for download on the NAHB website.

Washington DC Shaw Payam Bakhaje ( Licensed in DC, MD and VA ) (Long & Foster Realtors )

Shaw grew out of freed slave encampments in the rural outskirts of Washington City.
Originally called "Uptown", in an era when the city's boundary ended at "Boundary Street"
(now Florida Avenue), in the Urban Renewal Era the neighborhood began to be referred to as Shaw
because of the neighborhood Junior High School named after Civil War Colonel Robert Gould
Shaw , the commander of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry .

The neighborhood thrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the pre- Harlem center of
African American intellectual and cultural life. Howard Theological Seminary received its
first matriculates in 1866; by 1925, Professor Alain LeRoy Locke was advancing the idea of "
The New Negro ", and Langston Hughes was descending from LeDroit Park to hear the "sad songs" of
7th Street . The most famous Shaw native to emerge from this periodâ€”sometimes called
the Harlem Renaissance â€”was Duke Ellington .

 

Following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 4, 1968, riots erupted in many
D.C. neighborhoods, including Shaw, Columbia Heights , and the H Street , NE corridor. The
1968 Washington, D.C. riots marked the beginning of a decline in population and development
that would condemn much of the inner city to a generation of economic decay.

Shaw is a mostly residential neighborhood of 19th century Victorian row houses. The
architecture of these houses, Shaw's central location, and the stability of D.C.'s housing
market have transformed the neighborhood through gentrification . [ 1 ] Shaw's notable place
in African American history has made the recent influx of affluent professionals
particularly controversial.

Infrastructure and landmarks



Shaw is served by the Mt. Vernon Square Metro , Shaw/Howard Univ and U St/African-Amer Civil
War Memorial/Cardozo Green Line Metro stations.

Among Shaw's many landmarks are Ben's Chili Bowl , the Lincoln Theatre , Shiloh Baptist
Church, the Twelfth Street YMCA Building , and the north portion of the Walter E. Washington
Convention Center .

Shaw is a neighborhood located in the Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. It is roughly
bounded by M Street, NW or Massachusetts Avenue NW to the south; New Jersey Avenue, NW to the
east; Florida Avenue , NW to the north; and 11th Street, NW to the west. The area also includes
the U Street Corridor , which is the commercial hub of the Shaw area, extending westward to 16th
Street NW .

Florida Avenue marks the northern boundary with the adjacent neighborhoods of Columbia
Heights and LeDroit Park . The area consists of gridded streets lined with small Victorian
rowhouses. It is dominated by Howard University and the shops and theatres along U Street,
14th Street in the Logan Circle area, and centered along 7th Street NW, the original
commercial hub of the area prior to redevelopment in the wake of the 1968 riots and Green Line
Metrorail construction.

Shaw is sometimes considered to include Logan Circle , Truxton Circle , and other
neighborhoods east of 16th Street and north of Downtown Washington, D.C. , but in recent years
those neighborhoods have become seen as separate entities.
