Serbia ( pronounced  /ˈsɜrbiə/   (

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg/13px-Speaker_Icon.svg.png
listen ) ), officially the Republic of Serbia ( Serbian : Република Србија,
Republika Srbija , pronounced  [republika sr̩bija] ), is a landlocked country located at
the crossroads of Central - and Southeastern Europe , covering the southern part of
Carpathian basin and the central part of the Balkans . Serbia borders Hungary to the north;
Romania and Bulgaria to the east; the Republic of Macedonia to the south; and Croatia , Bosnia
and Herzegovina , and Montenegro to the west; additionally, it borders Albania through
Kosovo , whose status is disputed . Belgrade , Serbia's capital city is among the most populous
in Southeastern Europe .

After the settlement in the Balkans , Serbs have formed a medieval kingdom . The kingdom had
evolved into a Serbian Empire before reached its peak in the 14th century. By the 16th century,
Serbian lands were conquered and occupied by the Ottomans , at times interrupted by the
Habsburgs . In the early 19th century, the Serbian revolution has established the country as
the region's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory and
pioneered the abolition of feudalism and serfdom in Southeastern Europe. [7] [8] The former
Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina , has joined Serbia in 1918. Decimated as a result of World War
I , the country had united with other South Slavic peoples into a Yugoslav state which existed
in several forms until 2006, when Serbia once again became fully independent.

In February 2008, the parliament of Kosovo , Serbia's southern province with an ethnic
Albanian majority, had declared independence. The response from the international
community has been mixed. Since 1918, Serbia has regarded Kosovo as its autonomous province;
currently governed by UNMIK , a UN mission established in 1999.

Serbia is a member of the United Nations , Council of Europe , BSEC , and currently presides over
CEFTA .

The Serbian economic system is classified by the World Bank as upper-middle income. In
addition, Serbia has been categorized as an emerging country by the International Monetary
Fund because of its rapid economic growth and industrialization after the independence in
2006. [9] WTO accession is expected in 2010. [10] Serbia has a high Human Development Index
[11] and Freedom House in 2008 listed Serbia as one of the few free Balkan states. [12] The
country is also an EU membership applicant and a neutral country. [13] [14]

4500-4000 BC - Vinča culture

The Neolithic Starčevo and Vinča cultures existed in or near Belgrade and dominated the
Balkans (as well as parts of Central Europe and Asia Minor ) about 8,500 years ago. [15] [16]
Some scholars believe that the prehistoric Vinča signs represent one of the earliest known
forms of writing systems (dating to 6,000 - 4,000BC). [17]

The Paleo-Balkan peoples, such as the Thracians , Dacians , Illyrians were autochthonous
inhabitants of Serbia prior to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC. Greeks expanded into
the south of modern Serbia in the 4th century B.C., the northernmost point of the empire of
Alexander the Great being the town of Kale-Krševica . The Celtic tribe of Scordisci settled
in the 3rd century BC and built many fortifications such as the Kalemegdan fortress, and
founded many modern cities in Serbia, such as Singidunum , now known as Belgrade .

Belgrade is believed to have been torn by 140 wars since Roman times . [18] [19]

, ten Roman emperors were born in Sirmium , one of the 4 capitals of the late Roman Empire

The Romans conquered parts of Serbia in 2nd century BC, in 167 BC when conquering the West,
establishing the province of Illyricum and the rest of Central Serbia in 75 BC, establishing
the province of Moesia . Srem was conquered in 9 BC and Bačka and Banat in 106 AD after the Dacian
wars.

Contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several Roman provinces such as Moesia ,
Pannonia , Praevalitana , Dalmatia , Dacia and Macedonia . The northern Serbian city of
Sirmium was one of the capitals of the Roman Empire during the Tetrarchy . [20] 17 Roman
Emperors were born in present-day Serbia, second only to what is present-day Italy. [21]

The most famous Roman Emperor born in Serbia is Constantine I who empowered Christianity
throughout the Roman Empire The northern Serbian city of Sirmium ( Sremska Mitrovica ) was
among the top 4 cities of the late Roman Empire , serving as its capital during the Tetrarchy .
[22] Contemporary Serbia comprises the classical regions of Moesia , Pannonia , parts of
Dalmatia , Dacia and Macedonia . Around the 6th century, Slavs appeared on the Byzantine
borders in great numbers. [23] The chief towns of Serbian Upper Moesia in the Principate were:
Singidunum ( Belgrade ), Viminacium (sometimes called municipium Aelium; modern Kostolac
), Remesiana ( Bela Palanka )

Serbian Empire , 1355 AD.

The beginning of the Serbian state starts with the settling of the White Serbs in the Balkans
led by the Unknown Archont , who was asked to defend the Byzantine frontiers from invading
Avars . Emperor Heraclius granted the Serbs a permanent dominion in the Sclavinias of Western
Balkans upon completing this task. By the 750s a great-grandson of the Unknown Archont -
Prince Višeslav [25] [26] managed to unite several territories, which led to the founding of
Raška , which lay between the crisis-struck Byzantine and the growing Frankish Empire . [27]
[28]

At first heavily dependent on the Byzantine Empire as its vassal , Raška gained independence
by the expulsion of the Byzantine troops and the major defeat of the Bulgarians around 850 AD
during the rule of Vlastimir of Serbia , the founder of the first Serbian dynasty, the House of
Vlastimirović . The Christianization of the Serbs was complete in 867–869 when Byzantine
Emperor Basil I sent priests after Knez Mutimir had acknowledged Byzantine suzerainty. [29]
At about the same time, the western Serbs were subjugated to the Frankish Empire . [30] The
First dynasty died out in 960 A.D; the wars of succession for the Serb throne led to Serbian
incorporation into the Byzantine Empire in 971. Around 1040 AD, an uprising in the medieval
state of Duklja overthrew Byzantine rule. Duklja then assumed dominion over Serb lands
during the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1077 A.D., Duklja became the first Serb Kingdom [31]
following the establishment of the Catholic Bishopric of Bar . From the late 12th century
onwards, Raška rose to become the dominant Serbian state. Over the 13th and 14th centuries,
it ruled over the other Serb lands. During this time, Serbia began to expand eastward and
southward into Kosovo and northern Macedonia and northward for the first time.

The Serbian Empire was proclaimed in 1346 by Stefan Dušan , during which time the country
reached its territorial, spiritual and cultural peak, becoming one of the most powerful
states in Europe. Dušan's Code , a universal system of laws, was enacted. Dušan was
succeeded by his son Stefan Uroš V . Rather young and too incompetent to maintain a strong grip
on the empire created by his father, he watched the Serbian Empire fragment into a
conglomeration of principalities. Uroš died childless in December 1371, after much of the
Serbian nobility had been destroyed by the Turks in the Battle of Maritsa earlier that year.

The Houses of Mrnjavčević , Lazarević and Branković ruled the Serbian lands in the 15th
and 16th centuries. Constant struggles took place between various Serbian kingdoms and the
Ottoman Empire . After the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 and the Siege of Belgrade
, the Serbian Despotate fell in 1459 following the siege of the provisional capital of
Smederevo . After repelling Ottoman attacks for over 70 years, Belgrade finally fell in 1521.
Forceful conversion to Islam became imminent, especially in the southwest Raška , Kosovo
and Bosnia . To the south, the Republic of Venice expanded, gradually taking over the coastal
areas.

Image: http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png Siege of
Belgrade (1456) , unknown author, 19th century

After the loss of independence to the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire , Serbia
briefly regained sovereignty under Jovan Nenad in the 16th century. Three Austrian
invasions and numerous rebellions, such as the Banat Uprising , constantly challenged
Ottoman rule. Vojvodina endured a century long Ottoman occupation before being ceded to the
Habsburg Empire in the 17th–18th centuries under the Treaty of Karlowitz . As the Great Serb
Migrations depopulated most of Kosovo and Central Serbia , the Serbs sought refuge across the
Danube river in Vojvodina to the north and Military Frontier in the West where they were
granted rights by the Austrian crown under measures such as the Statuta Wallachorum of 1630.
The Ottoman persecutions of Christians culminated in the abolition and plunder of the
Patriarchate of Peć in 1766. [32] As Ottoman rule in the Pashaluk of Belgrade grew ever more
brutal, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I formally granted the Serbs the right to their
autonomous crown land following several petitions. [33]

Serbian revolution



The quest for national emancipation was first undertaken during the Serbian national
revolution , in 1804 until 1815. The liberation war was followed by a period of formalization,
negotiations and finally, the Constitutionalization, effectively ending the process in
1835. [34] For the first time in Ottoman history the entire Serbian Christian population had
risen up against the Sultan . [35] The entrenchment of French troops in the western Balkans,
the incessant political crises in the Ottoman Empire, the growing intensity of the Austro –
Russian rivalry in the Balkans, the intermittent warfare which consumed the energies of
French and Russian Empires and the outbreak of protracted hostilities between the Porte and
Russia are but a few of the major international developments which directly or indirectly
influenced the course of the Serbian revolt . [35]

Karađorđe Petrović , the hero of Serbian revolution (1804-1815)

During the First Serbian Uprising , or the first phase of the revolt, led by Karađorđe
Petrović , Serbia was independent for almost a decade before the Ottoman army was able to
reoccupy the country. Shortly after this, the Second Serbian Uprising began. Led by Miloš
Obrenović , it ended in 1815 with a compromise between the Serbian revolutionary army and the
Ottoman authorities. German historian Leopold von Ranke published his book "The Serbian
revolution" in 1829. [36] They were the easternmost bourgeois revolutions in the
19th-century world. [37] Likewise, Serbia was second in Europe, after France, to abolish
feudalism . [38]

The Convention of Ackerman in 1826, the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829 and finally, the Hatt-i
Sharif , recognized the suzerainty of Serbia with Miloš Obrenović I as its hereditary
Prince . [39] [40] The struggle for liberty, a more modern society and a nation-state in Serbia
won a victory under first constitution in the Balkans on 15 February 1835. It was replaced by a
more conservative Constitution in 1838. In the two following decades, temporarily ruled by
the Karadjordjevic dynasty , the Principality of Serbia actively supported the neighboring
Habsburg Serbs , especially during the 1848 revolutions . Interior minister Ilija
Garašanin published The Draft (for South Slavic unification), which became the standpoint
of Serbian foreign policy from the mid-19th century onwards. The government thus developed
close ties with the Illyrian movement in Croatia-Slavonia region that was a part of the
Austria-Hungary.

Following the clashes between the Ottoman army and civilians in Belgrade in 1862, and under
pressure from the Great Powers , by 1867 the last Turkish soldiers left the Principality . By
enacting a new constitution without consulting the Porte, Serbian diplomats confirmed the
de facto independence of the country. In 1876, Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire,
proclaiming its unification with Bosnia . The formal independence of the country was
internationally recognized at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, which formally ended the
Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 ; this treaty, however, prohibited Serbia from uniting with
Bosnia and Raška region by placing them under Austro-Hungarian occupation . [41]

From 1815 to 1903, Principality of Serbia was ruled by the House of Obrenović , except from
1842 to 1858, when it was led by Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević . In 1882, Serbia, ruled by
King Milan , was raised to Kingdom . In 1903, following May Overthrow , the House of
Karađorđević , descendants of the revolutionary leader Đorđe Petrović assumed
power. Serbia was the only country in the region that was allowed by the Great Powers to be ruled
by its own domestic dynasty. During the Balkan Wars lasting from 1912 to 1913, the Kingdom of
Serbia tripled its territory by reacquiring part of Macedonia, [42] Kosovo, and parts of
Serbia proper. As for Vojvodina, during the 1848 revolution in Austria , Serbs of Vojvodina
established an autonomous region known as Serbian Vojvodina . As of 1849, the region was
transformed into a new Austrian crown land known as the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of
Temeschwar . Although abolished in 1860, Habsburg emperors claimed the title of Grosswojwod
, until the end of the monarchy and the creation of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in
1918.

Balkan wars and World War I

article: Serbian Campaign (World War I)

Balkan Wars refers to the two wars that took place in South-eastern Europe in 1912 and 1913. The
First Balkan War broke out when the member states of the Balkan League attacked and divided
Ottoman territories in the Balkans in a seven-month campaign, resulting in the Treaty of
London . For the Kingdom of Serbia , this victory enabled territorial expansion into Raška
and Kosovo. The Second Balkan War soon ensued when Bulgaria, dissatisfied with its gains,
turned against its former allies, Serbia and Greece. Their armies repulsed the Bulgarian
offensive and counter-attacked, penetrating into Bulgaria, while Romania and the Ottomans
used the favourable time to intervene against Bulgaria to win territorial gains. In the
resulting Treaty of Bucharest , Bulgaria lost most of the territories gained in the First
Balkan War , and Kingdom of Serbia annexed Vardar Macedonia . The Kingdom of Serbia enlarged
its territory by 80% and its population by 50% within just two years; it also suffered high
casualties on the eve of World War I, with around 20,000 dead in the Balkan campaigns. [43]

On 28 June 1914 the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria at Sarajevo in
Bosnia-Herzegovina by Gavrilo Princip , a Yugoslav nationalist member of Young Bosnia , and
an Austrian citizen , led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Kingdom of Serbia . [44] In
defense of its ally Serbia, Russia started to mobilize its troops, which resulted in
Austria-Hungary's ally Germany declaring war on Russia. The retaliation by
Austria-Hungary against Serbia activated a series of military alliances that set off a chain
reaction of war declarations across the continent, leading to the outbreak of World War I
within a month. [45]

The Serbian Army won several major victories against Austria-Hungary at the beginning of
World War I, such as the Battle of Cer and Battle of Kolubara – marking the first Allied
victories against the Central Powers in World War I. [46] Despite initial success, it was
eventually overpowered by the joint forces of the German Empire , Austria-Hungary and
Bulgaria in 1915. Most of its army and some people went into exile to Greece and Corfu , where
they recovered, regrouped and returned to the Macedonian front during the World War I to lead a
final breakthrough through enemy lines on 15 September 1918, freeing Serbia again and
defeating Austro-Hungarian Empire and Bulgaria. [47] Serbia, with its campaign , was a major
Balkan Entente Power [48] which contributed significantly to the Allied victory in the
Balkans in November 1918, especially by enforcing Bulgaria's capitulation with the aid of
France. [49] The country was militarily classified as a minor Entente power . [50] Serbia was
also among the main contributors to the capitulation of Austria-Hungary in Central Europe.

Serbia's casualties accounted for 8% of the total Entente military deaths; 58% of the regular
Serbian army (420,000 strong) perished during the conflict. [51] The total number of
casualties is placed around 1,000,000, [52] more than 25% of Serbia's prewar size, and a
majority (57%) of its overall male population. [53] [54] [55]

under a German Military administration , under a joint German-Serb government with Milan
Nedić as Head of the "Government of National Salvation". Serbia was the scene of a civil war
between Royalist Chetniks commanded by Draža Mihailović and Communist Partisans
commanded by Josip Broz Tito . Against these forces were arrayed Nedić's units of the Serbian
Volunteer Corps and the Serbian State Guard .

After one year of occupation, around 16,000 Serbian Jews were murdered in Axis-occupied
Serbia, or around 90% of its pre-war Jewish population. Banjica concentration camp was
established by the German Military Administration in Serbia . [56] Primary victims were
Serbian Jews, Roma, and Serb political prisoners. [57] Other camps in Serbia included the
Crveni Krst concentration camp in Niš and the Dulag 183 in Šabac . Staro Sajmište was one of
the first concentration camps for Jews in Europe. Staro Sajmište was the largest
concentration camp in Axis-occupied Serbia. [58]

Relations between Serbs and Croats in Yugoslavia severely deteriorated during World War II
as a result of the creation of the Axis puppet state of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH)
that comprised most of present-day Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina , and parts of
present-day Serbia's Autonomous Province of Vojvodina . The NDH committed large scale
persecution and genocide of Serbs, Jews , and Roma . [59] The number of Serbs and others killed
varies from more than 300,000 to more than 700,000. The estimate of the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum indicates that between 330,000 and 390,000 ethnic Serb residents
of Croatia, Bosnia and parts of Serbia (primarily the Syrmia region) were murdered during the
Ustaše genocide campaign ; [60] same figures are supported by the Jewish Virtual Library.
[61] Yad Vashem reports that more than 500,000 Serbs were killed overall, whereas official
Yugoslav sources used to estimate more than 700,000 victims, mostly Serbs. The Jasenovac
memorial so far lists 75,159 names killed at the this concentration camp alone, [62] out of
around 100,000 estimated victims. [63] In April 2003 Croatian president Stjepan Mesić
apologized on behalf of Croatia to the victims of Jasenovac. [64] In 2006, on the same
occasion, he added that to every visitor to Jasenovac it must be clear that Holocaust,
genocide and war crimes took place there. [65]

Out of roughly 1,000,000 casualties in all of Yugoslavia up until 1944, [66] [67] around
250,000 were Serbs of different ethnicities, according to Zundhauzen. [68] The overall
number of ethnic Serb casualties in Yugoslavia was around 530,000, out of whom up to 400,000 in
the NDH genocide campaign . [69] By late 1944, the joint Soviet and Bulgarian invasion swung in
favour of the partisans in the civil war; communists were subsequently established as the
ruling elite, whereas the Karadjordjevic dynasty was banned from returning to Serbia. [70]
The Syrmia front was the last sequence of the internal war in Serbia following the Soviet-led
Belgrade Offensive . Around 70,000 people in Serbia alone perished during the Communist
takeover, [71] (including 10,000 Belgraders ) [72] whereas Ministry of Justice figures puts
lower estimate around 80,000, of whom 60,000 were of Serbian origin. [73] [74]

Socialist Yugoslavia

See also: Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  and Socialist Republic of Serbia

The communist takeover resulted in abolition of the Kingdom , ban on the royal family's return
and a subsequent orchestrated constitutional referendum on the republic-socialist type of
government. [75] In the aftermath of the victory of the communist Yugoslav Partisans , a
totalitarian single-party state was soon established in Yugoslavia by the League of
Communists of Yugoslavia . All opposition was repressed and people deemed to be promoting
opposition to the government or promoting separatism were given harsh prison sentences or
executed for sedition. Serbia became a constituent republic within the Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia known as the Socialist Republic of Serbia and had a republic-branch of
the federal Communist party, the League of Communists of Serbia . The republic consisted of
Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo , Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina , and
Central Serbia .

One of Serbia's most powerful and influential politicians in this period was Aleksandar
Ranković , a high-ranking official in the federal Communist party who was considered one of
the "big four" Yugoslav Communists, alongside Josip Broz Tito, Edvard Kardelj , and Milovan
Đilas and who was popular in Serbia. [76] Ranković served as head of the UDBA internal
security organization and served as vice-president of Yugoslavia from 1963 to 1966. [76] In
1950, Ranković as minister of interior reported that since 1945 the Yugoslav communist
regime had arrested five million people. [77] For years Ranković served as Tito's
right-hand man and supported Tito's decision to break Yugoslavia away from domination by
Soviet Union by having the UDBA obstruct the USSR's efforts to infiltrate state
infrastructure and the Yugoslav Communist party. [78] These actions resulted in the
USSR-led Cominform accusing the Yugoslav government of being dominated by a
"Tito-Ranković clique" that they accused of being a fascist regime. [79] He supported a
centralized Yugoslavia and opposed efforts that promoted decentralization that he deemed
to be against the interests of Serb unity. [76] Ranković sought to secure the position of the
Serbs in Kosovo and gave them dominance in Kosovo's nomenklatura . [76] Ranković's power and
agenda waned in the 1960s with the rise to power of reformers who sought decentralization and
to preserve the right of national self-determination of the peoples of Yugoslavia. [80] In
response to his opposition to decentralization, the Yugoslav government removed Ranković
from office in 1966 on various claims, including that he was spying on Tito. [80] Ranković's
dismissal was highly unpopular amongst Serbs. [80]

After the ouster of Ranković, the agenda of pro-decentralization reformers in Yugoslavia,
especially from Slovenia and Croatia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial
decentralization of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and
recognizing a Muslim Yugoslav nationality. [80] As a result of these reforms, there was a
massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being
Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs in large scale. [80]
Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest,
including the creation of the University of Pristina as an Albanian language institution.
[80] These changes created widespread fear amongst Serbs that they were being made
second-class citizens in Yugoslavia by these changes. [81] These changes was harshly
criticized by Serbian communist official Dobrica Ćosić , who at the time claimed that they
were contrary to Yugoslavia's commitment to Marxism through conceding to nationalism,
especially Albanian nationalism . [82]

Dissolution of Yugoslavia

Main article: Breakup of Yugoslavia

Slobodan Milošević rose to power in Serbia in 1989 in the League of Communists of Serbia
through a series of coups against incumbent governing members. Milošević promised
reduction of powers for the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. This ignited
tensions with the communist leadership of the other republics that eventually resulted in
the secession of Slovenia , Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia from Yugoslavia.
[83]

Multiparty democracy was introduced in Serbia in 1990, officially dismantling the former
one-party communist system. Critics of the Milošević government claimed that the Serbian
government continued to be authoritarian despite constitutional changes as Milošević
maintained strong personal influence over Serbia's state media. [84] [85] Milošević
issued media blackouts of independent media stations' coverage of protests against his
government and restricted freedom of speech through reforms to the Serbian Penal Code which
issued criminal sentences on anyone who "ridiculed" the government and its leaders,
resulting in many people being arrested who opposed Milošević and his government. [86]

The period of political turmoil and conflict marked a rise in ethnic tensions and between
Serbs and other ethnicities of the former Communist Yugoslavia as territorial claims of the
different ethnic factions often crossed into each others' claimed territories. Serbs
feared that the nationalist and separatist government of Croatia was led by Ustase
sympathizers. They also accused the separatist government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of
being led by Islamic fundamentalists . The governments of Croatia and Bosnia in turn accused
the Serbian government of attempting to create a Greater Serbia . These views led to a
heightening of xenophobia between the peoples during the wars. [ citation needed ]

In 1992, the governments of Serbia and Montenegro agreed to the creation of a new Yugoslav
federation called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which abandoned the predecessor
SFRY's official endorsement of communism, and instead endorsed democracy. In response to
accusations that the Yugoslav government was financially and militarily supporting the
Serb military forces in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Croatia, sanctions were imposed by the
United Nations , during the 1990s, which led to political isolation, economic decline and
hardship, and serious hyperinflation of currency in Yugoslavia. [ citation needed ]

Milošević represented the Bosnian Serbs at the Dayton peace agreement in 1995, signing the
agreement which ended the Bosnian War that internally partitioned Bosnia & Herzegovina
largely along ethnic lines into a Serb republic and a Bosniak-Croat federation . When the
ruling Socialist Party of Serbia refused to accept municipal election results in 1997, which
resulted in its defeat in the municipalities, Serbians engaged in large protests against the
Serbian government and government forces held back the protesters. Between 1998-99, peace
was broken when the worsened situation in Kosovo with continued clashes in Kosovo between the
Yugoslav security forces and Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The confrontations led to a
multi-nation conflict called the Kosovo War . [ citation needed ]

Đinđić , reformist Prime Minister of Serbia from 2001 to 2003

In September 2000, opposition parties claimed that Milošević committed fraud in routine
federal elections. Street protests and rallies throughout Serbia eventually forced
Milošević to concede and hand over power to the recently formed Democratic Opposition of
Serbia (DOS). The DOS was a broad coalition of anti-Milošević parties. On 5 October, the
fall of Milošević ended Serbia's international isolation during the Milošević years.
Milošević was sent to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on
accusations of sponsoring war crimes and crimes against humanity during the wars in
Yugoslavia, which he was held on trial to until his death in 2006. With the fall of Milošević,
Serbia's new leaders announced that Serbia would seek to join the European Union . In October
2005, the EU opened negotiations with Serbia for the Stabilization and Association
Agreement , a preliminary step towards joining the EU .

Serbia's political climate since the fall of Milošević remained tense. In 2003, the prime
minister Zoran Đinđić was assassinated as result of a plot originating from circles of
organized crime and former security officials. Nationalist and EU-oriented political
forces in Serbia have remained sharply divided on the political course of Serbia in regards to
its relations with the European Union and the West. However, the tensions between those
political poles gradually eased since, as the issues of Kosovo independence, economical
crisis and aspiration towards accession to the European Union forced the sides to find more
common ground.

From 2003 to 2006, Serbia was part of the "State Union of Serbia and Montenegro." This union was
the successor to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 21 May 2006, Montenegro held a
referendum to determine whether or not to end its union with Serbia. The next day,
state-certified results showed 55.4% of voters in favor of independence. This was just above
the 55% required by the referendum.

On 5 June 2006, following the referendum in Montenegro, the National Assembly of Serbia
declared the "Republic of Serbia" to be the legal successor to the "State Union of Serbia and
Montenegro." [87] Serbia and Montenegro became separate nations. In April 2008 Serbia was
invited to join the intensified dialogue programme with NATO despite the diplomatic rift
with the Alliance over Kosovo. [88]

Serbia officially applied for EU membership on 22 December 2009. [89] The government of
Serbia has the goal for the EU accession in 2014 per the Papandreou plan - Agenda 2014 . [90] [91]
European Commission 's Vice President Jacques Barrot seems to back this initiative,
predicting Serbia's EU accession within 5 to 7 years following its formal application. [92]

Located at the crossroads between Central and Southern Europe Serbia is found in the Balkan
peninsula and the Pannonian Plain . The Danube passes through Serbia with 21% of its overall
length, joined by its biggest tributaries, the Sava and Tisza rivers. [93] The province of
Vojvodina covers the northern third of the country, and is entirely located within the
Central European Pannonian Plain. Dinaric Alps , gradually rising towards south, cover most
of western and central Serbia. The easternmost tip of Serbia extends into the Wallachian
Plain . The eastern border of the country intersects with the Carpathian Mountain range , [94]
which run through the whole of Central Europe.

The Southern Carpathians meet the Balkan Mountains , following the course of the Great Morava
, a 500 km long river. The Midžor peak is the highest point in eastern Serbia at 2156 m. In
the southeast, the Balkan Mountains meet the Rhodope Mountains . The Šar Mountains of Kosovo
form the border with Albania, with one of the highest peaks in the region, Djeravica , reaching
2656 meters at its peak. Dinaric Alps of Serbia follow the flow of the Drina river , overlooking
the Dinaric peaks on the opposite shore in Bosnia and Herzegovina .

National parks



Over 31% of Serbia is covered by forest. [95] National parks take up 10% of the country's
territory. [96] Serbia has 5 national parks , 23 nature parks and 22 nature reserves . Name

Serbia's climate varies between a continental climate in the north, with cold winters, and
hot, humid summers with well distributed rainfall patterns, and a more Adriatic climate in
the south with hot, dry summers and autumns and relatively cold winters with heavy inland
snowfall. Differences in elevation, proximity to the Adriatic Sea and large river basins, as
well as exposure to the winds account for climate differences. [97] Vojvodina possesses
typical continental climate, with air masses from northern and western Europe which shape
its climatic profile. South and South-west Serbia is subject to Mediterranean influences.
However, the Dinaric Alps and other mountain ranges contribute to the cooling down of most of
the warm air masses. Winters are quite harsh in Raška because of the mountains which encircle
the plateau. [98]

Mediterranean micro-regions exist throughout southern Serbia, [99] in Zlatibor and the
Pčinja District around valley and river Pčinja . The average annual air temperature for the
period 1961–90 for the area with an altitude of up to 300 m (984 ft) is 10.9  °C (51.6  °F
). The areas with an altitude of 300 to 500 m (984 to 1,640 ft) have an average annual temperature
of around 10.0 °C (50.0 °F), and over 1,000 m (3,281  ft ) of altitude around 6.0 °C
(42.8 °F). [100] The lowest recorded temperature in Serbia was −39.5 °C
(−39.1 °F) on January 13, 1985, Karajukića Bunari in Pešter , and the highest was
44.9 °C or 112.8 °F, on July 24, 2007, recorded in Smederevska Palanka . [101]

Environment



Serbia's environment is monitored by the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning and
protected through the Serbian Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA). The NATO bombings of
1999 caused lasting damage to the environment of Serbia, with several thousand tons of toxic
chemicals stored in targeted factories being released into the soil, atmosphere and water
basins affecting humans and the local wildlife. [102] Recycling is still a fledgeling
activity in Serbia, with only 15% of its waste being turned back for re-use, steps are being
taken on improving the situation. [103]

The Serbian Energy Efficiency Agency (SEEA), was founded in May 2002. A national non-profit
organization, it develops and proposes programmes and measures, co-ordinates and
stimulates activities intended to achieve rational use and saving of energy, as well as the
increase in efficiency of energy use in all sectors of consumption. [104] The country is
looking towards making wider use of renewable energy, a 20 megawatt wind farm is being
developed in Belo Blato as part of a 300 megawatt development plan. [105]

rivers drain to the Black Sea , by way of the Danube river. One notable exception is the Pčinja
which flows into the Aegean . The largest natural lake is Belo Jezero , located in Vojvodina,
covering 25 square kilometers. The largest artificial reservoir, Đerdap, locally known as
Đerdapsko Lake, covers an area of 163 square kilometers on the Serbian side, and it has a total
area of 253 square kilometers. The largest waterfall, Jelovarnik , located in Kopaonik, is 71

As Serbia regained its independence in 2006, after 88 years in various federations , the
parliament announced a constitutional referendum that would replace the former
Yugoslav-era constitution and created the new framework for the newly created nation by
ratifying a new Constitution of Serbia . Serving his second term as President , Boris Tadić is
the leader of the center-left Democratic Party . His second reelection was won with a narrow
50.5% majority in the second round of the presidential election held on 4 February 2008.

Parliamentary elections were held in May 2008. The coalition " For a European Serbia " led by
Boris Tadic, claimed victory, but was significantly short of an absolute majority.
Following the negotiations with the leftist coalition centered around the Socialist Party
and parties of national minorities, those of Hungarians, Bosniaks and Albanians, an
agreement was reached to make-up a new government, headed by Mirko Cvetković . Present-day
Serbian politics are fractiously divided on different issues, such as Serbia's role in the
European Union and the scale of government intervention in the economy.

Kosovo has been governed since 1999 by UNMIK , a UN mission. The current Special
Representative , Lamberto Zannier , oversees the governance of Kosovo. The Provisional
Institutions of Self-Government , has an assembly and a president , currently Fatmir Sejdiu .
Although the assembly has declared independence from Serbia, the legality of this move is
unclear and is currently being debated in the International Court of Law.

Administrative divisions

Main article: Administrative divisions of Serbia

The territorial organization of Serbia is regulated by the Law on Territorial Organization,
[106] adopted in the National Assembly of Serbia on 29 December 2007. [107] Under the Law, the
units of the territorial organization are: municipalities , cities and autonomous
provinces. [106]

Serbia is divided into 150 municipalities and 24 cities, which are the basic units of local
self-government. [106] The city may or may not be divided into "city municipalities". Five
cities, Belgrade , Novi Sad , Niš , Kragujevac and Požarevac comprise several
municipalities, divided into "urban" (in the city proper) and "other" (suburban). There are
31 city municipalities (17 in Belgrade, 5 in Niš, 5 in Kragujevac, 2 in Novi Sad and 2 in
Požarevac ). Of the 150 municipalities, 83 are located in Central Serbia , 39 in Vojvodina and
28 in Kosovo. Of the 24 cities, 17 are in Central Serbia, 6 are in Vojvodina and 1 in Kosovo. [106]

Serbia has two autonomous provinces: Vojvodina in the north (which includes 39
municipalities and 6 cities) and Kosovo and Metohija [106] in the south (with 28
municipalities and 1 city). The Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija has been
transferred to the UN administration of UNMIK since June 1999. In February 2008, the
Government of Kosovo declared its independence , a move recognized by a minority of countries
(most of the European Union and USA) but not recognized by Serbia or the United nations .
Autonomous province has its own assembly and executive council (government). It enjoys
autonomy on the certain meters like education and culture. The area that lies between
Vojvodina and Kosovo is called Central Serbia . Central Serbia is not an administrative
division (unlike the autonomous provinces), and it has no regional government of its own.

Municipalities and cities are gathered into districts , which are regional centers of state
authority, but have no assemblies of their own; they present purely administrative
divisions, and host various state institutions such as funds, office branches and courts.
Districts are not defined by the Law on Territorial Organisation, but are organised under the
Government's Enactment of 29 January 1992. [108] Serbia is divided into 29 districts (17 in
Central Serbia, 7 in Vojvodina and 5 in Kosovo), while the city of Belgrade presents a district
of its own.

Defense

See also: Serbian Armed Forces  and Military history of Serbia

Serbia is a constitutionally declared neutral country, as such it is not a member of a military
alliance, nor does it participate in foreign combat operations. It does however participate
in peacekeeping operations under United Nations authority. [13]

Conscription is still mandatory with regular service lasting 6 months, but a high number of
recruits take the opportunity to put forth conscientious objection and serve 9 months in
civil service. [109] Professionalization of the military is expected to be completed by the
end of 2010. [110]

demographic census

As of January 2010, Serbia (without Kosovo) has an estimated number of 7,306,677 citizens
(not including over 200,000 internally displaced persons from Kosovo, who will be counted as
a permanent population in next census, taking place in 2011). [111] The 2002 census was not
conducted in Kosovo, which was under United Nations administration at the time. According to
CIA estimates, Kosovo has around 1,8 million inhabitants, majority of them Albanian with
Kosovo Serbs coming in second. [112]

Serbs , are the largest ethnic group in Serbia and they represent 83% of the total population.
With a population of 290.000, Hungarians are the second largest ethnic group in Serbia,
representing 3.9% (and 14.3% of the population in Vojvodina). Other minority groups include
Bosniaks , Roma , Albanians , Croats , Bulgarians , Montenegrins , Slovaks , Vlachs and
Romanians . [113] According to the UN assessments, about 500,000 Roma live in Serbia. [114]
The German minority in the northern province of Vojvodina was more numerous in the past
(336,430 in 1900, or 23.5% of the population). [115]

Refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Serbia form between 7% and 7.5% of its
population – about half a million refugees sought refuge in the country following the
series of Yugoslav wars , mainly from Croatia, and to a lesser extent from Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the IDPs from Kosovo, which are currently the most numerous at over 200,000.
Serbia has the largest refugee population in Europe. [116]

On the other hand, it is estimated that 300,000 people have left Serbia during the '90s alone,
and around 20% of those had college or higher education. [117] [118] Serbia has comparatively
very old overall population (among the top 10 oldest in the world), mostly due to low level of
fertility. In addition, Serbia has among the highest negative growth population rates in the
world, ranking 225th out of 233 countries overall. [119] Ethnic groups in Serbia (excluding

Religion

Main article: Religion in Serbia Religious groups in Serbia (excluding Kosovo) in 2002 [113]
          Eastern Orthodoxy    84.1% Roman Catholicism    6.24% Islam    3.42%
Protestantism    1.44%

For centuries straddling the religious boundary between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism ,
joined up later by Islam, Serbia remains one of the most diverse countries on the continent.
While formation of the nation-state and turbulent history of 19th and 20th century has left
its traces on the religious landscape of the country: Vojvodina is still 25% Catholic or
Protestant , while Central Serbia and Belgrade regions are over 90% Orthodox Christian .
[113] Kosovo consists of a 90% Albanian Muslim majority.

Cathedral of Saint Sava , largest Orthodox church in the world.

Among the Eastern Orthodox Churchs , the Serbian Orthodox Church is the largest. According to
the 2002 Census, [123] 82% of the population of Serbia, excluding Kosovo, or 6,2 million
people declared their nationality as Serbian, who are overwhelmingly adherents of the
Serbian Orthodox Church. Other Orthodox Christian communities in Serbia include
Romanians, Vlachs, Macedonians and Bulgarians . Together they comprise about 84% of the
entire population.

Catholicism is mostly present in Vojvodina, especially its northern part, which is home to
minority ethnic groups such as Hungarians, Slovaks, Croats, Bunjevci , and Czechs. There are
an estimated 388,000 baptized Catholics in Serbia, roughly 6.2% of the population, mostly in
northern Serbia. [113]

Protestantism accounts for about 1.1% of the country's population, chiefly among Reformist
Hungarians and Slovaks in Vojvodina . Islam has a strong historic following in the southern
regions of Serbia – Raška and Preševo Valley municipalities in the south-east. Bosniaks
are the largest Muslim community in Serbia with 140,000 followers or 2% of the total
population, followed by Albanians, [113] whereas some Roma are Muslim.

With the exile of Jews from Spain during the Inquisition era, thousands of escaping families
and individuals made their way through Europe to the Balkans. A goodly number settled in
Serbia and became part of the general population. They were well-accepted and during the
ensuing generations the majority assimilated or became traditional or secular, rather than
remain orthodox as had been the original immigrants. Later on the wars that ravaged the region
resulted in a great part of the Serbian Jewish population emigrating from the region. [

one-third of the world's raspberries are grown in Serbia.

With a GDP PPP for 2010 estimated at $80.602 billion [3] or $10,897 per capita PPP , Serbia is an
upper-middle income economy by the World Bank . [124] Foreign Direct Investment in 2006 was
$5.85 billion or €4.5 billion. FDI for 2007 reached $4.2 Billion while real GDP per capita
figures are estimated to have reached $6,781 in April 2009. [3] The GDP growth rate showed
increase by 6.3% in 2005, [125] 5.8% in 2006, [126] reaching 7.5% in 2007 and 8.7% in 2008 [127]
as the fastest growing economy in the region. [128] According to Eurostat data, Serbian PPS
GDP per capita stood at 37% of the EU average in 2008. [129]

The economy has a high unemployment rate of 14% [130] and a unfavourable trade deficit. The
country expects some major economic impulses and high growth rates in the next years. Given
its recent high economic growth rates, which averaged 6.6% in the last three years, foreign
analysts have sometimes labeled Serbia as the "Balkan Tiger".

Apart from its free-trade agreement with the EU as its associate member , Serbia is the only
European country outside the former USSR to have free trade agreements with the Russian
Federation and, more recently, Belarus . [131] Apart from its favorable economic agreements
with both the East and West, such steps could be soon undertaken with Turkey and Iran . [132] By
doing this Serbia hopes to set up an export-oriented economy. [132]

Blue-chip corporations investing in Serbia include: US Steel , Philip Morris , Microsoft ,
Fiat , Coca-Cola , Lafarge , Siemens , Carlsberg and others. [133] In the energy, Russian
giants Lukoil and Gazprom have invested heavily. [134] The banking sector has attracted
investments from Banca Intesa Italy, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale France, HVB
Bank Germany, Erste Bank Austria, Eurobank EFG and Piraeus Bank Greece, and others. [135]
U.S. based Citibank, opened a representative office in Belgrade in December 2006. [136] In
the trade sector, biggest foreign investors are France's Intermarche , German Metro Cash &
Carry , Greek Veropoulos , and Slovenian Mercator . Serbia grows about one-third of the
world's raspberries and is the leading frozen fruit exporter. [137]

Communication

89% of households in Serbia have fixed telephone lines, and with over 9.60 million users the
number of cell-phones surpasses the number of total population population of Serbia itself
by 30%. Largest cellphone providers are Telekom Srbija with 5.65 million subscribers,
Telenor with 3.1 million users and Vip mobile covering the rest of the population. [138] 46.8%
of households have computers, 36.7% use the internet, and 42% have cable TV, which puts the
country ahead of certain member states of the EU. [139] [140] [141] [142] Serbia is ranked 59th
in the world in terms of Internet usage out of 216 states by the CIA World Factbook. [143] With
55,9% of its population using the internet, Serbia is ahead of all Balkan countries. [144]

Tesla Airport is Serbia's largest airport

Serbia owns one of the world's oldest airline carriers, Jat Airways , founded in 1927. [145]
There are 4 international airports in Serbia: Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport , Niš
Constantine the Great Airport and Vršac international airport as well as one in Kosovo,
Pristina International Airport .

Historians have labeled Serbia, and especially the valley of the Morava , as "the crossroads
between East and West", which is one of the primary reasons for its turbulent history. The
Morava valley route, which avoids mountainous regions, is by far the easiest way of traveling
overland from continental Europe to Greece and Asia Minor . Modern Serbia was the first among
its neighbors to buy railroads- in 1858 the first train arrived to Vrsac , then
Austria-Hungary [146] (by 1882 route to Belgrade and Niš was completed). Serbian Railways
handles the entire railway links in Serbia.

European routes E65 , E70 , E75 and E80 , as well as the E662, E761, E762, E763, E771, and E851 pass
through the country. The E70 westwards from Belgrade and most of the E75 are modern highways of
motorway / autobahn standard or close to that. As of 2005, Serbia has 1,481,498 registered
cars, 16,042 motorcycles, 9,626 buses, 116,440 trucks, 28,222 special transport vehicles,
126,816 tractors, and 101,465 trailers. [147]

Although landlocked, there are around 2000 km of navigable rivers and canals, the largest
of which are: the Danube , Sava , Tisa , joined by the Timiş River and Begej , all of which connect
Serbia with Northern and Western Europe through the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal and North
Sea route, to Eastern Europe via the Tisa, Timiş, Begej and Danube Black Sea routes, and to
Southern Europe via the Sava river. The two largest Serbian cities – Belgrade and Novi Sad ,
as well as Smederevo – are major regional Danubian harbours. [148] The Danube River,
central Europe's connection to the Black Sea, flows through Serbia. Through
Danube-Rhine-Main canal the North Sea is also accessible. Tisza river offers a connection
with Eastern Europe while the Sava river connects her to western former Yugoslav republics
near the Adriatic Sea.

Most of the energy is currently produced comes from coal or hydroelectric dams. Energy
consumption is expected to exceed energy production by 2012 and Elektroprivreda Srbije ,
Serbia's largest energy producer, is expected to develop Đerdap III (Ђердап III), a
hydroelectric dam with approximately 2.4 gigawatts of power. [151]

Naftna Industrija Srbije (Нафтна Индустрија Србије / Naftna
industrija Srbije), Serbia's largest oil producer was recently acquired by Russian energy
giant Gazprom . The two companies, are planning to build the Serbian portion of the South
Stream gas pipeline . The two companies are also building a 300 million cubic meters gas
storage at Banatski Dvor , located approximately 60 kilometers northeast of Novi Sad .

For centuries straddling the boundaries between East and West, Serbia had been divided
among: the Eastern and Western halves of the Roman Empire ; between Kingdom of Hungary ,
Bulgarian Empire , Frankish Kingdom and Byzantium ; and between the Ottoman Empire and the
Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary, as well as Venice in the south. The result of these
overlapping influences are distinct characters and sharp contrasts between various
Serbian regions, its north being more tied to Western Europe and south leaning towards the
Balkans and the Mediterranean Sea.



The Byzantine Empire 's influence on Serbia was profound, through the introduction of Greek
Orthodoxy from the 7th century onwards to today, the Serbian Orthodox Church has an
overwhelming influence on the makeup of cultural objects in Serbia. Different influences
were also present- chiefly the Ottoman, Hungarian , Austrian and also Venetian , also known as
coastal Serbs . Serbs use both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets .

The monasteries of Serbia , built largely in the Middle Ages , are one of the most valuable and
visible traces of medieval Serbia's association with the Byzantium and the Orthodox World,
but also with the Romanic Western Europe that Serbia had close ties with back in Middle Ages.
Most of Serbia's queens still remembered today in Serbian history were of foreign origin,
including Hélène d'Anjou , a cousin of Charles I of Sicily , Anna Dondolo, daughter of the
Doge of Venice , Enrico Dandolo , Catherine of Hungary, and Symonide of Byzantium .

Serbia has eight cultural sites marked on the UNESCO World Heritage list : Stari Ras and
Sopoćani monasteries added to the Heritage list in 1979, Studenica Monastery added in 1986,
the Medieval Serbian Monastic Complex in Kosovo, comprising: Dečani Monastery , Our Lady of
Ljeviš , Gračanica and Patriarchate of Pec , monestaties were added in 2004, and put on the
endangered list in 2006, and Gamzigrad – Romuliana, Palace of Galerius , was added in 2007.
Likewise, there are 2 literary memorials added on the UNESCO 's list as a part of the Memory of
the World Programme : Miroslav Gospels , handwriting from the 12th century, added in 2005, and
Nikola Tesla 's archive added in 2003.

The most prominent museum in Serbia is the National Museum , founded in 1844; it houses a
collection of more than 400,000 exhibits, over 5600 paintings and 8400 drawings and prints,
and includes many foreign masterpiece collections and the famous Miroslavljevo
Jevanđelje . Currently museum is under reconstruction. The museum is situated in Belgrade .

Stojanović Mokranjac

Composer and musicologist Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac is considered one of the most
important founders of modern Serbian music. [152] Born in 1856, Mokranjac taught music,
collected Serbian traditional songs and did the first scholarly research on Serbian music.
He was also the director of the first Serbian School of Music and one of the founders of the Union
of Singing Societies. His most famous works are the Song Wreaths . The Serbian composers Petar
Konjović , Stevan Hristić and Miloje Milojević , all born in the 1880s, were the most
eminent composers of their generation. They maintained the national expression and
modernized the romanticism into the direction of impressionism. The best-known composers
born around 1910 studied in Europe, mostly in Prague. Ljubica Marić , Stanojlo Rajicić ,
Milan Ristić took influence from Schoenberg, Hindemith and Haba, rejecting the
"conservative" work of prior Serbian composers, seeing it as outdated and the wish for
national expression was outside their interest. [153] Other famous classical Serbian
composers include Isidor Bajić , Stanislav Binički , and Josif Marinković

The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , was not an Eastern Bloc country, but a member of
the Non-Aligned Movement and as such, it was far more open to western influences compared to
the other socialist states (the West to some extent even supported Yugoslavia as a "buffer
zone" to the Warsaw Pact ). The western-influenced pop and rock music was socially accepted,
the Yugoslav rock scene was well developed and covered in the media, which included numerous
magazines, radio and TV shows. With the breakout of Yugoslav wars , former Yugoslav rock scene
ceased to exist. During the 1990s popularity of rock music declined in Serbia, and although
several major mainstream acts managed to sustain their popularity, an underground and
independent music scene developed. The 2000s saw the revival of the mainstream scene. The
most notable Serbian rock acts include Bajaga i Instruktori , Đorđe Balašević ,
Ekatarina Velika , Električni Orgazam , Galija , Idoli , Korni Grupa , Orthodox Celts ,
Partibrejkers , Pekinška Patka , Rambo Amadeus , Riblja Čorba , Smak , Šarlo Akrobata , YU
grupa , Van Gogh , and others.

urbanization of folk music. In its early times, it had a professional approach to
performance, used accordion and clarinet and typically included love songs or other simple
lyrics. of the genre's best performers also play forms imported from even further abroad.

influences from pop music , oriental music, and other genres, which led to the emergence of
turbo folk .

Turbo-folk (a term coined by rock musician Rambo Amadeus ) music emerged during the Yugoslav
wars and the breakup of Yugoslavia. Turbo-folk used Serbian folk music and
"novokomponovana" as the basis, and added influences from rock, pop and electronic dance
music . In the 2000s turbo-folk featured even more pop music elements, and some of the
performers were labeled as pop-folk. Some of the best known turbo-folk perfromers include

others.

Brass bands , known as "trubači" (трубачи, the trumpeters ) are extremely popular,
especially in Central and Southern Serbia where Balkan Brass Band originated. The music is
traditional from the First Serbian Uprising . The trumpet was used as a military instrument to
wake and gather soldiers and announce battles, the trumpet took on the role of entertainment
during downtime, as soldiers used it to transpose popular folk songs. When the war ended and
the soldiers returned to the rural life, the music entered civilian life and eventually
became a music style, accompanying births, baptisms, weddings, slavas , farewell parties
for those joining military service, state and church festivals, harvesting, reaping, and
funerals. In 1831 the first official military band was formed by Prince Miloš Obrenović .
Roma пеопле have adopted the tradition and enhanced the music, and today most of the
best performers are Roma.

Marković and are also the biggest names in the world of modern brass band bandleaders. Guča

Internationally famous Serbian film director Emir Kusturica

Serbia has a well-established theatrical tradition with many theaters. The Serbian
National Theatre was established in 1861 with its building dating from 1868. The company
started performing opera from the end of the 19th century and the permanent opera was
established in 1947. It established a ballet company. Bitef , Belgrade International
Theatre Festival, is one of the oldest theatre festivals in the world. New Theatre Tendencies
is the constant subtitle of the Festival. Founded in 1967, Bitef has continually followed and
supported the latest theater trends. It has become one of five most important and biggest
European festivals. It has become one of the most significant culture institutions of
Serbia.

Cinema prospered after World War II. The most notable postwar director was Dušan Makavejev
who was internationally recognised for Love Affair: Or the Case of the Missing Switchboard
Operator in 1969 focussing on Yugoslav politics. Makavejev's Montenegro was made in Sweden
in 1981. Zoran Radmilović was one of the most notable actors of the postwar period. Serbian
cinema continued to make progress despite the turmoil in the 1990s. Emir Kusturica won a
Golden Palm for Best Feature Film at the Cannes Film Festival for Underground in 1995. In 1998,
Kusturica won a Silver Lion for directing Black Cat, White Cat . As at 2001, there were 167
cinemas in Central Serbia and Vojvodina combined, and over 4 million Serbs went to the cinema

Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts directs a number of scientific research projects,
including many influential philosophical papers on government and national policies that
have helped shaped the Serbian society since 1886.

Education in Serbia is regulated by the Ministry of Education. Education starts in either
pre-schools or elementary schools. Children enroll in elementary schools ( Serbian :
Osnovna škola / Основна школа ) at the age of seven, and remain there for eight
years. After compulsory education students have the opportunity to either attend a high
school for another four years, specialist school, for 2 to 4 years, or to enroll in vocational
training, for 2 to 3 years. Following the completion of high school or a specialist school,
students have the opportunity to attend university.

    In Serbia, some of the largest universities are:

    - University of Belgrade

    

    - University of Kragujevac

    

    - University of Niš

    

    - University of Novi Sad

    

    - University of Pristina

    

    - University of Novi Pazar

    



The University of Belgrade is the oldest and currently the biggest university in Serbia.

330,000 graduates. Other universities with a significant number of faculty and alumni are
those of Novi Sad (founded 1960), Kragujevac (founded 1976) and Niš (founded 1965).

The roots of the Serbian education system date back to the 11th and 12th centuries when the
first Catholic colleges were founded in Titel and Bač , in Vojvodina province. Medieval
Serbian education, however, was mostly conducted through the Serbian Orthodox monasteries
of Sopoćani , Studenica , and Patriarchate of Peć . Serbian Orthodox education starting
from the rise of Raška in 12th century, when Serbs overwhelmingly embraced Orthodoxy rather
than Catholicism. The oldest college faculty within current borders of Serbia dates back to
1778; founded in the city of Sombor , then Habsburg Empire , it was known under the name Norma and
was the oldest Slavic Teacher's college in Southern Europe. [ citation needed ]
