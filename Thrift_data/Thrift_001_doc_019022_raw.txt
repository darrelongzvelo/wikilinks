A navy is the branch of a country's military forces principally designated for naval warfare
and amphibious warfare namely lake - or ocean -borne combat operations and related
functions. It includes operations conducted by surface ships , amphibious ships ,
submarines , and seaborne aviation , as well as ancillary support, communications,
training, and other fields; recent developments have included space related operations.
The strategic offensive role of a Navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's
shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or
shore installations). The strategic defensive purpose of a Navy is to frustrate sea-borne
projection-of-force by enemies. The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear
deterrence by use of nuclear missiles. //<![CDATA[ if (window.showTocToggle) { var

Victory , the oldest warship still in commission in the world.

Naval warfare developed when humans first fought from water-borne vessels. Prior to the
introduction of the cannon and ships with sufficient capacity to carry the large guns, navy
warfare primarily involved ramming and boarding actions. In the time of ancient Greece and
the Roman Empire , naval warfare centered on long, narrow vessels powered by banks of oarsmen
(such as triremes and quinqueremes ) designed to ram and sink enemy vessels or come alongside
the enemy Nublets so its occupants could be attacked hand-to-hand. Naval warfare continued
in this vein through the Middle Ages until cannon became commonplace and capable of being
reloaded quickly enough to be reused in the same battle. The Chola Dynasty of medieval India
was known as a one of the greatest naval powers of its time in the Indian Ocean . In ancient China ,
large naval battles were known since the Qin Dynasty ( also see Battle of Red Cliffs , 208 ),
employing the war junk during the Han Dynasty . However, China's first official standing navy
was not established until the Southern Song Dynasty in the 12th century , a time when gunpowder
was a revolutionary new application to warfare

The mass and deck space required to carry a large number of cannon made oar-based propulsion
impossible and ships came to rely primarily on sails . Warships were designed to carry
increasing numbers of cannon and naval tactics evolved to bring a ship's firepower to bear in a
broadside , with ships-of-the-line arranged in a line of battle .

The development of large capacity, sail-powered ships carrying cannon led to a rapid
expansion of European navies, especially the Spanish and Portuguese navies which dominated
in the 16th and early 17th centuries, and ultimately helped propel the age of exploration and
colonialism .The repulsion of the Spanish Armada ( 1588 ) by the English fleet revolutionized
naval warfare by the success of a guns-only strategy and caused a major overhaul of the Spanish
navy , partly along English lines, which resulted in even greater dominance by the Spanish.
From the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch cannibalized the Portuguese Empire in the
East and, with the immense wealth gained, challenged Spanish hegemony at sea. From the 1620s ,
Dutch raiders seriously troubled Spanish shipping and, after a number of battles which went
both ways, the Dutch Navy finally broke the long dominance of the Spanish Navy in the Battle of
the Downs ( 1639 ).

England emerged as a major naval power in the mid-17th century in the first Anglo-Dutch war
with a technical victory but successive decisive Dutch victories in the second and third
Anglo-Dutch Wars confirmed the Dutch mastery of the seas during the Dutch Golden Age ,
financed by the expansion of the Dutch Empire . The French Navy won some important victories
near the end of the 17th century but a focus upon land forces led to the French Navy's relative
neglect, which allowed the Royal Navy to emerge with an ever-growing advantage in size and
quality, especially in tactics and experience, from 1695 . Throughout the 18th century the
Royal Navy gradually gained ascendancy over the French Navy, with victories in the War of
Spanish Succession ( 1701 - 1714 ), inconclusive battles in the War of Austrian Succession (
1740 - 1748 ), victories in the Seven Years' War ( 1754 - 1763 ), a partial reversal during the
American War of Independence ( 1775 - 1783 ), and consolidation into uncontested supremacy
during the 19th century from the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . These conflicts saw the
development and refinement of tactics which came to be called the line of battle .

supercarrier USS Nimitz (CVN-68)

The next stage in the evolution of naval warfare was the introduction of metal plating along
the hull sides. The increased mass required steam-powered engines, resulting in an arms race
between armor and weapon thickness and firepower. The first armored vessels, the French FS
Gloire and British HMS Warrior , made wooden vessels obsolete. Another significant
improvement came with the invention of the rotating turrets, which allowed the guns to be
aimed independently of ship movement. The battle between the CSS Virginia and the USS Monitor
during the American Civil War is often cited as the beginning of this age of maritime conflict.
A further step change in naval firepower occurred when the United Kingdom launched HMS
Dreadnought , but naval tactics still emphasized the line of battle.

The first practical military submarines were developed in the late 19th century and by the end
of World War I had proven to be a powerful arm of naval warfare. During World War II the German
Navy 's submarine fleet of U-boats almost starved the United Kingdom into submission and
inflicted tremendous losses on US coastal shipping . The German battleship Tirpitz , a sister
ship of the Bismarck , was almost put out of action by miniature submarines known as X-Craft .
The X-Craft severely damaged her and kept her in port for some months.

A major paradigm shift in naval warfare occurred with the introduction of the aircraft
carrier . First at Taranto in 1940 and then in Pearl Harbor in 1941 , the carrier demonstrated
its ability to strike decisively at enemy ships out of sight and range of surface vessels. The
Battle of Leyte Gulf ( 1944 ) was arguably the largest naval battle in history ; it was also the
last battle in which battleships played a significant role. By the end of World War II , the
carrier had become the dominant force of naval warfare.

World War II also saw the United States become by far the largest Naval power in the world with
over 70% of the world's total numbers and total tonnage of naval vessels of 1000 tons or
greater. [1] Throughout the rest of the 20th century The United States Navy would maintain a
tonnage greater than that of the next 17 largest navies combined. [2]

Historically a national navy operates from one or more bases that are maintained by the
country or an ally. The base is a port that is specialized in naval operations, and often
includes housing for off-shore crew, an arsenal depot for munitions, docks for the vessels,
and various repair facilities. During times of war temporary bases may be constructed in
closer proximity to strategic locations, as it is advantageous in terms of patrols and
station-keeping. Nations with historically strong naval forces have found it advantageous
to obtain basing rights in areas of strategic interest.

Navy ships normally operate with a group, which may be a small squadron of comparable ships, or
a larger naval fleet of various specialized ships. The commander of a fleet travels in the flag
ship , which is usually the most powerful vessel in the group. Prior to the invention of radio,
commands from the flag ship were communicated by means of flags. At night signal lamps could be
used for a similar purpose. Later these were replaced by the radio transmitter, or the
flashing light when radio silence was needed.

A " blue water navy " is designed to operate far from the coastal waters of its home nation. These
are ships capable of maintaining station for long periods of time in deep ocean, and will have a
long logistical tail for their support. Many are also nuclear powered to save having to
refuel. By contrast a " brown water navy " operates in the coastal periphery and along inland
waterways, where larger ocean-going naval vessels can not readily enter. Regional powers
may maintain a " green water navy " as a means of localized force projection. Blue water fleets
may require specialized vessels, such as mine sweepers , when operating in the littoral
regions along the coast.



[ edit ] Traditions

Image: http://en.wikipedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png Ship bell
of ORP Iskra II - Polish Navy school tall ship

A basic tradition is that all ships commissioned in a navy are referred to as ships rather than
vessels. The prefix on a ship's name indicates that it is a commissioned ship. For example, USS
is an acronym which expands to United States Ship; in the Royal Navy, HMS expands to Her
Majesty's Ship (or when a King reigns, His Majesty's Ship), and so forth.

An important tradition on board British naval vessels (and later those of the U.S. and other
nations) has been the ship's bell . This was historically used to mark the passage of time on
board a vessel, including the duration of four-hour watches. They were also employed as
warning devices in heavy fog, and for alarms and ceremonies. The bell was originally kept
polished first by the ship's cook, then later by a person belonging to that division of the
ship's personnel.

Another important tradition is that of Piping someone aboard the ship. This was originally
used to give orders on warships when shouted orders could not have been heard. The piping was
done by the ship's boatswain and therefore the instrument is known as the boatswain's Pipe.
The two tones it gives and the number of blasts given off, signify the order given. It is also
used in a ceremonial way, i.e., to "pipe" someone aboard the ship - usually captains,
including the ship's captain, and more senior officers.

In the United States, in a tradition that dates back to the Revolutionary War , the First Navy
Jack is a flag that has the words, "Don't Tread on Me" on the flag.

By European tradition, ships have been referred to as a "she". However, it was long considered
bad luck to permit women to sail on board naval vessels. To do so would invite a terrible storm
that would wreck the ship. The only women that were welcomed on board were figureheads mounted
on the prow of the ship. In spite of these views, some women did serve on board naval vessels,
usually as wives of crewmembers.

Even today, despite their acceptance in many areas of naval service, women are still not
permitted to serve on board U.S. submarines . The major reasons cited by the U.S. Navy are the
extended duty tours and close conditions which afford almost no privacy. [1] The UK Royal Navy
has similar restrictions. Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway have opened submarine
service to women sailors, however. [2]

By ancient tradition, corpses on board naval vessels were buried at sea . In the past this
involved sewing the body up in a shroud that had a weight at one end, often a cannonball . (During
the age of sail, the final stitch was placed through the nose of the victim, just to make sure
they were really dead.) The body was then placed on a pivoting table attached to the outer hull,
and shrouded by a national ensign. After a solemn ceremony, the board was tilted and the body
dropped into the deep. Later ceremonies employed the casket or crematory urn.

The custom of firing cannon salutes originated in the British Royal Navy . When a cannon is
fired, it partially disarms the ship, so firing a cannon for no combat reason showed respect
and trust. The British, as the dominant naval power, compelled the ships of weaker nations to
make the first salute. As the tradition evolved, the number of cannon fired became an
indication of the rank of the official being saluted.

Historically, navy ships were primarily intended for warfare. They were designed to
withstand damage and to inflict the same, but only carried munitions and supplies for the
voyage (rather than merchant cargo). Often, other ships which were not built specifically
for warfare, such as the galleon or the armed merchant ships in World War II , did carry
armaments. In more recent times, navy ships have become more specialized and have included
supply ships, troop transports, repair ships, oil tankers and other logistics support ships
as well as combat ships. So long as they are commissioned, however, they are all "ships".

Modern navy combat ships are generally divided into seven main categories: aircraft
carriers , cruisers , destroyers , frigates , corvettes , submarines , and amphibious assault
ships . There are also support and auxiliary ships, including the minesweeper , patrol boat ,
and tender . During the age of sail , the ship categories were divided into the ship of the line ,
frigate , and sloop-of-war .

Naval ship names are typically prefixed by an abbreviation indicating the national navy in
which they serve. For a list of the prefixes used with ship names ( HMS , USS , etc.) see ship
prefix .

Today ships are significantly faster than in former times, thanks to much improved
propulsion systems. Also, the efficiency of the engines has improved a lot, in terms of fuel,
and of how many sailors it takes to operate them. In World War II, ships needed to refuel very
often. However, today ships can go on very long journeys without refueling. Also, in World War
II, the engine room needed about a dozen sailors to work the many engines, however, today, only
about 4-5 are needed (depending on the class of the ship). Today, naval strike groups on longer
missions are always followed by a range of support and replenishment ships supplying them
with anything from fuel and munitions, to medical treatment and postal services. This allows
strike groups and combat ships to remain at sea for several months at a time.



[ edit ] Navy boats



Many people make the mistake of calling a ship a "boat". The term "boat" refers to small craft
limited in their use by size and usually not capable of making independent voyages of any
length on the high seas. The old navy adage to differentiate between ships and boats is that
boats are capable of being carried by ships. (Submarines by this rule are ships rather than
boats, but are customarily referred to as boats reflecting their previous smaller size.) The
Navy uses thousands of boats, ranging from 9-foot dinghies to 135-foot landing craft. They
are powered by either diesels, out-board gasoline motors, or waterjets. Most boats are built
of aluminum, fiberglass, or steel. Newer Navy boats are designed and built using the
International System of units (also known as SI or metric), but older craft were designed
using the English units system (feet, inches etc.)

Standard Boats A standard boat is a small craft carried aboard a ship to perform various tasks
and evolutions.

Landing Craft These boats, carried by various amphibious ships, are designed to carry
troops, vehicles, or cargo from ship to shore under combat conditions, to unload, to retract
from beach, and to return to the ship. They are especially rugged, with powerful engines, and
they are armed. They are usually referred to by their designations such as LCPL (landing
craft, personnel) LCM (landing craft mechanized) or LCU (landing craft, utility) rather
than by full name. The most common in today's Navy are the LCMs. there are two types of LCMs. Both
types have a power operated bow ramp, a cargo well, twin engines, and after structures that
house enginerooms, pilot houses, and stowage compartments. The larger version, designated
LCM-8 and often called "mike 8", is 74 feet long, has a 21-foot beam, and is capable of carrying a
heavy tank or 60 tons of cargo. The LCM-6 ("mike 6") is 56 feet long, has a 14-foot beam and a cargo
capacity of 34 tons.

Landing Craft, Air Cushioned Known as LCAC also most commonly called a hover craft. Floats on a
cushion of air that allows travel over water and land. It can deliver troops, equipment, and
supplies. They are 81 feet long and carry a load more than 70 tons. Powered by four gas turbine
engines, they are capable of speeds as high as 50 knots.

Work Boats(WB) There are two types of WBs, the 35 foot and the 15 meter (or 50 foot). The 35 foot WB
is a twin screw craft with a forward cargo well and a bow ramp. The 35 foot WB is normally carried
on board salvage ships and is used to assist ships in salvage operations, underwater
exploration,coastal survey, repair of other craft, and cargo transport between ship to
shore. A portable "A frame" is used to assist with cargo handling. The 15 meter (50 foot) WB is a
twin screw craft with steel hull construction and is a shallow draft craft cargo carrier. The
15 meter (50 foot) WB is intended for general purpose missions and transportation of cargo.
the craft has a pilot house aft and forward cargo well deck.

Rigid hull Inflatable Boats Known as the RHIB they are versatile boats designed for service as
a standard ship's boat. The seven meter (24 foot) RHIB is a turbocharged, diesel powered craft
with a glass reinforced plastic (GRP) hull. The hull form is a combination of a rigid planing
hull with an inflatable tube. The craft are manned by three man crew and are provided with a
canvas canopy forward.

Personnel Boats (PE) These are fast, V bottomed, diesel powered boats with enclosed spaces
specifically designed to transport officers, although smaller types are used for shore
party boats, lifeboats, and mail boats. They come in 8,10, and 12 meter (26,33, and 40 foot)
lengths. The 8 meter (26 foot) boats have one enclosed cabin. The 10 and 12 meter (33 and 40 foot)
boats have enclosed cabins forward and aft, and open cockpits amidships where coxswains
steer by wheel. Those designed for officers are painted haze gray with white cabins. Those
assigned for use by commanding officers, chief of staff, and squadron, patrol, or division
commanders are called gigs and have a red stripe added just above the waterline. Personnel
boats assigned to flag officers (admirals) are called barges. They have black hulls and a
white stripes just above the waterline.

Utility Boats These boats, varying in length from 18 feet to 15 meters (50 feet) are mainly
cargo and personnel carrier or heavy duty work boats. Many have been modified for survey work,
tending divers, and minesweeping operations. In ideal weather, a 15 meter(50 foot) UB will
carry 146 people, plus crew. Utility boats are open boats, though many of the larger ones are
provided with canvas canopies. The smaller utility boats are powered by outboard engines.
The larger boats have diesel engines.

Punts These are open square enders, 14 feet long. They are either rowed or sculled, and are
generally used in port by side cleaners.

Special Boats These boats, used by shore stations and for special missions, are not normally
carried aboard ships a are the standard boats discussed above. They include line handling
boats, buoy boats, aircraft rescue boats, torpedo retrievers, explosive ordnance disposal
craft, utility boats, dive boats, targets, and various patrol boats. Many standard boats
have been modified for special service.

Mark V Special operations craft (SOC) This craft is also used for insertion and extraction of
special warfare personnel. The craft is 82 feet long, and has twain diesel engines driving
waterjets. The craft is capable of speeds in excess of 50 knots and is air deployable.

Patrol Boats, River (PBR) This is a 31 foot, 25 knots, twin diesel boats with a fiberglass hull
and waterjet pump propulsion that permits it to operate in 15 inches of water. The PBR is highly
maneuverable and can reverse course in its own length. It carries radar, communications
equipment, and machine guns



[ edit ] Navy units



Naval forces are typically arranged into units based on the number of ships included, a single
ship being the smallest operational unit. Ships may be combined into squadrons or flotillas ,
which may be formed into fleets . The largest unit size may be the whole Navy or Admiralty .



[ edit ] Naval ranks

    

        Main article: Naval officer ranks

    



A navy will typically have two sets of ranks, one for enlisted personnel and one for officers .

    Typical ranks for commissioned officers include the following, in ascending order (
    Commonwealth ranks are listed first on each line):

    - Acting Sub-Lieutenant / Ensign / Corvette Lieutenant

    

    - Sub Lieutenant / Lieutenant Junior Grade / Frigate Lieutenant

    

    - Lieutenant / Ship-of-the-Line Lieutenant / Captain Lieutenant

    

    - Lieutenant Commander / Corvette Captain

    

    - Commander / Frigate Captain

    

    - Captain / Ship-of-the-Line Captain

    

    - Commodore / Flotilla Admiral (in USA only: Rear Admiral (lower half) )

    

    - Rear Admiral (in USA only: Rear Admiral (upper half) )

    

    - Vice Admiral

    

    - Admiral

    

    - Fleet Admiral or Admiral of the Fleet or Grand Admiral

    



"Flag officers" include any rank that includes the word "admiral" (or commodore), and are
generally in command of a battle group or similar flotilla of ships, rather than a single ship
or aspect of a ship. However, commodores can also be temporary positions. For example, during
World War II, a Navy captain was assigned duty as a convoy commodore, which meant that he was
still a captain, but in charge of all the merchant vessels in the convoy. The most senior rank
employed by a navy will tend to vary depending on the size of the navy and whether it is wartime or
peacetime, for example, few people have ever held the rank of Fleet Admiral in the U.S. Navy,
the chief of the Royal Australian Navy holds the rank of Vice Admiral, and the chief of the Irish
Naval Service holds the rank of Commodore.



[ edit ] Marine troops

    

        Main article: Marine (military)

    



During the era of the Roman empire , the naval forces included legionaries for boarding
actions . These were troops primarily trained in land warfare, and did not need to be skilled at
handling a ship. Much later during the age of sail, a component of marines served a similar
role, being ship-borne soldiers who were used either during boarding actions, as
sharp-shooters, or in raids along the shore.

The Spanish InfanterÃ­a de Marina was formed in 1537, making it the oldest current marine
corps in the world. The United States Marine Corps became a separate arm in the United States
military, with their own equipment. However the U.S. Navy SEALs and the British Royal Marines
now serve a similar function, being a ship-based force specially-trained in commando -style
operations and tactics as part of the navy. The Royal Marines also have their own special
forces, the SBS ( Special Boat Service ); similar to the US Navy SEALs and the Boat Troops of the
SAS.



[ edit ] Etymology



"Navy" came via Old French from Latin navigium = "fleet of ships" from navis = "ship" and agere =
"to drive" (as in driving a herd of animals) or "to get something done".

"Naval" came from Latin navalis = "pertaining to ship" (which it means in the biological name
Teredo navalis ), but due to resemblance became changed to "pertaining to navy". 0 comments

Panthera tigris ) is a tiger with a genetic condition that nearly eliminates pigment in the
normally orange fur although they still have dark stripes. This occurs when a tiger inherits
two copies of the recessive gene for the paler coloration: pink nose, grey-mottled skin,
ice-blue eyes, and white to cream-coloured fur with black, grey, or chocolate-coloured
stripes. (Another genetic condition also makes the stripes of the tiger very pale; white
tigers of this type are called snow-white .)

White tigers do not constitute a separate subspecies of their own and can breed with orange
ones, although all of the resulting offspring will be heterozygous for the recessive white
gene, and their fur will be orange. The only exception would be if the orange parent was itself
already a heterozygous tiger , which would give each cub a 50% chance of being either
double-recessive white or heterozygous orange.

Compared to orange tigers without the white gene, white tigers tend to be larger both at birth
and at full adult size. [1] This may have given them an advantage in the wild despite their
unusual coloration. Heterozygous orange tigers also tend to be larger than other orange
tigers. Kailash Sankhala , the director of the New Delhi Zoo in the 1960s, suggested that "one
of the functions of the white gene may have been to keep a size gene in the population, in case
it's ever needed."

Dark-striped white individuals are well-documented in the Bengal Tiger subspecies (
Panthera tigris tigris or P. t. bengalensis ), may also have occurred in captive Siberian
Tigers ( Panthera tigris altaica ), and may have been reported historically in several other
subspecies. White pelage is most closely associated with the Bengal , or Indian subspecies.
Currently, several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide with about 100 of them in
India, and their numbers are on the increase. The modern population includes both pure
Bengals and hybrid Bengal–Siberians, but it is unclear whether the recessive gene for
white came only from Bengals, or from any of the Siberian ancestors as well.

The unusual coloration of white tigers has made them popular in zoos and entertainment that
showcases exotic animals . The magicians Siegfried & Roy are famous for having bred and
trained white tigers for their performances, referring to them as "royal white tigers"
perhaps from the white tiger's association with the Maharaja of Rewa .

It is a myth that white tigers did not thrive in the wild, where small groups had bred white for
generations. India once planned to reintroduce them to the wild. [2] A.A. Dunbar Brander
wrote in "Wild Animals In Central India" (1923): "White tigers occasionally occur. There is a
regular breed of these animals in the neighborhood of Amarkantak at the junction of the Rewa
state and the Mandla and Bilaspur districts. When I was last in Mandla in 1919, a white tigress
and two three parts grown white cubs existed. In 1915 a male was trapped by the Rewa state and
kept in confinement. An excellent description of this animal by Mr. Scott of the Indian
police, has been published in Vol. XXVII, No. 47, of the Bombay Natural History Society's
journal." [3]

However, most white tigers are now bred in captivity, often by inbreeding parents and cubs to
ensure the presence of the recessive gene. Such inbreeding often also leads to birth defects .

[ edit ] Captive White Bengal Tiger Founders











Mohan is the founding father of the white tigers of Rewa [5] . He was captured as a cub in 1951 by
Maharaja Shri Martand Singh of Rewa, whose hunting party in Bandhavgarh found a tigress with
four 9-month-old cubs, one of which was white. All of them were shot except for the white cub.
The Maharaja of Rewa offered his guest, the Maharaja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur , the honor of
shooting the white cub, but he declined. After shooting a white tiger in 1948 the Maharaja of
Rewa had resolved to capture one, as his father had done in 1915, at his next opportunity. Water
was used to lure the thirsty cub into a cage, after he returned to a kill made by his mother, and
once captured he was housed in the unused palace at Govindgarh in the erstwhile harem
courtyard. The white cub mauled a man during the capture process and was clubbed on the head and
knocked unconscious. He wasn't necessarily expected to wake up and this was his second brush
with death. The Maharaja named him Mohan, which roughly translates as "Enchanter", one of the
many forms of the Hindu deity Krishna . The white tiger the previous Maharaja had kept in
captivity from 1915 to 1920 was also a male, unusually large like most white tigers (Mohan was
no exception in this regard), and was known to have a white male sibling that continued to live
in the wild. After it's death in 1920 it was mounted and presented to the Emperor King George V ,
as a token of loyalty. [2] This specimen is now in the British Museum , although it was not the
first white tiger to reach England: in 1820, London 's Exeter Change menagerie had a white
tiger which was examined by the famous French anatomist Georges Cuvier , who described it in
his "Animal Kingdom" as having faint stripes only visible from certain angles of refraction.
In 1960 there was a mounted white tiger, with faint reddish brown stripes, in the throne room of
the Maharaja of Rewa.

In 1953, Mohan was bred [6] to a normal-coloured wild tigress called Begum ("royal consort"),
which produced two male orange cubs on September 7 . In 1955 they had a litter of two males and two
females on April 10 (which included a male named Sampson and a female named Radha). On July 10 ,
1956 they again had a litter of two males and two females, which included a male named Sultan who
went to Ahmedabad Zoo, and a female named Vindhya who went to Delhi Zoo and was bred to an
unrelated male named Suraj. [7] These early breeding experiments failed to yield a single
white cub. [2]

Another maharaja, a cousin of the Maharaja of Rewa, recounted, "Rewa was frustrated. I told
him the answer-- incest of course!" [8] Mohan was then bred to his daughter Radha (who carried
the white gene inherited from him) and they produced a number of white cubs. The initial litter
of four cubs-- a male named Raja; three females named Rani, Mohini, and Sukishi-- were the
first white tigers born in captivity, on October 30 , 1958 . [9] [2] Raja and Rani went to the New
Delhi Zoo, and Mohini was bought by the German-American billionaire John Kluge [10] for
$10,000, for the Smithsonian National Zoological Park , as a gift to the children of America ,
in 1960. Sukeshi remained at Govindgarh Palace, in the harem courtyard where she was born, as a
mate for Mohan.

The Government of India made a deal with the Maharaja, under the terms of which Raja and Rani
would go to the New Delhi Zoo [11] [12] for free. In exchange the Maharaja's white tiger
breeding would be subsidized and he would receive a share of their cubs. He wanted Rs 100,000
for them. Technically Sukeshi was also the property of the New Delhi Zoo, and in a sense India
had nationalized the captive white tigers of Rewa. The Parliament of India used to hear
reports on the progress of the white tigers, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and U Nu of Burma
participated in public christening ceremonies for white cubs at New Delhi Zoo. President
Tito of Yugoslavia visited New Delhi Zoo and asked for white tigers for Belgrade Zoo, but was
refused [13] . A white tiger named Dalip from New Delhi Zoo represented India in two
international expositions in Budapest and Osaka . The government of West Bengal bought two
white males, named Niladari and Himadri, from the Maharaja for the Alipore Zoological
Gardens (Calcutta Zoo), and an orange female named Malini, from the same litter of three born
in 1960, accompanied them there. The Alipore Zoo in Kolkata , recovered the purchase price of
the white tigers within six months by charging extra to see them. Calcutta Zoo had a fine
specimen of a white tiger in 1920. Six zoos acquired white tigers from the Maharaja of Rewa
including the Bristol Zoo in England (a brother and sister pair named Champak and Chameli on
June 22, 1963) [14] [2] and the Crandon Park Zoo (which closed around 1983, and moved out of
Crandon Park to the site of the Miami MetroZoo ) in Miami acquired a white tigress in 1968.
Bristol Zoo's pair, born in 1962, came from another litter of four, all white, but two (one
female and one male) didn't survive. By 1966 the Bombay Zoo had a white tigress named Lakshmi,
born in 1964, from the Maharaja. The Calcutta Zoo sold a white tigress named Sefali to Gauhati
Zoo and sent a second white tiger there on loan. By 1976 the Lucknow Zoo also had a white tiger
which was a gift from New Delhi Zoo. A white tigress named Nandni, who was born in New Delhi Zoo in
1971, went to Hyderabad Zoo. [7] Zoos with white tigers constituted a most exclusive club and
the white tigers themselves represented a single extended family. The Maharaja was
negotiating the sale of a white male, named Virat, as late as 1976, when he died of enteritis .
Virat was a son of Mohan and Sukeshi and the maharaja put him on the market after attempting to
breed him to Sukeshi, [2] which would have raised the inbreeding coefficient.

India imposed an export ban on white tigers in 1960, [15] [16] [17] [18] , in an effort to
preserve a monopoly, probably because Anglo-Indian naturalist Edward Pritchard Gee
recommended that Govindgarh Palace, and it's white tiger inhabitants, be made a "national
trust", which didn't happen. After the export ban was imposed the Maharaja threatened to
release all of his white tigers into the Rewa forest, and so he was given dispensation to sell
two more pairs abroad, to offset his costs [19] . Mohini was only allowed to leave India because
US President Dwight D. Eisenhower intervened personally with Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru , to ask for the release of the United States government's white tiger. A white sister of
Mohini's was brought to New Delhi the year before to show the President, who was no stranger to
white tigers. Circus owner Clyde Beatty also bought a white tiger from the Maharaja in 1960,
for $10,000 in a deal facilitated by the Smithsonian National Zoological Park director T.H.
Reed, which had to be cancelled because of the export ban [20] , which made Mohini even more
valuable. She was estimated to be worth $28,000. Dr. Reed had travelled to India to escort
Mohini to Washington . Years later the Bristol Zoo needed a new breeding male and traded a white
female to New Delhi Zoo for a white tiger named Roop, who had been named by U Nu, the Prime
Minister of Burma. [2] He was the son of Raja by his own mother and half sister- Radha, born in New
Delhi. Radha, and many other tigers from Govindgarh including Sukeshi, were later
transferred to New Delhi. Begum went to live at Ahmedabad Zoo and was bred to her son Sultan.
They produced twelve cubs in four litters between 1958 and 1961. [7] Bristol Zoo later
transferred two male white tigers to Dudley Zoo . In 1951 the Maharaja placed ads in The New York
Times and The Times of London, and wrote to Gerald Iles, the director of the Belle Vue Zoo in
Manchester [21] , and probably others, offering to sell his captured white tiger cub. He
wanted the princely sum of $28,000 for Mohan. The Maharaja was prevented by law from
converting rupees into American dollars, and wanted the money to buy a speed boat. [22] [23]
[24] Mohan was featured in the National Geographic documentary "Great Zoos Of The World" in
1970. A photograph of his stuffed head, in a display case in the private museum of the Maharaja
of Rewa in Govindgarh Lake Palace, appears in the National Geographic book "The Year Of The
Tiger." [25]

Mohan died in 1970, aged almost 20, and was laid to rest with Hindu rites as the palace staff
observed official mourning. He was the last recorded white tiger born in the wild. The last
white tiger seen in the wild was shot in 1958. [2] The Maharaja of Rewa turned Mohan's native
forest into the Bandhavgarh National Park, because he couldn't control the poaching. Today
Bandhavgarh has the largest tiger population of any national park in India. Visitors can stay
at the White Tiger Lodge, which is the local version of Tiger Tops in Royal Chitwan in Nepal.
Pushpraj Singh, the reigning Maharaja of Rewa, is asking students to sign a petition to ask the
President of India to return at least two white tigers to Govindgarh Lake Palace, as a tourist
attraction. [26]



[ edit ] Mohini



Mohini , a daughter of Mohan, was officially presented to President Eisenhower by John W.
Kluge, in a ceremony on the White House lawn, on December 5 , 1960 , and went to live at the Lion
House, in the National Zoo, in Rock Creek Park . [27] [28] [29] T.H. Reed, the director of the
National Zoo, gave this description of Mohini: "Her stripes were black, shading into brown,
but her main coat was eggshell white instead of the normal rufous orange. Exotic coloring and
magnificent physique made her a tiger without peer. For a two year old kitten she had
tremendous growth-almost 190 pounds, three feet tall at the shoulders, and eight feet from
nose to tail." [10] White tigers are larger and heavier than regular orange tigers. The
average length of a white tiger at birth is 53 cm, compared to 50 cm for a normal orange cub.
Shoulder height is 17 cm (normal 12 cm), weight 1.37 kg (normal 1.25 kg). Dalip and Krishna, two
white tigers at New Delhi Zoo, weighed 139 kg and 120 kg respectively, at two years of age. Ram
and Jim, two normal colored tigers at the same zoo, weighed 106 kg and 119 kg, at the same age.
Raja, the white tiger, had a shoulder height of 100 cm, at ten years of age, while Suraj, an
orange tiger, had a shoulder height of only 90 cm, at 12 years of age, according to New Delhi Zoo
director K.S. Sankhala. Ratna and Vindhya, orange tigresses "from the white race", who
carried the white gene as a recessive (both were fathered by Mohan), were higher at the
shoulder than average, measuring 87 and 88 cm, compared to a normal orange tigress named
Asharfi, who measured 82 cm at the shoulder. [2] President Eisenhower was also given a rare
Pygmy Hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis), a male named Totota (see also Billy (pygmy
hippo) ), by William Tubman , President of Liberia , in 1960, and a 14 month old baby male African
elephant (Loxodonta africana), named Zimbo in 1959 by the director of the Vincennes Zoo in
Paris , on behalf of the French community.

After arriving in the United States, Mohini spent 1 night in the Bronx Zoo [30] , and was then
exhibited for three days in the Philadelphia Zoo [31] [32] , before travelling on to
Washington. [10] Her name is the feminine of Mohan, and translates as "Enchantress". She was
her father's namesake. She was a great attraction, and the zoo wanted to breed more white
tigers. At the time, no more white tigers were being allowed out of India, so Mohini was mated to
Sampson, her uncle and half brother, who was sent from Ahmedabad Zoo in 1963. [33] (It seems
probable that financial considerations may have also precluded Washington from acquiring a
second white tiger as a mate for Mohini.)

After Sampson's death in 1966, at age 11 of kidney failure , Mohini was bred to her son Ramana,
who was then the only male white gene carrier available. This resulted in the birth of a white
daughter named Rewati on April 13, 1969 [34] and a white son named Moni on Feb. 8, 1970. Moni died
of a neurological disorder in 1971 at 16 months. Moni was to have undertaken a fund raising tour
for Project Tiger . He was born in a litter of five, which included two white males and three
orange females. One was stillborn and the mother crushed the others after three days. Rewati
had an orange male littermate which died after two days. Ramana was born on July 1 , 1964 and had
two litter mates-a white male named Rajkumar, who was the first white tiger born in a zoo, and an
orange female named Ramani. Both died of feline distemper despite having been vaccinated, at
ten months age. Rajkumar had a particularly nasty disposition. All of Mohini's cubs were
named by the Indian Ambassador.

The birth of Mohini's first litter was televised in a national special. Mohini's orange
daughter Kesari was born in 1966 with an orange female who was stillborn. After Moni died in
1971 the National Zoo tried to acquire an orange tiger named Ram from Trivandrum Zoo, in
southern India, as a mate for Mohini [35] . Ram was her first cousin, a grandson of Mohan, and
there was a 50% chance that he carried white genes. 25% of Ram's genes came from Mohan and 25%
from Begum. 25% of Mohini's genes were from Begum and 75% from Mohan. Ram was a son of Vindhya and
Suraj born on 23 IV 1965 at New Delhi Zoo, the same Ram discussed earlier. Two sisters of Ram,
born on 22 Feb. 1967, went to the Romanshorn Zoo in Switzerland . In 1973 an Indochinese Tiger (
Panthera tigris corbetti ) named Poona, who was born at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle in
1962, was sent to Washington from the Brookfield Zoo and bred to Mohini [36] and Kesari. [37]
(Poona would have been regarded as a Bengal tiger for the first two years of his life because the
Indo-Chinese subspecies was not recognized until 1968.) Mohini did not conceive. Kesari
produced six orange cubs, an extraordinary number, especially for a first litter, but only
one survived, a female named Marvina. Kesari handed Marvina over to her keepers and kept the
other five. Marvina was mistaken for male, and named Marvin which was changed to Marvina when
it was discovered that he was a she. Washington Zoo keeper Art Cooper, who hand reared Marvina,
observed that white tigers were the most obstinate cats in the zoo, and said that Marvina had a
typical white tiger personality. [38] (Poona also fathered litters by two other tigresses in
Brookfield.) In 1974 Marvina, Ramana, and Kesari were sent to the Cincinnati Zoo and
Botanical Garden , and Rewati and Mohini went to the Brookfield Zoo, to be boarded during
renovations in Washington, until 1976. On June 20 , 1974 while at the Cincinnati Zoo Ramana and
Kesari produced a litter of three white and one orange cub, including a white male named
Ranjit, two white females named Bharat and Priya, and an orange male named Peela. Devra
Kleiman of the National Zoo said that she was well aware of the white gene and specifically told
Cincinnati not to breed from any of these tigers-Ramana, Kesari, or Marvina. Cincinnati
countered that although Ramana and Kesari had failed to breed in Washington they did so almost
as soon as they arrived in Cincinnati. [39]

As a fringe benefit of inbreeding the four cubs were pure-Bengal tigers, and they were the last
registered Bengal tigers born in the United States. Ranjit, Bharat, Priya, Peela, and Rewati
had inbreeding coefficients of 0.406. [40] Ramana died in 1974 of a kidney infection and
became a father for the last time posthumously. A white half sister of Mohini's bred from Mohan
and his white daughter Sukishi born on March 26, 1966, named Gomti [7] and later renamed
Princess, lived in the Crandon Park Zoo in Miami for about a year before she died of a viral
infection. She arrived in Miami on January 13 , 1968 . She was so inbred that both her mother and
grandmother were also her half sisters, and her father, Mohan, was also her grandfather and
great grandfather. She was half sister and niece to Mohini. Mohan had fathered three
generations of his family.

Miami mayor Chuck Hall met the 22-month-old 350 lbs. white tigress at the airport and rode with
her to the zoo. He wanted to call her Maya, the name suggested by the Maharaja, which translates
as Princess. Ralph S. Scott, who paid $35,000 for her and gave her to the Zoological Society of
Florida, preferred the name Princess. [41] [42] It was Ralph S. Scott, a famous big game
hunter, who suggested to John W. Kluge that he buy a white tiger for the children of America. He
had seen the white tigers in Govindgarh Palace while tiger hunting in India. [10] The
government of India wanted Princess to be the last white tiger exported from the country. A
male white tiger, named Ravi, acquired by Ralph S. Scott for the Crandon Park Zoo died at Kanpur
railway station en route from India in 1967. He was a son of Raja and Rani, making him Princess's
triple first cousin, born in New Delhi, and sold by the Maharaja of Rewa. Mohini died in 1979.
[43] The skins and skulls of Mohini and Moni are in the Smithsonian , but are not on display.

An orange brother of Mohini's named Ramesh lived in the MÃ©nagerie du Jardin des Plantes
(Paris Zoo), and was bred to an unrelated tigress, but none of the offspring survived to
reproduce. Ramesh was born in Govindgarh Palace and had an orange female littermate, named
Ratna who went to New Delhi Zoo, had a white male littermate named Ramu. [7] They were the fourth
and last litter of Mohan and Radha. Ratna was paired with a wild caught male named Jim, at New
Delhi Zoo, and produced three litters. Each cub would have had a 50% chance of inheriting the
white gene from Ratna. Jim was captured in the Rewa forest, so they thought there was a chance he
carried white genes. He had been somebody's pet, but after he ate a cat he was given to New Delhi
Zoo. Jim used to appear leaping into his pond, at New Delhi Zoo, in the opening of one of Gerald
Durrell 's TV shows. E.P. Gee mentioned, in his book "The Wildlife Of India", that Bristol Zoo
wanted to acquire one of the cubs of Mohan and Begum, as a mate for one of its white tigers,
Champak or Chameli, to lessen the degree of inbreeding, as the US National Zoo had done through
the acquisition of Sampson. In 1987 Ranjit, Bharat, Priya, and Peela were sold to the
International Animal Exchange. Ranjit, Priya, and Peela went to the IAE's facility in Grand
Prairie, Texas . The phenomenon of spontaneous ovulation in a tiger was first observed by
Devra Kleiman, in one of the white tigresses at the National Zoo, which meant that it was
possible to breed tigers by artificial insemination .



[ edit ] Tony



Tony , born in July of 1972 in the Circus Winter Quarters of the Cole Bros. Circus (the Terrell
Jacobs farm) in Peru, Indiana , was the founder of many American white tiger lines, especially
those used in circuses. [44] His grandfather was a registered Siberian tiger, named Kubla,
who was born at the Como Park, Zoo, and Conservatory in Saint Paul, Minnesota . [45] [46]
Kubla's parents were born in the wild and believed to be brother and sister. He was bred to a
Bengal tigress named Susie, from a west coast zoo, at the Great Plains Zoo in Sioux Falls in
South Dakota . Susie was once owned by Clyde Beatty . Two of their cubs (Rajah and Sheba II) were
bred together in a brother–sister mating, by Baron Julius Von Uhl, who lived in Peru,
Indiana. Julius Von Uhl was born in Budapest and came to America in 1956 from Hungary after the
revolution. One of the results of his tiger breeding was Tony, who therefore carried mixed
blood [47] and was responsible for introducing Siberian genes into previously pure Bengal
line of white tigers in North America . He may also be the source of a gene for stripelessness.
Tigers of mixed or unknown ancestry are called generics, or even "trash tigers", by zoo
people. 97% of tiger genomes are in private hands. [48] Kubla was also bred to an Amur tigress
named Katrina, who was born at the Rotterdam Zoo, and passed through the hands of two American
zoos before joining Kubla and Susie at the Great Plains Zoo (see International Tiger
Studbook). Kubla and Katrina have living pure-Amur descendants which may include a line of
white tigers, that are claimed as pure-Amurs, which originated out of Center Hill, Florida .
These white tigers are not registered Amur tigers. A tiger trainer named Alan Gold owned a pair
of Amur tigers which once produced a stillborn white cub.

In 1972 there were four white tigers in the United States: Mohini and her daughter Rewati in
Washington D.C., Tony, and his first cousin named Bagheera ,a female born on July 8, 1972 in a
litter of two white cubs, including a male which didn't survive, in the Hawthorn Circus of John
F. Cuneo Jr. Bagheera's mother, Sheba III, was a sister of Tony's mother, Sheba II. Bagheera's
father was either her registered Amur uncle and preferred mate, named Ural, or one of two of her
brothers, named Prince and Saber, who were also brothers to Tony's parents. [49] Sheba III
lived to be 26, an astonishing age for a tiger. (This may be the tiger world record for
longevity. 20 is extremely old for a tiger.)

Most of Sheba III's litters did not include white cubs, but at least 50% of her orange cubs would
have been white gene carriers, since they could have inherited the gene from their mother, and
if both parents were heterozygotes 66%, or two out of three, of their orange cubs are likely to
have been carriers. Prince was castrated before Sheba III conceived another white cub, a male
named Frosty, born on Feb. 25, 1975, in a litter which included two orange females and one
orange male. [49] Frosty severely mauled trainer Wade Burck. [50] It seems odd that a tiger
which may have been fathering such valuable cubs (Prince) would have been neutered. Saber was
never observed trying to mate, so perhaps Ural, also called Genghis, did sire one or more of
Sheba III's white cubs, which would have been three quarters Siberian had this been the case.
It is possible for tigers from the same litter to have different fathers. It's also possible
that any or all three tigers-Ural, Prince, and Saber, carried the white gene.

Tony was purchased by John F. Cuneo Jr., owner of the Hawthorn Circus Corp. of Grayslake,
Illinois [51] [52] , in February 1975 for $20,000 in Detroit. Tony's parents, Raja and Sheba,
produced two more white cubs at the Baltimore County Fair on June 27 , 1976 . [53] The cubs were a
white male, named "Baltimore County Fair", a white female named "Snowball", and an orange
male. [54] Snowball's name was later changed to "Maharani", and all three cubs were sold to the
Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus in Washington D.C. . Maharani died in 1984. Baron Julius
Von Uhl had another three white cubs born between June 18 and 19, 1977 at Kingdom's 3 (formerly
Lion Country Safari ) at Stockbridge , Georgia off I-75 south of Atlanta . [55] Two lived only a
short time. The other, named Scarlett O'Hara, died at the Atlanta Zoo on Jan. 30, 1978 of
cardiac arrest while undergoing surgery to correct crossed eyes. She was still owned by
Julius Von Uhl at the time. [56] [57] Tony was sent on breeding loan to the Cincinnati Zoo in
1976, to be bred to Rewati from the US National Zoo. However, Tony and Rewati did not breed, so he
was bred to Mohini's orange daughter Kesari instead, resulting in a litter of four white and
one orange cub June 27 , 1976 , the same day that eight year old Sheba had her white cubs in
Baltimore, Maryland . It is an astounding coincidence that both tigresses gave birth to white
cubs on the exact same day. On that one day America's white tiger population nearly doubled
from 8 to 14. Kesari's 1976 litter represented a mixture of the two unrelated strains.

All of the white cubs from Kesari's 1976 litter by Tony were cross-eyed, as were Rewati and
Bagheera. The Cincinnati Zoo retained a brother and sister pair from the litter, named Bhim
and Sumita, and their orange sister Kamala. Two white males returned to the Hawthorn Circus
with Tony as John Cuneo's share from the breeding loan. John Cuneo also asked the Bristol Zoo to
trade some white tigers, to diversify the gene pool, but the Bristol Zoo declined, perhaps not
wishing to exchange pure-Bengals for mongrels. Tony, Bagheera, and Frosty lived for years
with a troop of Hawthorn Circus tigers stationed at Marineland and Game Farm , in Niagara
Falls, Ontario , Canada . Because of selective breeding only a few of the oldest white tigers in
the Hawthorn Circus today are cross eyed . Bhim and Sumita became the world record parents of
white cubs. In 1976 there were 39 white tigers-7 in New Delhi, 7 in Kolkata, one in Guwahati , one
in Lucknow , one in Hyderabad , 8 in Bristol , Cincinnati Zoo had 2, Washington had 5, John Cuneo
had 5, and Julius Von Uhl had 2. The Maharaja of Rewa retired from the white tiger business in
1976. He later abdicated in favor of his son so that he could run for the family seat in
parliament and became an MP. There is a white tiger cub on the shield of the coat of arms of the
Maharajas of Rewa.

Over 70 white tigers have been born at the Cincinnati Zoo, which is no longer in the white tiger
business. The Cincinnati Zoo sold white tigers [58] for $60,000 each. Siegfried & Roy bought a
litter of three white cubs from the Cincinnati Zoo, which were offspring of Bhim and Sumita,
for around $125,000. Prior to 1974 the Cincinnati Zoo wanted to acquire a white tiger, but no
zoo would sell at any price. By the 1980s the Cincinnati Zoo was the world's leading purveyor of
white tigers. After 1976 at least one more white tiger born at the Cincinnati Zoo was cross
eyed, a cub from Bhim and Sumita's first litter. Crossed eyes may be reduced or eliminated
through selective breeding , as it has been in Siamese cats . Critics refer to white tiger
breeding as "proliferation", and the Cincinnati Zoo was derided as a "white tiger mill".

The Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska bought Tony's parents and orange sister Obie (born in
1975) in 1978 [59] , and bred more white tigers. Kesari also went to live at Omaha Zoo, but didn't
have any more cubs. Some of Tony's white siblings born in Omaha proved to be sterile. Obie was
paired with Ranjit from the National Zoo, and their cubs like those of Tony and Kesari,
included non inbred white tigers. A white tiger named Chester, who was a son of Ranjit and Obie,
born at the Omaha Zoo, fathered the first test tube tigers [60] , and then became the first white
tiger in Australia when he was sent to the Taronga Zoo in Sydney . His brother, Panghur Ban, was
the National Zoo's last white tiger. [61] A white tiger named Rajiv, a son of Bhim, became the
first white tiger in Africa , when he was sent to Pretoria Zoo in exchange for a king cheetah .
[62]

In 1983 Rewati was paired with Ika, from Kesari's 1976 litter, at the Columbus Zoo [63] . By this
time he was a three legged amputee retired from circus performance, put out to pasture to
breed. Ika killed Rewati in the act of mating [64] . Ika was then mated with a white tigress named
Taj, who was a grand daughter of his brothers Ranjit and Bhim, and fathered white cubs in
Columbus. Ika and Taj had a cross eyed daughter named Lilly, who appeared on Late Night with
David Letterman with Jack Hanna in 1986, as her mother Taj had done years earlier. Ika was also
bred to Taj's orange mother Dolly, a daughter of Bhim and an unrelated orange tigress named
Kimanthi, in Columbus. Taj's father, Duke, was a son of Ranjit from an outcross to an unrelated
orange tigress. Isson, a white grandson of Kesari, was also dispatched to Columbus on
breeding loan from the Hawthorn Circus, of Grayslake, Illinois, which eventually had 80
white tigers. In 1984 five white tiger cubs were stolen from the Hawthorn Circus in Portland,
Oregon, and two died. The tigers were touring with the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus .
The culprit was a veterinarian who was sentenced to one year in prison and six months in a
halfway house. [65]

In 1974 a white cub was born in the Racine Zoological Gardens in Wisconsin , from a
father-daughter mating. The father, named Bucky, killed the white cub. The mother, named
Bonnie, was later bred with an orange littermate of Tony named "Chequila", who belonged to
James Witchey of Ravenna, Ohio , who bought him from Dick Hartman of South Lebanon, Ohio , when
he was four or five years of age. Chequila proved to be a white gene carrier and fathered at least
one white cub in the Racine Zoo in 1980. It is not known whether Bucky, who came from the Fort
Wayne Children's Zoo in Indiana , and his daughter Bonnie, were related to any of the
established strains of white tigers. By 1987 10% of North American zoo tigers were white.

In 2007 a white tiger was born at Safari Game Park in Bandon, Oregon . The tiger, Sultan, is, as of
October 2007, publicly exhibited where children and adults can play with it and hold it and the
mother is also at the game park.



[ edit ] Orissa White Tigers



Three white tigers were also born in the Nandan Kanan Zoo ( Nandankanan Zoo ) in Bhubaneswar ,
Orissa , India in 1980. Their parents were an orange father–daughter pair called Deepak and
Ganga, who were not related to Mohan or any other captive white tiger – one of their
wild-caught ancestors would have carried the recessive white gene, and it showed up when
Deepak was mated to his daughter. Deepak's sister also turned out to be a white gene carrier.
These white tigers are therefore referred to as the Orissa strain, as opposed to the Rewa
strain, of white tigers founded by Mohan [66] .

When the surprise birth of three white cubs occurred there was a white tigress already living
at the zoo, named Diana, from New Delhi Zoo. One of the three was later bred to her creating
another blend of two unrelated strains of white tigers. This lineage resulted in several
white tigers in Nandan Kanan Zoo. Today the Nandankanan Zoo has the largest collection of
white tigers in India. The Cincinnati Zoo acquired two female white tigers from the Nandan
Kanan Zoo, in the hopes of establishing a line of pure-Bengal white tigers in America, but they
never got a male, and didn't receive authorization from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums
(AZA)'s Species Survival Plan (SSP) to breed them. White tigers are freaks and phenotypic
aberrations. [67] The AZA has recommended that white tigers be "bred to extinction", which is
to say, not bred at all and allowed to die out, because they consume space and resources needed
for endangered orange tigers. [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] It has been suggested that as few as
1 in 10,000 tigers in the wild was white. Although many AZA member zoos still keep them, as an
attraction to generate revenue, almost none breed them. Sarah Christie, the coordinator of
Conservation Programmes at London Zoo, has said that she would not be adverse to using a white
tiger in a zoo breeding program provided it was purebred. She said that it's a naturally
occurring gene and it shouldn't be selected for or against. [74] Zoo breeding programs for
tigers may be of doubtful value to conservation in any case. K.S. Sankhala once asked Sally
Walker of the Zoo Outreach Organisation , of Tamil Nadu , India, "Why do foreigners hate our
white tigers so much?" The Zoo Outreach Organisation used to publish studbooks for white
tigers, which were compiled by A.K. Roychoudhury of the Bose Institute in Calcutta, and
subsidized by the Humane Society of India. The Columbus Zoo had also hoped to breed
pure-Bengal white tigers, but were unable to obtain a white registered Bengal mate for Rewati
from India. [75]

There were also surprise births of white tigers in the Asian Circus, in India, to parents not
known to have been white gene carriers, or heterozygotes, and not known to have any
relationship to any other white tiger strains. There was a white cub born at Mysore Zoo from
orange parents descended from Deepak's sister. On August 29 , 1979 a white tigress named Seema
was dispatched to Kanpur Zoo to be bred to Badal, a tiger who was a fourth generation descendant
of Mohan and Begum. The pair did not breed so it was decided to pair Seema with one of two wild
caught, notorious man eaters, either Sheru or Titu, from the Jim Corbett National Park . Seema
and Sheru produced a white cub, and for a while it was thought there might be white genes in
Corbett's population of tigers, but the cub didn't stay white. [76] [77] [78]

There have been other cases of white tiger, white lion , and white panther cubs being born, and
then changing to normal color. White tigers which were a mixture of the Rewa and Orissa
strains, born at the Nandan Kanan Zoo, were non inbred. A white tiger from out of the Orissa
strain found it's way to the Western Plains Zoo in Australia . Australia's Dreamworld , on the
Gold Coast , wanted to breed this tiger to one of their white tigers from the United States,
acquired from Croatian -American tiger trainer Josip Marcan, who was a trainer with the
Hawthorn Circus and the Clyde Beatty Cole Bros. Circus, and had also worked as a veterinarian
at the Frankfurt Zoo. The Western Plains Zoo rejected the idea.



[ edit ] Stripeless (Snow White) Tigers

nearly stripeless tiger is on display at The Mirage in Las Vegas, Nevada

An additional genetic condition can remove most of the striping of a white tiger, making the
animal almost pure white. One such specimen was exhibited at Exeter Change in England in 1820
and described by Georges Cuvier as " A white variety of Tiger is sometimes seen, with the
stripes very opaque, and not to be observed except in certain angles of light. " [79] .
Naturalist Richard Lydekker said that, " a white tiger, in which the fur was of a creamy tint,
with the usual stripes faintly visible in certain parts, was exhibited at the old menagerie at
Exeter Change about the year 1820 ." [80] Hamilton Smith said, " A wholly white tiger, with the
stripe-pattern visible only under reflected light, like the pattern of a white tabby cat, was
exhibited in the Exeter Change Menagerie in 1820. ", and John George Wood stated that, " a
creamy white, with the ordinary tigerine stripes so faintly marked that they were only
visible in certain lights. " Edwin Henry Landseer also drew this tigress in 1824.

The modern strain of snow white tigers came from repeated brother–sister matings of Bhim
and Sumita at Cincinnati zoo. The gene involved possibly came from the Siberian tiger, via
their part-Siberian ancestor Tony. Continued inbreeding appears to have caused a recessive
gene for stripelessness to show up. About one fourth of Bhim and Sumita's offspring were
stripeless. Their striped white offspring, which have been sold to zoos around the world, may
also carry the stripeless gene.

Because Tony is present in many white tiger pedigrees, the gene may also be present in other
captive white tigers. As a result, stripeless whites have occurred in zoos as far afield as the
Czech Republic , Spain and Mexico . Stage magicians Siegfried & Roy were the first to attempt to
breed selectively for stripelessness; they own snow white Bengal tigers taken from
Cincinnati Zoo ( Tsumura , Mantra , Mirage and Akbar-Kabul ) and Guadalajara , Mexico ( Vishnu
and Jahan ), and a stripeless Siberian tiger called Apollo . [81]

In 2004, a blue-eyed, stripeless white tiger was born at a wildlife refuge in Alicante , Spain .
Its parents are normal orange Bengals. The cub was named Artico ("Arctic"). Stripeless white
tigers were thought to be sterile until Siegfried & Roy's stripeless white tigress Sitarra, a
daughter of Bhim and Sumita, gave birth. Another variation which came out of the white strains
are unusually light orange tigers called golden tabby tigers. These may be orange tigers
which carry the stripeless white gene as a recessive. Some white tigers in India have been very
dark nearly reverting to the orange colour

Contrary to popular belief, white tigers are not albinos ; true albino tigers would have no
stripes. The stripeless white tigers known today only have very pale stripes.

Part of the confusion is due to the misidentification of the so-called chinchilla gene (for
white) as an allele of the albino series (publications prior to the 1980s refer to it as an
albino gene). The mutation is recessive to normal color, which means that two orange tigers
carrying the mutant gene may produce white offspring, and white tigers bred together will
produce only white cubs. The stripe color varies due to the influence and interaction of other
genes.

While the inhibitor ("chinchilla") gene affects the color of the hair shaft, there is a
separate "wide-band" gene affecting the distance between the dark bands of colour on agouti
hairs. [82] An orange tiger who inherits two copies of this wide-band gene becomes a golden
tabby ; a white who inherits two copies becomes almost or completely stripeless. Inbreeding
allows the effect of recessive genes to show up, hence the ground and stripe colour variations
among white tigers.

As early as 1907, naturalist Richard Lydeker doubted the existence of albino tigers. [83]
However, we do have a report of true albinism: in 1922, two pink-eyed albino young were shot
along with their mother at Mica Camp, Tisri , in the Cooch Behar district , according to Victor N
Narayan in a ”Miscellaneous Note” in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society .
The albinos were described as sickly-looking sub-adults, with extended necks and pink eyes.

Outside of India white tigers have been prone to crossed eyes, a condition known as
strabismus, like "Clarence the cross eyed lion", [84] due to incorrectly routed visual
pathways in the brain in white tigers. When stressed or confused all white tigers cross their
eyes, according to tiger trainer Andy Goldfarb. Strabismus is associated with white tigers
of mixed Bengal/Siberian ancestry. The only pure-Bengal white tiger reported to be cross
eyed was Mohini's daughter Rewati. Strabismus is directly linked to the white gene and is not a
separate consequence of inbreeding. [85] [86] [87] The orange littermates of white tigers
are not prone to strabismus. Siamese cats and albinos of every species which has been studied
all exhibit the same visual pathway abnormality found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also
sometimes cross eyed, as are some albino ferrets . The visual pathway abnormality was first
documented in white tigers in the brain of Moni, after he died, although his eyes were in normal
alignment. There is a disruption in the optic chiasm . The examination of Moni's brain
suggested the disruption may less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of
the visual pathway abnormality, by which some of the optic nerves are routed to the wrong side
of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things,
until they learn to compensate. Some compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass
from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma some cross and some do not, so that
visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers can't see as
well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia like albinos. [88] There is a 450 lbs. male
cross-eyed white tiger, named Namaste, at the Pana'ewa Rainforest Zoo in Hawaii , which was
donated to the zoo by Las Vegas magician Dirk Arthur . [89]

White tigers, Siamese cats, and Himalayan rabbits have enzymes in their fur which react to
temperature causing them to grow darker in cold. [90] They produce a mutated form of
tyrosinase , an enzyme used in the production of melanin , which only functions at certain
temperatures. This is why Siamese cats and Himalayan rabbits are darker on their faces, ears,
legs, and tails, where the cold penetrates more easily. K.S. Sankhala, who was director of the
New Delhi Zoo in the 1960s, observed that white tigers were always whiter in Rewa, even when
they were born in New Delhi and returned there. "In spite of living in a dusty courtyard they
were always snow white." [2] A weakened immune system is directly linked to reduced
pigmentation in white tigers. White tigers react strangely to anesthesia [91] due to their
inability to produce normal tyrosinase, a trait shared with albinos, according to zoo
veterinarian David Taylor . He was treating a pair of white tigers from the Cincinnati Zoo at
Fritz Wurm's safari park in Stukenbrock, Germany, for salmonella . [92]

Mohini was checked for ChÃ©diak-Higashi syndrome in 1960, but the results were
inconclusive. [93] [94] This condition is similar to albino mutations and causes bluish
lightening of the fur color, crossed eyes, and prolonged bleeding after surgery or in the
event of injury, the blood is slow to coagulate, in domestic cats. There has never been a case of
a white tiger having ChÃ©diak-Higashi syndrome. There has been a single case of a white
tiger having central retinal degeneration , which could be related to reduced pigmentation
in the eye, reported from the Milwaukee County Zoo. [95] [96] The white tiger was a male on loan
from the Cincinnati Zoo.



[ edit ] Inbreeding depression

tiger at the ZooParc de Beauval in France



(talk) Because of the extreme rarity of the white tiger allele in the wild [2] , the breeding
pool was limited to the small number of white tigers in captivity. According to Kailash
Sankhala the last white tiger ever seen in the wild was shot in 1958. Inbreeding between these
tigers often leads to defects [97] . Due to the high market value for white tigers,
unscrupulous breeders will still inbreed white tigers to ensure the offspring also exhibit
the recessive gene. Some animal rights activists have called for a halt to the breeding of
white tigers altogether. Rewati had a crooked spine, shortened limbs, and crossed eyes, and
her reproductive cycle was irregular, making her a poor candidate for breeding. This may be
why the National Zoo did not elect to breed her with Poona, while he was on breeding loan to
Washington in 1973. It is probably due to the rarity and demand for white tigers that Rewati was
later bred by Robert Baudy, in Center Hill, Florida, to an unrelated orange Amur tiger, but did
not conceive. A white Amur tiger may have been born at Center Hill, and given rise to a strain of
white Amur tigers. The white tiger pictured on the right is at the ZooParc de Beauval in France,
and came from Center Hill. Robert Baudy realized that his tigers had white genes when a tiger he
sold to Marwell Zoo in England developed white spots, and bred them accordingly. He sold a
white tiger to Mike Tyson . Rewati also lived at the Bronx Zoo for several years and they may have
attempted to breed her. She appeared on the covers of the April 1970 National Geographic and
the June 22, 1973 issue of Science.

It has been possible to expand the white gene pool by outcrossing white tigers with unrelated
orange tigers and then using the cubs to produce more white tigers. Ranjit, Bharat, Priya, and
Bhim were all outcrossed; in some instances to more than one tiger. Bharat was bred to an
unrelated orange tiger named Jack, from San Francisco Zoo, and had an orange daughter named
Kanchana. [98] Bharat and Priya were also bred with an unrelated orange tiger from Knoxville
Zoo , and Ranjit was bred to this tiger's sister, also from Knoxville Zoo. Bhim fathered
several litters by an unrelated orange tigress named Kimanthi, at the Cincinnati Zoo. Ranjit
had several mates at the Omaha Zoo. [99] The last descendants of Bristol Zoo's white tigers
were a group of orange tigers from outcrosses, which were bought by a Pakistani senator and
shipped to Pakistan. Rajiv, Pretoria Zoo's white tiger, who was born in the Cincinnati Zoo and
became the first white tiger in Africa when he was traded for a king cheetah, was also
outcrossed and sired at least two litters of orange cubs at Pretoria Zoo. Outcrossing isn't
necessarily done with the intent of producing more white cubs by resuming inbreeding further
down the line. The National Zoo no longer keeps any Bengal tigers and has shifted its focus to
endangered Sumatran tigers. The Cincinnati Zoo has more recently bred endangered
Indochinese Tigers. The drawbacks of outcrossing are the loss of a generation and the
production of surplus cubs which may become "castoffs" or "throw-aways", and be discarded
after they have been used to propagate the next generation of white tigers. [100]

Today white tigers are so numerous that many are in sanctuaries for unwanted tigers. The
Lowery Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida has four white tigers from Center Hill , which are "rescue
tigers", and may also be pure-Amur tigers. White tigers and white lions have been used in
canned hunts in South Africa [101] , and there are white tigers being bred on Asian tiger farms,
to be killed for their body parts. In China white tigers are made into wine. [102] The PanYu
XiangJiang Safari Park in Gungzhou, China , started with four white tigers from Sweden and
Germany in 1996, the first in China. Today they have over 100 white tigers, with 10 to 20 births a
year, and claim to have 50% of the world's white tigers, but it's unclear, given the cost of
housing and feeding so many, why any one safari park or zoo would need more than 1 or 2. A single
white tigress imported from Sweden has given birth to 49 of the white tigers. [103] [104] [105]
A tigress should not be bred more than once every 2 to 3 years and this one has been producing two
litters a year. There is a myth which has been propagated on the internet, one of many
concerining white tigers, that they have an 80% infant mortality. The infant mortality rate
for white tigers is no higher than it is for normal orange tigers. In recent years a white
tigress at the Buenos Aires Zoo has produced several litters of white cubs, including some
which are stripeless, and a litter of 6 in 2004. [106] [107] A stripeless white tigress gave
birth to four stripeless white, and one orange cub, at the zoo in Guadalajara , Mexico , which
has an association with Siegfried & Roy, in 2007. The fact that the litter included one orange
cub shows that the father, Nino, is orange. This was the sixth litter born at the zoo. [108]
[109] In the United States white tigers are in the hands of many shady profit-motivated
private owners and breeders, and white tigers have been sold to drug lords and as pets. In 1998 a
Florida woman was killed by her pet white tiger and she was its second victim. [110] In 2005 the
Border Patrol seized two white tiger cubs which were in a pick up truck on the Texas-Mexican
border. [111] Another white tiger cub was confiscated on the border between Tijuana and San
Diego in 1991 and donated to the San Diego Zoo, a female named Blanca. [112] Siegfried and Roy,
and Tiger Island at MarineWorld/AfricaUSA in Vallejo, California , each asked to have the
valuable cub which came from a private breeder in Arkansas . White tigers have been relegated
from royal palace to roadside zoo in 56 years. The white tiger pictured at right at the Miami Zoo
was born in the Hawthorn Circus and is a subspecific hybrid ( Panthera tigris tigris x altaica
). In Miami Zoo the white tiger lives in a facsimile of the temple ruins of Angkor Wat in
Kampuchea . A keeper was killed by a white tiger, which was a cub of Bhim and Sumita born in
Cincinnati, in Miami Zoo in 1994. [113] [114] A white tiger also killed a keeper in a Texas zoo.

Perhaps the mongrelization of white tigers has been a mixed blessing, since although the
introduction of Amur genes into the white strain has further delegitimized white tigers for
zoo conservation purposes, it's possible that hybrid vigor has counteracted inbreeding
depression and created healthier bloodlines. Outcrossing is a way of bringing fresh blood
into the white strain. The new Delhi Zoo loaned out white tigers to various zoos in India for
outcrossing, and the government had to impose a whip to force zoos to return either the white
tigers or their orange offspring.

Siegfried & Roy did at least one outcross. [115] In the mid 1980s they offered to collaborate
with the Indian government in the creation of a healthier strain of white tigers. The Indian
government was reportedly studying the offer, but may not have wished to have their white
tigers mongrelized like those in America. In India there was a moratorium on breeding white
tigers after cubs were born at New Delhi Zoo with arched backs and clubbed feet necessitating
euthanasia. At one point the Cincinnati Zoo was the only zoo in the world breeding them. [116]
The New Delhi Zoo decided to try again reasoning that if Cleopatra could be born healthy and
normal as the product of three generations of brother to sister unions then so might white
tigers. (Cleopatra's parents were not brother and sister.) Mice have been bred brother to
sister for 150 generations without ill effect, and are therefore 99.999% genetically
identical. Hybrid white tigers appear to be healthier than white subspecific purebreds and
an analogy can be made with purebred vs. mongrel dogs. [117] India is committed to keeping
their white tigers purebred.

In the mid 1980s Siegfried & Roy owned 10% of the world's white tigers. In the 1980s Siegfried &
Roy were escorting two big, dark striped, white tiger cubs to their new home at Phantasialand ,
in Bruhl , Germany , when the white tigers and their truck were briefly stolen in New York City ,
when the driver stopped for coffee. The white tigers made their debut in Germany at a ceremony
attended by the United States Ambassador. Siegfried & Roy have bred white tigers in
collaboration with the Nashville Zoo and they appeared on Larry king with white tiger cubs
born at the Nashville Zoo.. Fritz Wurm's safari park in Germany bought a pair of white tigers
from the Cincinnati Zoo, and Joan Collins attended the opening of the golden domed white tiger
pavilion, at the safari park in Stukenbrock, Germany. Other genetic problems include
shortened tendons of the forelegs, club foot , kidney problems, arched or crooked backbone
and twisted neck. Reduced fertility and miscarriages, noted by ”tiger man” Kailash
Sankhala , in pure-Bengal white tigers, were attributed to inbreeding depression . [2] There
have also been congenital cataracts reported from the Cincinnati Zoo [118] and Parkinson's
disease in India. [119] [120] A condition known as "star-gazing", which is associated with
inbreeding in big cats, has also been reported in white tigers. [121] Some of the white tigers
born to North American lines have bulldog faces with a snub nose, jutting jaw, domed head and
wide-set eyes with an indentation between the eyes. However, some of these traits have also
been linked to poor diet. The white gene is recessive, and therefore must be inherited from
both parents, to produce a white tiger. Inbreeding is a conscious strategy to promote
homozygosity in white tigers. There's really no such thing as a white gene. Rather white
tigers carry orange genes which are latent, switched off or suppressed by an inhibitor, which
is the chinchilla gene.

tiger sleeping at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans , Louisiana .

In Rewa hunters' diaries recorded 9 white tigers in the fifty years prior to 1960. The Journal
of The Bombay Natural History Society reported 17 white tigers shot between 1907 and 1933.
E.P. Gee collected accounts of 35 white tigers from the wild up to 1959, with still more
uncounted from Assam where he had his tea plantation, although Assam with it's humid jungles
was considered a likelier haunt for black tigers. Some white tigers in the wild had reddish
stripes known as "red tigers". The Boga-bagh, or "white tiger", Tea Estate in upper Assam , was
named that after two white tigers were shot there in the early 1900s. While the modern
population descends from Rewan tigers, white tigers may have been recorded as far afield as
China and Korea [122] , Nepal , Burma , the Malay Peninsula , Sumatra and Java . Historically,
white tigers may have been reported in northern China, in the geographic range of the Siberian
tiger, and perhaps in the Indochinese, Sumatran and Javan subspecies, but not among South
China , Caspian (Panthera tigris virgata) or Bali Tigers . Korean and Manchurian tigers were
previously recognized as separate subspecies (Panthera tigris coreensis and Panthera
tigris longipilis or amurensis) [123] [124] , but they are now regarded part of the Amur tiger
subspecies (Siberian) named for the Amur river . There were also blue tigers reported from
southern China, referred to as "blue devils" because they were notorious man-eaters. Arthur
Locke writing in "The Tigers Of Trengganu " (1954) mentions white tigers, but it's unclear
whether he means specifically in Trengganu , in the Malay Peninsula , or elsewhere in Asia, in
which case there may be no record of white tigers ever existing in the Malay Peninsula. [125]
The Malayan Tiger ( Panthera tigris malayensis or Panthera tigris jacksoni ) was only
recognized as a subspecies separate from the Indochinese ( Panthera tigris corbetti ) in
2004, and the Indochinese as a subspecies separate from the Bengal in 1968. White tigers were
reported from Burma, now called Myanmar, but since the Irrawaddy River (Ayeyarwady since
1998) is the theoretical dividing line between the range of the Bengal and Indochinese tiger ,
it is uncertain whether there were also white Indochinese tigers or white Malayan tigers .

In some regions, the animal forms part of local tradition. In China, it was revered as the god of
the West, Baihu . In South Korea , a white tiger will sometimes be represented on the taegeuk
emblem on the flag – the symbolising evil, opposite the green dragon for good. In Indian
superstition, the white tiger was the incarnation of a Hindu deity, and anyone who killed it
would die within a year. Sumatran and Javan royalty claimed descent from white tigers, and the
animals were regarded as the reincarnations of royalty. In Java the white tiger was
associated with the vanished Hindu kingdoms and with ghosts and spirits. It was also the icon
guardian of the seventeenth century court.

White tigers with dark stripes were recorded in the wild in India during the Mughal Empire
(1556–1605). A painting from 1590 of Akbar while hunting near Gwalior depicts four tigers,
two of which appear white. As many as 17 instances of white tigers were recorded in India
between 1907 and 1933 in several separate locations: Orissa, Bilaspur , Sohagpur and Rewa .

Between 1892 and 1922, white tigers were routinely shot in India in places such as Orissa,
Upper Assam , Bilaspur, Cooch Behar and Pune . Pollock (1900) reported white tigers from Burma
and the Jynteah hills of Meghalaya . In the 1920s and 30s, fifteen white tigers were killed in
Bihar , and more were shot in other regions. [126] On 22 January 1939 , the Prime Minister of
Nepal shot a white tiger at Barda camp in Terai , Nepal. The last observed wild white tiger was
shot in 1958, and the mutation is considered extinct in the wild [2] . There have been rumors of
white tigers in the wild in India since then, but none have been considered credible. It has
been suggested from the casual way that Jim Corbett makes reference to a white tigress, which
he filmed with two orange cubs, in his "Man-eaters of Kumoan" (1946) [127] that white tigers
were nothing out of the ordinary to him. Corbett's black and white film footage is probably the
only film in existence of a white tiger in the wild. It illustrates again that white tigers
survived and reproduced in the wild. The film was used in a National Geographic docu-drama
about Corbett's life. One theory of white tigers holds that they were symptomatic of
inbreeding as a consequence of over hunting and habitat loss, as tiger populations became
isolated. In 1965 there was a chair upholstered with a white tiger skin in the "India
collection" of Marjorie Merriweather Post , at her Hillwood estate in Washington D.C. , which
is now operated as a museum. A color photograph of this item appeared in the Nov. 5, 1965 issue of
Life magazine. [128] In the October 1975 issue of National Geographic there is a photograh of
the minister of defense for the United Arab Emirates with a stuffed white tiger in his office.
[129] The actor Cesar Romero owned a white tiger skin. 0 comments
