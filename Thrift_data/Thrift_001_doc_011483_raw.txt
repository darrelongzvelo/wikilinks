Image: http://www.onnit.com/onnit/images/alphabrain/product-info.jpg GPC CHOLINE
– 100mg GPC Choline is included to increase available amounts of acetylcholine in the body.
Glyceryl phosphoryl choline is heralded as the most effective form of choline for
acetylcholine production because it has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier easier
and more rapidly than other forms of choline such as lecithin or choline bitrartate .
Acetylcholine is a powerful neurotransmitter which is found both in the peripheral nervous
system and in the central nervous system . There is scientific evidence that proves that
increased levels of acetylcholine in the body can dramatically increase memory and
cognitive ability of men and women of all ages. A study performed by Sangiorgi Barbagallo at
the University of Palermo studied 2044 candidates who suffered from recent stroke or
transient ischemic attack . The study concluded that administration of GPC choline
confirmed its therapeutic role in improving cognitive ability in this group of study
subjects. In addition, scientific studies have shown that increased dietary intake of
choline can improve athletic performance. A study documented in the Journal of the
International Society of Sports Nutrition by Ralf Jager in July 2007 evaluated ten long
distance runners in a double blind, crossover, placebo -controlled clinical trial. The
runners either received 2.8 g of choline citrate or a placebo one hour prior to and after the
completion of 10 miles of a 20 mile run. The results of the study revealed that plasma choline
levels increased in the supplemented group and decreased in the placebo group. The average
run time of the supplemented group was 153.7 minutes, whereas, the placebo group’s run time
was diminished at 158.9 minutes. The results of this study are encouraging for the use of
choline supplements to enhance athletic performance. It should be noted that this dietary
supplement will not aid in athletic performances that require short periods of strength,
speed or accuracy. Huperzia Serrata – 50mg (.5% Huperzine A) Derived from Chinese club moss
, the active ingredient in this dietary supplement, Huperzine A , has been shown to act as an
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor . Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme found in the human body
that causes acetylcholine to break down into choline and an acetic acid . If
acetylcholinesterase is able to act uninhibited, the powerful neurotransmission
properties of acetylcholine will be neutralized. Huperzia Serrata has been used for
millenia in Chinese medicine , but recently there have been scientific studies that have
proven the presence of Huperzia Serrata has neuroprotective effects and enhances cognitive
function in animals and humans. A study perfomed by RW. Zhang at the Zhejiang Academy of
Medical Sciences in Hangzhou, China in 1991 evaluated the efficacy of Huperzine A in the
treatment of dementia . The study was a random, match, double blind study which focused on 56
patients with senile dementia or multi-infarct dementia and 104 patients with senile and
pre-senile memory disorders. The group with multi-infarct dementia was administered 0.05
mg of Huperzine A via intramuscular injection twice a day for four weeks, the memory disorder
group as administered 0.03 mg of Huperzine A via intramuscular injection twice a day for four
weeks, saline was administered to the control group. The results of the study revealed
Huperzine A to have significant anticholinesterase activity. It should be noted that
throughout the clinical trial process, no unexpected toxicity was reported in response to
administration of Huperzia Serrata and only a few patients exhibited slight dizziness which
did not affect the therapeutic effects of Huperzine A . It should also be noted that if you are
currently taking any medication that acts as a cholinesterase inhibitor , a physician should
be consulted prior to beginning consumption of Alpha Brain. Vinpocetine – 5mg Rounding out
the primary trio of cognitive enhancers is vinpocetine , a semi-synthetic extract derived
from a substance called vincamine which is a component of the common periwinkle plant , known
scientifically as vinca major . Vinpocetine has known vasodilatory effects which make this
chemical effective for treating inflammation and inhibiting hair loss. A twelve week
clinical trial examining the effects of oral vinpocetine was performed in Hungary in 2007.
This study was designed to show the efficacy of a twelve week regimen of vinpocetine on the
severity of mental deterioration on patients with ischemic stroke and mild cognitive
impairment . The patients were examined under resting conditions and in the presence of
chemical stimulus. Cerebral blood flow of patients was assessed using transcranial Doppler
in resting conditions and after thirty seconds of breath holding. Cognitive function was
assessed by the use of psychometric tests . The results of this clinical trial revealed that
patients who received oral vinpocetine had improved cerebrovascular reserve, improved
cognitive status and improved overall condition when compared to patients who did not
receive oral vinpocetine . AC-11 ® – 350mg Another crucial component of Alpha Brain® is
AC-11 ®, which is licensed under an agreement with Optigenix Inc . AC-11 ®. Formerly known as
C-Med-100 , AC-11 ® is a proprietary extract obtained from uncaria tomentosa which is native
to the South American rainforest . This substance has been used in South American medicine for
centuries for treatment of conditions such as inflammation , cancer and infection . Each pill
of Alpha Brain contains 350 mg of AC-11 ®. A human volunteer study performed in Sweden in 2001
confirmed the fact that AC-11 ® effectively reduced DNA damage and promoted leukocyte
recovery and DNA repair. In addition, the administration of AC-11 ® revealed no drug related
toxicity as measured by patient symptoms, serum blood chemistry, whole blood analysis and
leukocyte differential counts. In addition, another Swedish study performed by R.W.Pero at
the University of Lund revealed that 14 patients who were treated with AC-11 ® for four weeks
showed benefits of reduced pain, reduced fatigue , weight loss and decreased presence of DNA
damage. Bacopa -500mg Bacopa is an aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions
around the world. This plant has been used for centuries in India as a medicinal treatment in
Ayurveda , which is considered alternative medicine in the United States but accepted as
traditional medicine in India . A study performed by S. Goswami which was published in the
International Journal of Collaborative Research on Internal Medicine and Public Health
confirmed the efficacy of bacopa to increase cognitive function of individuals suffering
from Alzheimer’s disease . The study was an open label, non-randomized study. The study
consisted of 39 patients with an average age of 65.23 years who have been newly diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s disease . Each patient was administered 300 mg of Bacopa twice a day for 6
months. The results of this trial revealed the administration of Bacopa extracts yielded
improved cognitive function for geriatric patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease .
Pterostilbene – 250mg Pterostilbene is a compound known as a stilbenoid which is
chemically similar to the well known antioxidant resveratrol , found abundantly in
blueberries . Antioxidants are compounds that rid the body of free radicals , which
exacerbate cell damage and cause disease in the human body. There are well documented studies
of the antioxidant effects of resveratrol and its abilities to protect against many diseases
such as heart disease and many forms of cancer . Clinical studies have also proven that
pterostilbene offers similar antioxidant benefits and protective effects as reseveratrol
when administered in similar quantities. A study performed by AM Rimando at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture in 2002 evaluated the cancer chemoprotective and antioxidant
activities of pterostilbene . The results of the study revealed pterostilbene
significantly inhibited herbicide induced oxidative damage , showed moderate inhibition
of cyclooxygenase , an enzyme in the body responsible for production of prostaglandins .
Prostaglandins are lipid compounds derived from fatty acids which can induce pain and
swelling in the human body. Therefore, inhibition of cyclooxygenase can have therapeutic
effects for inflammation and swelling. In addition, this evaluation also revealed
pterostilbene significantly inhibited carcinogenic induced pareneoplastic breast
lesions. At checkout; type in coupon code " evolve " and Receive a 10% Discount Off Your Entire

the Caribbean , which is commonly referred to as velvet bean or cowitch . Mucuna pruriens has
been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to increase libido in both men and women. This
substance produces these effects due to the fact that it contains a considerable amount of
L-dopa , the building block of dopamine . Dopamine plays an important role in many brain
functions such as cognitive abilities, voluntary movements, sleep, mood, attention,
memory and learning. Therefore, administration of mucuna pruriens , with high
concentrations of levodopa , can help boost the brain function regulated by dopamine. In
addition to the aphrodisiac properties of mucuna pruriens , clinical studies have proven
that this substance has antioxidant properties which offer protection against
neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease . A study performed by AK Admani
published in Pharmacotherapeutics in 1985 evaluated the effects of levodopa on elderly
patients with Parkinson’s disease . The study consisted of 60 patients with Parkinson’s
disease . Patients were assessed before treatment, after one week of treatment, after three
weeks of treatment, after 6 weeks of treatment and at the end of the 12 weeks of treatment. The
results of the study yielded patients who were administered levodopa showed improvement and
less disability stemming from symptoms of Parkison’s . In addition, the levodopa group
showed increase in their daily independence than the non treated group. GABA – 300mg Alpha
Brain is also a very rich source of gamma amino-butyric acid , otherwise known as GABA . GABA , in
the human body, acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter . Unlike neurotransmitters such as
acetylcholine which stimulate the brain, inhibitory neurotransmitters are used to relax
the brain, regulate moods and moderate sleep patterns. There are several studies that have
proven a correlation between the administration of GABA and healthy sleep patterns. In
addition, clinical studies have also proven the effectiveness of GABA on reducing symptoms
associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety , epilepsy and bipolar
disorders . Oat Straw (10:1) – 300mg Oat straw , scientifically referred to as avena sativa ,
is also a component of Alpha Brain. There is considerable literature that states that the
consumption of oats and oat products offers benefits such as treatment for exhaustion ,
depression and stress . Oatstraw contains very high quantities of chemicals called
avenanthramides which have antioxidant benefits. A study performed by Mohsen Meydani at
Tufts University in 2006 revealed that avenanthramides contained within oatstaw had blood
pressure lowering benefits and also relaxed smooth muscle contractions. This data is useful
because reducing blood pressure and relaxing smooth muscle, the symptoms associated with
exhaustion, depression and stress will be alleviated. With the results of the Meydani study
and the documented relaxing effects of oatstraw due to the presence of avenanthramides ,
current research is being performed to evaluate the efficacy of oatstraw on such hyperactive
disorders such as ADD and ADHD . Positive preliminary results should encourage further
research on oatstraw as a viable option for treatment of these disorders. Vitamin B6 – 15mg
The final ingredient contained within Alpha Brain is vitamin B6 , scientifically known as
pyridoxine . Pyridoxine is an important vitamin for humans due to the fact that it promotes the
production of several neurotransmitters such as serotonin , GABA , melatonin , and
norepinephrine , which are essential for mood regulation, anxiety and pain perception. In
addition pyridoxine is essential for regulation of the body’s internal clock and
regulation of sleep habits. CONCLUSION It has been scientifically demonstrated that the
components of glyceryl phosphoryl choline , huperzia serrata , bacopa and vinpocetine all
have benefits to increase cognitive function, memory and focus. GPC choline has also been
shown to benefit athletes who compete in sports requiring feats of stamina such as marathons
and triathlons . The presence of the substances GABA , oat staw , and pyridoxine have been
proven scientifically to balance moods, regulate bodily rhythms and promote healthy sleep
patterns. Alpha Brain has the additional benefit of containing high powered antioxidants
such as pterostilbene, AC-11 ® and mucuna pruriens which offer protection against various
diseases such as heart disease, Parkinson’s disease and several forms of cancer, and these
claims are substantiated by several clinical trials. At checkout; type in coupon code "

What is Intelligence ? What is it that separates the great minds from the good minds? Raw
intelligence is a factor. But what is intelligence ? Is it the ability to access information
more quickly? Is it the ability to store more learned information more efficiently? Is it the
ability to induce connections between seemingly unrelated events? Is it the ability to stay
focused and determined? Is it the ability to dream things that have never been imagined
before? If that is what intelligence is, then Acetylcholine is the intelligence chemical.
Acetylcholine — The smart stuff One of the most important proven functions of
Acetylcholine is the improvement of Synaptic Plasticity . According to Wikipedia , “In
neuroscience , synaptic plasticity is the ability of the connection, or synapse , between two
neurons to change in strength in response to either use or disuse of transmission over
synaptic pathways .” To simplify the meaning of this, imagine your synapses like pieces of
metal trying to conduct electricity. If the metal is rigid and brittle the contact between
pieces will be limited and some energy from the transmission will be lost. If the metal soft and
malleable, like hot gold, they will lock together more easily and more efficiently transmit
energy, or in this case- data . Acetlylcholine is what makes your neurons malleable, which is
referred to technically as enhancing synaptic plasticity . The widely accepted Hebbian
theory states that “since memories are postulated to be represented by vastly
interconnected networks of synapses in the brain , synaptic plasticity is one of the
important neurochemical foundations of learning and memory .” Alphabrain – The most
powerful natural Acetylcholine booster? AlphaBrain boosts acetylcholine with a two
pronged strategy. First is to supply the body with the best natural form of Choline (GPC
Choline). Choline is the raw material from which acetylcholine is converted. The second
prong is the Huperzia Serrata, which contains the proven and tested Acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor Huperzine A. Acetylcholinesterase is the chemical that breaks down and disposes
of Acetylcholine . By inhibiting the breakdown of Acetylcholine , this means there is more
Acetylcholine to spare. We use full spectrum Huperzia Serrata which has advantages over
isolated Huperzine A. C reating a balanced N ootropic . One of the problems with traditional
acetylcholine boosters is that they throw the rest of your crucial brain chemicals out of
balance. Gaba , the chemical that regulates relaxation and peace of mind, Dopamine which has
been linked to attention , focus , emotional availabily, and Serotonin (the happy chemical)
all get overshadowed by the abundance of acetylcholine . We sought to change this by including
GABA and Mucuna Pruriens with standardized L-Dopa (the building block of Dopamine ) When
taken with RollOVER, the serotonin building powerhouse, all aspects of mental efficiency
will be raised equally and no imbalance will be created. The Alpha Brain is Relaxed and Clear In
order to crank up our acetlycholine power to the maximum while still staying relaxed we have
included an elephant dose of the trusted anti-anxiety herb Oatstraw in a 10x formulation.
This will keep you calm as a zen master no matter how challenging your tasks may be. In addition
to this we included the antioxidant powerhouses AC-11 , Bacopa , and Pterostilbene to
eliminate the free radicals clogging up the neural pathways , so you stay clear and energetic.

Dreaming Like an Alpha! Sleep 101 — The Importance of Dreams Sleep can be roughly grouped
into two categories, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep , and Slow Wave Sleep (SWS). Both of these
types of sleep provide different benefits to the human organism. Slow Wave Sleep is dreamless
and fosters bodily and systemic recovery. REM is the dreaming sleep, and plays the vital role
of helping the mind process the mental clutter and store the data that has accumulated
throughout the day. Studies have shown that without adequate REM sleep , people will
literally go insane and crash like a computer unable to reboot after accumulating too much
software. Conversely, strong creativity has been linked to strong REM sleep . Documented
stories of composers creating entire symphonies , and authors envisioning the entirety of a
published work while dreaming are commonplace. For the creative and active mind, REM sleep is
a crucial component, and recent research has indicated that the mechanism by which the body
controls REM is closely linked to the release of Acetlycholine . Acetylcholine Is the Key to
Strong REM Sleep Put quite simply, Acetlycholine release is greater during REM sleep than the
Non-REM sleep or Slow Wave Sleep . The greater the levels of Acetylcholine released, the more
persistent and intense the REM sleep . This has been studied by watching the function of memory
consolidation in correlation to acetylcholine . In scientific terms, “It is thought that
the release of acetylcholine in the neocortex controls the flow of information from the
hippocampus to the neocortex …which suggests that procedural memory consolidation may
depend more on REM sleep . It is proposed that REM sleep with high level of acetylcholine
enhance synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation .” Guis, S & Born 2004 in Power A.E.
2004 . Now whether dreaming is a causitive part of this memory consolidation process or a
byproduct of it is not exactly clear, but the correlation is proven beyond empirical doubt. So
to sum all this up : More Acetylcholine = More REM sleep = More powerful dreaming. Lucid Dreams :
The (Attainable) Holy Grail of Dreaming! Have you ever had a dream in which you became aware
that you were dreaming while you were still in the dream? If so, what did you do? Did you fly? Did
you explore sexual fantasies? Did you turn a nightmare around by kicking a whole lot of ass and
waking up feeling like Bruce Willis? That is the world of possibility open to the lucid dreamer
, and a quick example of why it is such a highly sought after state. Deirdre Barrett , in her 1992
study on lucid dreaming described four “corollaries” of lucidity: knowing that one
dreams, that objects will disappear after waking, that physical laws need not apply, and
having clear memory of the waking world. A true lucid dream has at least one, if not all of these
categories to qualify. An early recorded lucid dreamer was the philosopher and physician Sir
Thomas Browne (1605–1682). Browne was fascinated by the world of dreams and described his
own ability to lucid dream in his Religio Medici : “…yet in one dream I can compose a whole
Comedy, behold the action, apprehend the jests and laugh my self awake at the conceits
thereof.” A study on memory , testing the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor commonly known
as Galantamine reported Lucid Dreams as a side effect of the drug, proving the correlation
between increased levels of Acetylcholine and the possibility of more lucid dreams . It only
makes sense. If you have more time in the REM dream state , more intensity of your dream state,
why wouldn’t you have more of an opportunity to make them lucid? And there is no doubt that
Alpha Brain is a more powerful acetylcholine booster than galantamine … In fact, we believe
that AlphaBrain is the best naturally derived acetylcholine booster in the world. Alpha
Brain: The best naturally derived Acetylcholine booster in the world! Why is Alpha Brain the
best naturally derived Acetylcholine booster in the world? There are two main reasons.
First, we use the best quality, most bio-available, and not coincidentally the most
expensive variety of Choline , the raw source of Acetylcholine . GPC Choline ( Glyceryl
Phorsphoryl Choline ) is unrivaled for potentiality and generally accepted as the strongest
raw choline source, dwarfing the efficacy of choline bitrartate . Second, we include the
proven acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Huperzia Serrata , with standardized levels of
Huperzine A . Huperzine A has been studied successfully in conjunction with Alzheimers , and
the mechanism of inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine is well documented. What does
this mean so far? It means that not only will you have more raw materials to build acetylcholine
( GPC Choline ), you will also be actively preventing the breakdown and destruction of
acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase . By using full spectrum Huperzia Serrata instead of
Huperzine A , you also get the benefits of Huperzine B and myriad other supporting Alkaloids .
Next, consider the philosophy of our nootropic formula. Not only are we boosting
Acetlylcholine , we are also using Mucuna Pruriens to raise levels of L-Dopa , and including
GABA to make a well rounded and balanced brain formula. This in itself combats unnecessary
hyperactivity associated with higher levels of Acetlycholine , but we go even farther by
offering an elephant dose of the trusted anxiolytic Oat Straw in a 10x formlation. This allows
us to turn the mental power quotient up higher than other formulas, giving a maximum
acetylcholine charge, without the unwanted potential side effects. Finally let us consider
our other active ingredients. AC-11 , the patented ingredient extracted from the rainforest
herb cat’s claw is so powerful it has been proven to repair DNA ! In our formula this acts as a
nuclear antioxidant , eradicating free radicals that clog the neural pathways and create
mental fog. Pterostilbene and Bacopa are powerful cognitive enhancers in their own right and
Vinpocetine is a cerebral vasodilator that brings blood into the brain. With more blood comes
more nutrients and circulation, and that is always a good thing. At checkout; type in coupon

Every athlete knows what it feels like to be in the zone. Your focus is sharp, your anticipation
is quick, and you execute effortlessly. An entire field of sports psychology has grown up
around how to prepare the athlete’s mind to get into this state. Certainly emotional and
psychological factors play a role, but what if it is something to do with your actual brain
chemistry? What if enhanced acetylcholine not only increases your mental focus, but your
physical focus as well? What if enhanced dopamine levels improve athletic dexterity instead
of just general locomotion? What if GABA helps keep you cool and collected during the trials
and tribulations of competition? The answers to these questions have been insufficiently
studied in a clinical setting, but anecdotal evidence from the thousands of Alpha Brain users
point to one thing. Yes, There are golfers scoring lower than they have in years. There are
tennis players beating people they never have before. There are grapplers submitting people

Serotonin has been shown to be the key neurotransmitter linked to happiness, mood, and
positive outlook. With this in mind, New Mood is designed to be the most effective natural
serotonin booster ever created! Combining the two raw sources of serotonin , L-tryptophan
and 5-HTP , with a converting catalyst, Vitamin B6 , New Mood is a serotonin boosting
powerhouse. Adding to the naturally relaxing effects of L-Tryptophan are a host of herbs
designed to bring you into a state of relaxed calm. Magnesium is a natural anti-spasmodic
element vital for muscle relaxation, and vitamin D3 has further been linked to positive mood
benefits. Crucial for when you are under stress or dealing with exhaustion, New Mood is also
ideal for daily use. When combined with a regimen of Alpha Brain, all four major
neurotransmitter s, Serotonin , Dopamine , Acetylcholine and GABA are being provided with
nutrient precursors to help the body create maximum mental and emotional prowess. One
serving of our New Mood contains:

L-Tryptophan – 500 mg L-Tryptophan is an essential amino acid found naturally occurring in
turkey and other proteins . It is the building block for 5-HTP , the direct precursor of
Serotonin , however it is also available to convert to Melatonin , aiding in restfulness and
sleep. While the 5-HTP in the New Mood formula will be more immediately converted to Serotonin
with the help of the Pyridoxine (B6), the natural L-Tryptophan will act as a time release
serotonin booster as well as a calming and relaxing agent; Just like a Thanksgiving dinner but
without the 3000 calories! 5-HTP – 100 mg The direct precursor and metabolic intermediate
of serotonin , 5-HTP is the quickest way to restore and enhance the body’ natural supply of
serotonin . Low serotonin has been linked to depression , insomnia , anxiety , irritability ,
and poor mood. Lack of sleep and stress rapidly depletes the serotonin stores in the brain ,
which without supplementation can take weeks to recover to normal levels, making 5-HTP a
critical supplement in the New Mood formula. Magnesium (Chelate) - 200 mg Magnesium is needed
for hundreds of your body’s basic functions, including regulating your heart , blood
pressure and nervous system . Promoting a sense of muscular and physical calm, magnesium is
commonly used to combat both insomnia and anxiety . Many environmental and habitual causes
deplete your body’s magnesium store, exacerbating such unwanted side effects as jaw
clenching and muscle cramping . Magnesium can relax your muscles , calm the heart , and promote
restfulness and relaxation on a stressed system. Vitamin D3 – 1000 iu Vitamin D3 is vital to
maintaining proper blood levels of calcium and phosphorous , in addition to assisting in
cardiovascular health . It is provided to the body both through sunlight and nutritional
sources. For the New Mood formula, vitamin D3 plays a crucial role in improving mood.
According to one such study by scientists at Georgia State University : “The likelihood of
having depression in persons with vitamin D deficiency is significantly higher compared to
those with vitamin D sufficiency. Early diagnosis and intervention are paramount because
coexistence of vitamin D deficiency and depression has serious negative consequences on
health.” Chamomile (12% Apigenin) – 200 mg Another ancient and widely used herb, the
chamomile flower has long been sought for its calming, anti-anxiety properties. Our
standardized formula is the strongest available on the market, and will provide effects 10x
stronger than a cup of warm chamomile tea . Vitamin B6 – 20 mg Pyridoxine ( Vitamin B6 ) is one of
the body’s busiest vitamins, involved in an estimated 101 chemical reactions. One of its
primary tasks is to aid in the manufacturing of amino acids and neurotransmitters . Some of
these neurotransmitters are serotonin , norepinephrine , dopamine and GABA . Specifically
for the New Mood formula, B6 will be a key agent in assisting the conversion of L-tryptophan and
5-HTP to serotonin . Niacin – 30 mg Vitamin B3 is one of the most effective natural
vasodilators available. Opening up capillaries and blood vessels , Niacin allows the
restorative power of oxygenated blood to cleanse and detoxify the system. Chemical
intoxication in particular and the associated dehydration rapidly gives way to a retreat of
blood to the core of the body. Niacin helps return the blood to the skin, affecting an overall
sense of warmth as well as aiding in cleansing and recovery. Passion Flower (4% Flavinoids ) -
150 mg Passion Flower ( Passiflora incarnata ) is a plant native to the Americas , that has a long
history of traditional use as a mild sedative . Studies show extracts of passion flower have
both anti-anxiety and aphrodisiac properties, and is primarily used for the treatment of
restlessness and nervousness . Further benefits have been shown in alleviating rapid heart
rate and muscular spasms w. Valerian Root (4% Isovextin)- 200 mg Valerian root ,
scientifically known as valeriana officinalis , is a hardy, perennial flowering plant that
is native to Europe and parts of Asia . Valerian root has been used since the classical era of
ancient Greece as a treatment for anxiety and insomnia . Valerian has been used as a medicinal
herb since at least the time of ancient Greece and Rome . Valerian is most commonly used for
sleep disorders, especially the inability to sleep ( insomnia ). It is frequently combined
with hops , lemon balm , or other herbs that also cause drowsiness. Some people who are trying to
withdraw from the use of “ sleeping pills ” use valerian to help them sleep after they have
tapered the dose of the sleeping pill . Lemon Balm (4:1 Concentration) – 150 mg Lemon balm is a
perennial herb in the mint family native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean regions .
Studies have shown lemon balm to be effective as a mood enhancer and to increase cognitive
function. Jujube Seed Extract – 150mg T he Jujube tree has its origins in China but has
rapidly been cultivated throughout the world due to the prized medicinal properties of both
the fruit and the seed. The seed in particular is widely used as an herbal treatment for anxiety
and insomnia . Three specific compounds found within the seeds are responsible for this
effect: flavonoids , saponins , and polysaccharides and have been studied in several
clinical trials . The Science Of New Mood

New Mood is a nutrient based formula, marketed by Onnit Labs, designed to improve mood and
induce a sense of relaxation and calm. This formula contains bio-active concentrations of
L-Tryptophan , Magnesium Oxide , 5-Hydroxytryptophan , Pyridoxine , Niacin , Chamomile ,
Vitamin-D , Passion Flower , Valerian Root , Lemon Balm and Jujube Extract . Long evidence of
traditional use combined with scientific research support the likelihood that New Mood is
advantageous for mood enhancement, relaxation, stress relief and sleep regulation. 5-HTP
5-Hydroxytryptophan is a chemical that the body makes from tryptophan in order for the body to
produce serotonin . It should be noted that 5-Hydroxytryptophan is not present in foods as is
L-tryptophan . The amount of 5-Hydroxytryptophan the body can produce is limited to the
amount of tryptophan the body ingests. Clinical studies have shown that increased dietary
intake of 5-Hydroxytryptophan can provide natural mood enhancement. A study performed in
1991 by Dr. W. Poldinger of the Psychiatrische Universitatsklinik in Basel, Switzerland
evaluated the efficacy of 5-Hydroxytryptopan versus the administration of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors . Dr. Poldinger’s work consisted of a double blind,
multi-center controlled study of patients who were diagnosed with clinical depression . The
subjects of the study were either administered 100 mg of 5-Hydroxytryptopan three times per
day or 150 mg of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication three times per day. The
results of the study showed equal improvement of symptoms of clinical depression among both
groups with increased tolerance of the medication being shown among the group who was
administered 5-Hydroxytryptopan . The result of this study prove that 5-Hydroxytryptophan
is effective for treatment of clinical depression . L-Tryptophan L-Tryptophan is one of the
twenty standard amino acids and is an essential amino acid in the human body. An essential
amino acid means that is substance cannot be produced by the human body and must be obtained
through dietary measures. One major purpose of L-tryptophan is to act as the biochemical
precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin . Serotonin is the neurotransmitter
responsible for regulation of mood, appetite and sleep as well as some cognitive functions
such as learning and memory. Clinical studies have focused on the role of serotonin in the
regulation of mood and sleep and have had some positive results. A study performed by the
Department of Psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2002 evaluated
the role of L-tryptophan on mood and social interaction . This study involved human subjects
who were asked to ingest a mixture of amino acids that did not include tryptophan . The results
of the study revealed the human subjects exhibited a decline in tryptophan and in serotonin
which resulted in lower moods, increased irritability and aggression . Therefore this study
indicates that tryptophan contributes to higher levels of serotonin which in turn has
benefits for mood improvement benefits as well as decreasing irritability and aggression
which allows humans to obtain more constructive social interactions . An additional study
performed by D. Helmert-Schneider which was published in International
Pharmacopsychiatry in 1981 evaluated the efficacy of L-tryptophan as a sleep aid for
individuals suffering from chronic insomnia . This study format was a predictive,
double-blind study and all study subjects were severe chronic insomniacs with an average age
of 38.4 years. Subjects received a placebo for four consecutive nights and were then treated
with 2 grams of L-tryptophan after the placebo period. Sleep assessments were made by
polygraphic recordings. The study revealed highly significant sleep improvements when
subjects were treated with L-tryptophan . The results of this study confirms the claim of
L-tryptophan as a potent treatment for chronic insomnia . Magnesium (Chelate) Magnesium is a
mineral that is required by the human body for optimal health of many organs, especially the
heart , muscles and kidneys . There is also scientific evidence proving the effectiveness of
magnesium as a mood enhancer and a treatment for clinical depression . A study performed in
1991 by the Centre for Adaptive Disorders and Headache and the University of Pavia in Italy
evaluated the use of oral magnesium in relieving mood changes in premenstrual women . The
study was a randomized, double-blind study of 32 women, ages 24-39 with premenstrual
syndrome as confirmed by the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire . The treatment group
received 360 mg of Magnesium three times a day from the fifteenth day of the menstrual cycle to
the onset of menstrual flow . Blood samples for Magnesium measurements were obtained
pre-treatment and during the second and fourth months of treatment. Within the second month
of treatment, the group treated with Magnesium showed significant increase in Magnesium in
lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells as well as significantly lower scores of cluster
“pain” and “negative effect” on the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire . The
results of this study are encouraging for the use of Magnesium for enhancement of mood changes
associated with premenstrual syndrome . In addition, research performed by George Eby
Research in Austin, Texas evaluated the effect of Magnesium as a rapid recovery treatment for
major depression . This research reveals that only sixteen percent of magnesium found in
whole wheat remains in refined flour and that most of the magnesium is removed from the
drinking water supply. This combination may pre-disposed humans to magnesium deficiency.
The neurons in the brain require magnesium for proper function, and a deficiency of this
mineral may result in neuronal damage- wich may manifest as depression . This study revealed
that 125-300 mg of magnesium administered at meal times and before bedtime significantly
inhibited the conditions of headache , suicidal ideation , anxiety , irritability and
insomnia which are all characteristics of clinical depression . Vitamin B6 Pyroxidine ,
commonly known as vitamin B6 , is required for the body to obtain proper nutrients from the food
we eat, to increase production of red blood cells and to insure proper functioning of the
nervous system . Scientific evidence has shown that proper concentrations of pyridoxine in
the body can help reduce stress and allow the body to react properly to stressful situations. A
study performed in 1998 by the Department of Psychology at the University of Miami School of
Medicine evaluated the correlation between pyroxidine deficiency and psychological
distress on 76 recently bereaved men. Each candidate was subjected to several psychological
and psychosocial questionnaires as well as venipunctures to assess pyroxidine
concentrations. The results of the study revealed that pyridoxine deficiency was a
significant predictor of increased overall stress. In addition, this study concluded that
pyridoxine deficiency was significantly associated with increased depression , fatigue
and confused moods. Niacin Niacin has many health benefits such as lowering cholesterol ,
treating circulation problems, migraine headaches , and dizziness . There is also clinical
evidence that shows niacin , or nicotinic acid , has been used successfully as a treatment for
depression . A study performed by W.L. Tonge M.B., D.P.M consisted of fifteen patients who
were suffering from various forms of depression . The result of the study revealed
significant improvement of fourteen of the fifteen study subjects who were treated with
nicotinic acid . This study suggests a possible correlation between depression and cerebral
circulation . This study also opened the door for the evaluation of niacin for treatment of
other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease , chronic brain syndrome and
alcohol dependency . Chamomile (12% Apigenin) Chamomile is the common name for several
daisy-like plants which are most commonly used to make teas. Chamomile teas, have millennia
of traditional use for reducing anxiety and promoting sleep. Several clinical studies have
been performed to evaluate to efficacy of chamomile for treatment of anxiety and mood. One
study performed at the University of Pennsylvania consisted of a randomized, double-blind ,
placebo controlled trial testing the effects of chamomile in patients diagnosed with
generalized anxiety disorder. The study consisted of fifty seven subjects who either
received 220 mg of pharmaceutical grade German chamomile or a chamomile scented placebo
containing lactose . Anxiety was measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating as well as other
tests to measure changes in anxiety . The results of the study revealed the patients who were
treated with chamomile had a significant reduction in average scores on the Hamilton Anxiety
Rating as opposed to the placebo group. The results of this study confirm that chamomile has
benefits to reduced symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder . V itamin D3
Vitamin D can be obtained through foods such as fish , eggs and cod liver oil . Most of the
body’s vitamin D is obtained by the endogenous reaction when ultraviolet rays from the sun
come into contact with the skin to promote vitamin D synthesis . The main role of vitamin D in the
human body is to promote calcium absorption for normal healthy bone structure . Vitamin D
plays other roles such as cell proliferation , maintaining neuromuscular and immune
functions and reducing inflammation . There have been some clinical studies performed to
assess the function of vitamin D on mood and cognitive performance. A study performed in 2006
by the Department of Medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis,
Missouri evaluated vitamin D deficiency at the correlation between low mood and low
cognitive performance. The study consisted of a cross-sectional group of 80 subjects, 40
with mild Alzheimer’s Disease and 40 with dementia . Cognitive function was assessed by the
Short Blessed Test , Mini-Mental Exam, and Clinical Dementia Rating . Mood was assessed by
using the clinician’s diagnosis and the depression symptoms inventory. The results of the
study showed that deficiency of vitamin D was associated with active mood disorder. In
addition, individuals with vitamin D deficiency had a lower score on the Short Blessed Test
and a higher Clinical Dementia Rating. Vitamin D had no bearing on the scores of the
Mini-Mental Exam. Therefore, deficiency of vitamin D was associated with decreased moods
and impairment of two measures of cognitive performance. Passion Flower (4% Flavinoids)
Passion flower has been used for centuries in the Americas and Europe as a calming herb for
treatment of anxiety , insomnia and seizures . There is some literature confirming the fact
the passion flower increased the amount of gamma aminobutryric acid in the brain . The
department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care at Dr. Ali Shariati Hospital in Tehran, Iran
evaluated the use of passion flower to reduce anxiety in surgical patients. The study was a
randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of sixty patients who either received
500 mg of oral Passiflora incarnata or placebo as premedication ninety minutes prior to
surgery. A numerical rating scale was used to assess anxiety prior to, and at 10, 30, 60 and 90
minutes after premedication. The results of the study revealed the numerical rating scale
scores were significantly lower among the subjects who received Passiflora incarnata than
the scores among the placebo controlled group. The results of this study confirm the sedative
qualities of passion flower . Valerian Root (4% Isovextin) Valerian root , scientifically
known as valeriana officinalis , is a hardy, perennial flowering plant that is native to
Europe and parts of Asia . Valerian root has been used for centuries as a treatment for anxiety
and insomnia . A study performed by C. Stevinson and published in Sleep Medicine in 2000
evaulated the efficacy of valerian root on insomnia when compared to Oxazepam. A randomized,
double blind study consisting of 75 study subjects with documented nonorganic insomnia was
performed with subjects randomly chosen to receive 600 mg of commercial valerian extract or
10 mg of Oxazepam for a period of 28 days. Tools of measurement were questionnaires regarding
validated sleep, mood scale and anxiety , as well as a sleep rating from a physician. The
results of the study showed the same degree of effectiveness of valerian root and Oxazepam for
treatment of insomnia . It should be noted that the valerian root group tolerated the
medication better and reported fewer side effects that the Oxazepam group. Lemon Balm (4:1)
Lemon balm is a perennial herb in the mint family native to southern Europe and the
Mediterranean regions . Studies have shown lemon balm to be effective as a mood enhancer and to
increase cognitive function. A study performed in 2002 by the Human Cognitive Neuroscience
Unit at the University of Northumbria in Newcastle, United Kingdom evaluated the modulation
of mood and cognitive performance following acute administration of lemon balm . The study
was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, balanced crossover study which
contained twenty young, healthy participants. Study subjects received single doses of 300,
600 and 900 mg of lemon balm or a matching placebo at seven day intervals. Cognitive function
was assessed using the Cognitive Drug Research computerized test battery . Mood was assessed
using the Bond-Lader mood scales . Both were assessed prior to treatment and at 1, 2.5, 4 and 6
hours after administration. The results of the study showed improvement of accuracy and
attention following 600 mg of lemon balm and time and dose specific reductions in both
secondary memory and working memory. Calmness and alertness was significantly reduced at
all time points following the highest dose. This study confirms the anxiolytic properties of
lemon balm . I n conclusion New Mood is justified in marketing itself as a novel formula for mood
enhancement, relaxation, stress relief and sleep regulation. Scientific studies were
performed on each ingredient contained within the New Mood formula and every ingredient
contained within New Mood have a history of use in enhancing mood, promoting relaxation, and
assisting in healthy sleep. It should be noted that very few side effects were documented
during the clinical trials of any ingredient contained in the New Mood and lends strong
support for a very positive safety profile. When taken as directed, New Mood should prove to be
a highly safe and effective in healthy adults. At checkout; type in coupon code " evolve " and

There is perhaps no single more important hormone when it concerns mood and happiness than
Serotonin . According to Web MD “Of the approximately 40 million brain cells , most are
influenced either directly or indirectly by serotonin . This includes brain cells related to
mood , sexual desire and function , appetite , sleep , memory , learning , temperature
regulation , and some social behavior . It’s easy to see why serotonin would be called “the
happiness neurotransmitter ”. Low Serotonin Is A Downer Genetic and psychosomatic
reasons aside, one of the most prevalent causes of low serotonin has to do with sleep. It is
believed that during the deeper sleep cycles, the major neurotransmitters are restored–
and serotonin is no exception. Therefore if you are not sleeping well- then you are probably
not producing an adequate amount of serotonin . This presents a dilemma for those both
"working hard and playing hard" in particular. In addition to the damage done by any and all
intoxicants , we are not producing enough serotonin in our sleep to bounce back. Serotonin :
The Pharmaceutical Solution With this litany of positive influences, it is no surprise
therefore that the target of many classes of anti-depressant pharmaceuticals all involve
the serotonin mechanism in the brain. SSRI’s ( Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors )
are one of the most popular classes, and include: Selexa , Paxil , Prozac , and Zoloft to name a
few. It is believed that they act by preventing the processing ( reuptake ) of serotonin by
certain cells, therefore creating a surplus of available serotonin . The surplus of
serotonin fosters better mood, outlook, and general ability to handle stressful
situations. However, while these drugs have been proven effective in treating depression ,
natural treatments like 5-HTP have some positive research indicating evidence of benefit
with very few adverse effects. A study performed in 1991 by Dr. W. Poldinger of the
Psychiatrische Universitatsklinik in Basel, Switzerland evaluated the efficacy of
5-Hydroxytryptopan versus the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
for treatment of clinical depression . Dr. Poldinger’s work consisted of a double blind,
multi-center controlled study of patients who were diagnosed with clinical depression . The
subjects of the study were either administered 100 mg of 5-Hydroxytryptopan three times per
day or 150 mg of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication three times per day. The
results of the study showed equal improvement of symptoms of clinical depression among both
groups with increased tolerance of the medication being shown among the group who was
administered 5-Hydroxytryptophan . More Serotonin The Natural Way: L-tryptophan and 5-HTP
T he building blocks of Serotonin begin with the amino acid L-tryptophan . L-tryptophan is
commonly found in high amounts in both turkey and bananas, and on its own- has a mild relaxing
and soporific effect. This is one of the reasons that after a large turkey dinner, everyone
feels so sleepy! A portion of L-tryptophan however, also gets converted to 5-HTP (
5-hydroxytryptophan ) which is the direct precursor to Serotonin ( 5-HT or
5-Hydroxytryptamine ). At this point the amount and availability of pyridoxine ( Vitamin B6 )
is thought to play a role in determining the rate by which L-tryptophan and 5-HTP are converted
along the chain of reactions to Serotonin . Supplementing your body with L-tryptophan and
5-HTP have not been shown to create a dependency or lower baseline levels of serotonin , as they
represent restoring serotonin through the body’s natural and usual channels. Vitamin B-6
: The Key to Converting 5-HTP to Serotonin 5-HTP does not convert to serotonin by sheer magic.
It requires a catalyst in the chemical process, which is an enzyme derived from Vitamin B-6 .
Vitamin B-6 is perhaps the rarest and most expensive of the B-Vitamins , and yet is one of the
most important. While a small amount of B-6 will be present from foods, without additional
supplementation of B-6 much of the 5-HTP and L-Tryptophan payload may not reach culmination
as serotonin . It would be like dropping a crate of supplies to starving villagers without
giving them a way to open up the crate! This is one thing that separates New Mood from many other
formulas out there. New Mood has 30mg of Vitamin B-6 per serving, which is more than enough to
assist in the serotonin conversion process. At checkout; type in coupon code " evolve " and
Receive a 10% Discount Off Your Entire Purchase! 5 Advantages of New Mood: 1. Dosing: New Mood
contains 100 mg of 5-HTP and 500 mg of L-Tryptophan , which is just as much or more than any stand
alone supplement of 5-HTP or L-tryptophan . 2. Time Release Effect: By including both 5-HTP
and L-tryptophan New Mood creates a virtual time release effect. While the 5-HTP will boost
serotonin stores quickly, L-tryptophan is farther up the reaction chain, and so it converts
first to 5-HTP and then Serotonin , creating a longer lasting process . 3. Vitamin B6 : As
mentioned above, vitamin B-6 is the catalyst that allows the body to create serotonin from
5-HTP . This is no secret, and yet still, most companies that sell 5-HTP and L-tryptophan do not
include it in their formula, or if they do it is in such a minimal dose as to be questionably
effective. Why don’t they include it? It comes down to cost. 5-HTP , L-Tryptophan , and
Vitamin B-6 are three of the most expensive compounds to source as raw materials. To include
Vitamin B-6 drives up the cost of the product, and they realize that most people are unaware of
the vital necessity of B-6 so might as well keep that money for themselves. We do not have the
overhead like these massive pill manufacturers, and can absorb the added cost to ensure that
you get the most effective product possible. 4 . Sleep produces Serotonin : While nothing in
our formula is a ‘sedative’ there are many ingredients included that are highly relaxing
and promote deeper sleep cycles. Magnesium relaxes the muscles and our powerful 10x
standardized chamomile , and 4x lemon balm and valerian relaxes and appeases the mind. Better
sleep means more serotonin for you. 5. Better circulation: We included Niacin , a known
vasodilator which improves flow through the smaller capillaries in the circulatory system
and induce a sense of warmth. Find Your Nirvana

Unlock Your Mental & Emotional Potential for Happiness The Buddha described life as a state of
suffering. The opposite of which is a state free of suffering, which he called Nirvana .
Contributing to suffering is a host of psychological and emotional attachments best left for
the Masters to discuss, but outside of that is a baseline of biological and chemical factors
that are affected by the nutrients and supplements we ingest. The primary biochemical factor
linked to happiness is the neurotransmitter serotonin . An entire industry of
pharmaceuticals has been developed to regulate and maximize the prevalence of serotonin ,
but New Mood takes the natural approach. L-tryptophan , commonly found in turkey and bananas
is an essential amino acid which converts to 5-HTP , the direct precursor of serotonin . New
Mood contains both 5-HTP and L-tryptophan , creating an immediate and time elease effect,
that with the catalyst of the additional Vitamin B6, turns the body into a serotonin building
power-plant! Besides low levels of serotonin , generally caused by inadequate nutrients or a
lack of deep SWS sleep , the next greatest antagonist to happiness is stress. Stress creates
cortisol which over time begins to wreak havoc on body chemistry. Niacin and magnesium are
included in New Mood along with a host of herbs with thousands of years of traditional use in
order to combat stress and induce a state of calm and relaxation. New Mood is ideal to
compliment Alpha Brain, as when both are taken as part of a regimen, the body has everything it
needs to enhance the major neurotransmitters , as defined by Dr. Eric Braverman. This means
that you can be at your mental and emotional best. From there, it is up to you to end your own
suffering and find your Nirvana ...

Cordyceps Sinensis (Full Spectrum) – 1200mg Several thousand years ago high in the
mountains of Tibet , herdsmen noticed that when their herds grazed on caterpillar fungus ,
they were noticeably more lively, energetic, and could stay on the move for far longer. Taking
a lesson from their animal kin, they sampled the mushroom and found a similar effect.
Unbeknown to them were the mechanisms of action behind this highly prized mushroom.
Containing the active ingr edients adenosine and cordycepic acid, as well as a host of
phytonutrients , cordyceps has been proven to increase oxygen utilization, aerobic
capacity, and cellular energy through the production of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate).
Cultivated in optimal conditions by Aloha Medicinals, our Cordyceps is the strongest in the
world and ideal for both casual and professional athletes of all types. Chromium Chelate –
3mg Chromium often overlooked as a very important mineral for bodily functions, primarily
energy and the maintenance of proper blood sugar levels . In cooperation with naturally
produced GTF ( Glucose Tolerance Factor ) it enhances insulin , which results in the sugars
passing quicker into the cells. Chromium chelate (picolinate) is the best absorbed form of
chromium and has been used as a carbohydrate -burning supplement for some time very
successfully. Magnesium Chelate – 75mg Magnesium is an essential mineral that can only
enter the body through nutritional or supplemental sources. It is required by virtually
every cell , and vital in more than 300 chemical processes particularly important to the
athlete . Some of these include muscle contraction and relaxation , nerve function , cardiac
activity, blood pressure regulation , hormonal interactions, immunity , bone health and
synthesis of proteins, fats and nucleic acids. Magnesium is also crucial for energy
metabolism by the activation of enzymes known as ATPases , which are needed to generate ATP (
adenosine triphosphate ). When ATP is broken down, energy is released for all muscle
contractions , and when exercising strenuously, this turnover is extremely high, meaning
that ATP needs to be synthesized quickly. Thus, a shortfall of magnesium can limit energy
production, leading to fatigue , lethargy , reduced power, muscle twitches or cramps .The
chelated form of magnesium used in Shroomtech Sport makes it easier to digest and absorb .
Rhodiola Rosea – 225mg Rhodiola rosea herb grows in the Arctic regions of eastern Siberia .
Russians have drunk rhodiola tea for centuries as an energy booster and Russian and Chinese
scientists have researched the benefits of Rhodiola root for several decades. The root has a
reputation for stimulating the nervous system , fighting depression , enhancing work
performance, decreasing fatigue , and reducing high altitude sickness . This herb has been
categorized as an adaptogen by Russian researchers due to its observed ability to increase
resistance to a variety of chemical, biological, and physical stressors. The adaptogenic ,
cardiopulmonary protective, and central nervous system activities of rhodiola rosea root
have been attributed primarily to its ability to influence levels and activity of monoamines
and opioid peptides such as beta-endorphins . Interestingly, in smaller doses, the herb is
more stimulating than larger doses. Cordyceps (Pure) — 600 mg Produced for Onnit Labs by
Aloha Medicinals, this extract is the strongest available form of cordyceps on the market
today. Extensive research in creating bio-identical mushrooms to those naturally
occurring in the wild has set aloha apart as the elite cordyceps producer, and this is their
flagship achievement. Green Tea Extract (standardized to at least 95 % polyphenols , 75%
catechins , 45% EGCG) – 300 MG Green tea has been associated with good health for 1000′s of
years, but only recently has science understood exactly why. With the combination of cat
echins , polyphenols and the highly potent EGCG , green tea extract has been shown to be 20 times
more antioxidant -active than Vitamin C . Particularly valuable in scavenging lipid
free-radicals this ancient and powerful antioxidant will be a major ally in protecting
against the neurotoxicity of excessive vital exertion. In addition, green tea will offer its
well known effects on energy and metabolism . Siberian Ginseng (50:1) – 150mg Siberian
Ginseng is a tall, prickly shrub native to Russia , China , Korea and Japan . It is known for its
anti-fatigue, energy-lifting properties and its ability to help prevent stress-induced
ailments. Siberian Ginseng is routinely used by Russia n athletes to improve their stamina ,
reflexes , coordination and athletic performance. Siberian Ginseng contains choline , a
brain chemical thought to be integral to learning and memory retention . This helps improve
mental performance and alertness while its antioxidant properties prevent cellular damage
due to oxidation . It is has a strong synergy with Rhodiola which should add both energy and
protection for our formula. Astragalus – 50mg Astragalus root is widely used in
traditional Chinese medicine for its immuno-stimulating properties. It is highly
synergistic with active medicinal mushroom alkaloids and helps to unlock the potential of
cordyceps sinensis . Alpha Lipoic Acid – 25mg Alpha lipoic acid is a fatty acid found
naturally inside every cell in the body. It’s needed by the body to convert glucose into
energy to maintain our body’s normal functions. Perhaps the most widely known use of alpha
lipoic acid is as a strong antioxidant . What makes this antioxidant unique is that it
functions in both water and fat, unlike the more common antioxidants vitamins C and E , and it
appears to be able to recycle antioxidants such as vitamin C and glutathione after they have
been used up. Glutathione is an important antioxidant that helps the body eliminate toxic
substances. Methylcobalamin – 3000 mcg B12 is one of the most popular energy-associated B
vitamins, however by unlucky accident the most common lab-produced form of B12 is
cyanocobalamin, not Methylcobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is created through charcoal
filtering and leaves the body to shed a small amount of excess Cyanide . We are using the the
coenzyme form of vitamin B12 , known as methylcobalamin or methyl B12 . It’s the only form of
vitamin B12 which can directly participate in homocysteine metabolism . In addition,
converting homocysteine to methionine via methyl B12 generates an increased supply of SAMe (
S-adenosyl methionine ), the body’s most important methyl donor. Indeed, some of the
benefits of methyl B12 , such as protection from neurotoxicity , appear to derive from
increased production of SAMe . Particularly of value to late night revelers, available
information indicates that methylcobalamin can modulate circadian rhythm (your 24-hour
clock). Pre-dosing before a long night out with Methylcobalamin may lead to quicker recovery
of normal sleep cylcles and refreshing sleep. Because of methylcobalamin ’s impact on
24-hour clock and the cycles that feed of this, it is also an important vitamin to regulate your
24-hour release of the hormone cortisol which is released in large quantities when one is
under stress. The Science Behind ShroomTech Sport

S hroomTech Sport combines a host of all-natural, competition safe nutrients, led by the
traditionally revered Chinese ‘caterpillar mushroom’ cordyceps sinensis . Cordyceps
enjoyed the distinction of being the world’s most expensive nutritional supplement for
much of the 20th century. Recent advances in cultivation combined with the publicity from the
success at the 1993 Beijing national games have increasingly brought it into scientific
interest. Therapeutic applications of Cordyceps and its extracts are hypothesized to be
centered primarily on the key effects of increased oxygen utilization, increased cellular
ATP production and the stabilization of blood sugar metabolism. The presence of adenosine ,
cordycepin , and cordycepic acid; polysaccharides ; vitamins ; and trace elements may be, at
least partially, the cause for such effects. An increase in cellular ATP results in an
increase in useful energy. This is in contrast to the perceived increase in energy that occurs
from the use of CNS stimulants , such as caffeine , ephedrine , and amphetamines , which
ultimately results in an energy deficiency. This is a distinct advantage that an ATP focused
energy product like Shroom Tech Sport has over other ‘pre workout’ stimulant based
formulas. There is a naturally occurring amount of caffeine in the green tea extract found in
the formula, guaranteed to be less than 100mg per dose. I t should be noted that cordyceps and
the Russian adaptogen rhodiola have been identified as being particularly synergistic , and
many of the studies done on performance included rhodiola , as does ShroomTech Sport. Human
Studies On Cordyceps Cordyceps Increases Oxygen Utilization By 50% i n a double- blind study
published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise researchers gave 30 male athletes either
cordyceps or a placebo . The athletes did not change their exercise routine during the study.
After six weeks, the cordyceps group’s oxygen intake was almost double the placebo
group’s. Oxygen intake is crucial to supplying nutrients to the muscles and preventing
fatigue and the buildup of lactic acid . Cordyceps increases Aerobic Capacity by 9% In another
study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 30 healthy elderly Chinese
people took either 3 g of cordyceps daily or a placebo . After six weeks, aerobic capacity in the
cordyceps group increased 9 percent, which researchers say produced higher energy levels,
while those taking the placebo saw no energy change. Human Studies On Cordyceps Combined with
Rhodiola A Groundbreaking 130 Patient Double Blind Trial Show Increases in Aerobic Capacity
in Proprietary Cordyceps / Rhodiola Blend One hundred thirty one healthy male volunteers,
volunteers between the ages of 40-70 were enrolled in a double blind , randomized, placebo
controlled study by the Rippe Lifestyle Institute of Shrewsbury, MA . The study employed
sports physiology methods, measuring exercise capacity, endurance performance, and
exercise related metabolic alterations before, in the middle of, and after the 12-week study
treatment with the proprietary blend of Cordyceps and Rhodiola named CordyMax. The results
are as follows. (1) Maximal exercise– Peak volume of oxygen (VO2peak) consumption was
increased by 5.5%. The time to VO2peak was increased by 4.1% in CordyMax group. (2)
Sub-maximal, endurance exercise–The time for 1-mle walk was reduced by 29 sec in CordyMax
group (p=0. 05) Exercise work output by use of Jeukendrup bike test was increased by 8% over
placebo . (3) Body Weight was reduced by 1.2% in CordyMax group vs placebo · (4) Diastolic
blood pressure was reduced by 3.2% in CordyMax group (p=0.045) Training In Altitude With
Cordyceps Decreases Cortisol and Improves Treadmill Running. 18 healthy male subjects
between the ages of 19 and 20 were taken into high altitude and divided into two groups, one
receiving 1400 mg of Cordyceps and Rhodiola , while the other received an identical placebo .
The group receiving the Cordyceps showed increased EPO sensitivity, decreased cortisol
levels and significant improvement in treadmill running vs the control group . Cordyceps
Significantly Improves Vo2 Max , Oxygen Uptake, Aerobic Capacity, and Resistance to Fatigue
In Double Blind Trial . Thirty seven healthy chinese subjects were given either a proprietary
combination of Cordyceps and Rhodiola , or identical placebo capsules. Their exercise
performance was tested before and after 6 weeks of treatment with a symptom-limited,
incremental work rate protocol on a cycle ergometer . Maximum oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) was
measured using a metabolic chart. The results showed a statistically significant
improvement in VO2 max , energy levels, and exercise capability. Animal Studies on Cordyceps
Mouse Swim Test Shows Significant Increase in Time-To-Exhaustion. Among the simplest and
most reliable tests that is used to determine a compound’s ability to increase the energy
output of a subject or decrease fatigue is the mouse swim test. In this test, two groups of mice
are used. One group receives a standard diet, whereas the other receives the same diet, with
the addition of the test-compound. In a study done in 1999 cordyceps was tested in such a
fashion. After a period of time, the two groups are put into a steep-sided container filled
with water, from which escape is not possible. In this way, the animals are forced to swim. The
"time-to-exhaustion" is measured for the two groups, and the results are compared and
contrasted. If the group receiving the test compound swims longer than the group on the
standard diet without the test compound, then it has been determined that they had increased
energy output/ decreased fatigue, when compared to the control group. Trials of this nature
have been conducted using Cordyceps as the test compound and have invariably shown the use of
Cordyceps to significantly increase the time-to-exhaustion in laboratory animals over
their control groups. Increase In Cellular ATP Proven in Animal Models. A few animal studies
have shown cordyceps feeding to increase the ratio of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to
inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) in the liver by 45-55% TOXICITY Cordyceps has proven to be a nontoxic
fungal substance with wide-ranging physical and chemical effects on the body. No human
toxicity has been reported, and animal models failed to find an LD50 ( median lethal dose )
injected i.p . in mice at up to 80 g/kg per day, with no fatalities after 7 days.1,3 Given by mouth
to rabbits for 3 months, at 10 g/kg per day (n = 6), no abnormalities were seen from blood tests or
in kidney or liver function. Human Studies On Additional Shroom Tech Ingredients Green Tea
Supplement Improves Cycling Time Trials At Sim. Altitude i n a double blind clinical trial
performed at Texas Tech university , 9 of 10 cyclists given green tea extract performed
significantly better in time trials at simulated altitude. In addition, their average power
output was shown to be significantly improved. According to the examining doctors: “
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) or free radicals are unstable molecules that have been
implicated in the processes of muscle damage and fatigue . Previous studies have shown that
both exercise and hypoxia associated with altitude exposure result in increased production
of ROS. Catechins in green tea extract (GTE) are powerful antioxidants capable of scavenging
ROS and possibly preventing muscle damage and fatigue .” At checkout; type in coupon code "
