Brian Adams



    LostWrestlers.com Opinion :Â  What a sad end to an amazing performer's life.Â 
    Adams had kicks like Shawn Michaels and had power like Kevin Nash.Â  He never really got
    "over" with fans as a singles wrestler but was always in the title hunt when it came to tag
    team competition.Â  Adams was thrown right into the WWE's spotlightÂ when he
    debuted in April of 1990Â with an already championshipÂ caliber Demolition
    team.Â  Everyone knew he was here to stay when he proved he could hold his own
    withÂ Demolition partnersÂ Axe and Smash.

    Early life

    

    Brian Adams was born in Kona, Hawaii and was raised in Kealakekua, Hawai'i and attended
    Konawaena High School . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] After graduating from high school, Adams joined the
    military, where he began boxing. [ 5 ] It was during his time in the military, while
    stationed in Japan, that he was also exposed to wrestling. Adams was trained in wrestling
    by famed Japanese wrestler and mixed martial artist Antonio Inoki . [ 5 ] In 1986, after
    training in Japan, Adams came to the United States and began working in Portland, Oregon
    's Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW). [ 1 ]

    Professional wrestling career

    

    Pacific Northwest Wrestling (1986â€“1990)

    

    In the Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW) promotion, he was given the nickname The
    American Ninja and was put in a tag team called "The Wrecking Crew" with Len Denton , who
    wrestled under a mask, billed as "The Grappler." Adams and Denton were the Pacific
    Northwest Tag Team Champions for a time and worked a feud with the Southern Rockers, Steve
    Doll and Rex King . [ 6 ] In 1990, he won the Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship
    after winning a tournament final match against Larry Oliver in Portland on April 21, 1990
    for the vacant title. [ 6 ] He lost the title to Scott Norton on May 12, 1990 in Portland. [ 6 ]

    World Wrestling Federation (1990â€“1991)

    

    In April 1990, while still working for the PNW, Adams debuted in the World Wrestling
    Federation (WWF) as Crush, the third member of the WWF World Tag Team Championship team
    Demolition . [ 7 ] With Adams joining Demolition, the stable exercised the Freebird Rule
    allowing any combination of the three to defend the tag team title, which allowed Crush to
    become a World Tag Team Champion without being involved in the match where the team won the
    title. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] At the SummerSlam pay-per-view in 1990, Demolition, with new member
    Adams, lost the Tag Team title to The Hart Foundation in a two out of three falls match with
    Adams getting pinned for the final fall to lose the title. [ 9 ] After SummerSlam,
    Demolition resumed an earlier feud with The Legion of Doom . [ 7 ] Adams continued to
    perform as part of Demolition until after WrestleMania VII where he and Smash lost to
    Genichiro Tenryu and Koji Kitao . After WrestleMania, the WWF decided to disband
    Demolition as a team. [ 8 ]

    Return to PNW (1991â€“1992)

    

    Upon his departure from the WWF, Adams, who continued to use the Demolition Crush gimmick
    , returned to PNW. [ 10 ] He was portrayed as a dominant wrestler, winning both the Pacific
    Northwest Tag Team Championship and the Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship.
    Adams received the first of these two championships during this stint in the PNW while
    teaming with previous rival Steve Doll and defeating The Bruise Brothers for the Tag Team
    Championship on July 27, 1991 in Portland, Oregon . [ 6 ] They remained the champions until
    September 1, 1991 when they lost the title to The Grappler and Don Harris . [ 6 ] A little more
    than a month later, Adams received his second Pacific Northwest Heavyweight title, on
    October 12, 1991, in Portland after he defeated Rip Oliver via submission to the Full
    Nelson hold. [ 6 ] Adams was the champion for just over three months, losing the title to Ron
    Harris at a show in Portland, on January 18, 1992. [ 6 ]

    Return to WWF (1992â€“1998)

    

    Kona Crush (1992â€“1993)

    

    Adams went back to work for the WWF in 1992 and was given a new fan favorite character: an
    easygoing surfing Hawaiian , occasionally referred to as Kona Crush, who wore bright
    neon tights and utilized a new two-handed skull vice finisher called the Coconut Crush. [
    7 ] Crush made his televised debut in WWF under his new character on May 9, 1992 episode of
    Superstars , defeating Kato . He feuded early on with his former tag team partner Barry
    Darsow (Smash) who was now known as Repo Man. [ 1 ] Two years after losing the tag team title,
    the two clashed at SummerSlam , where Crush was victorious. [ 11 ] Crush then engaged in a
    feud with Doink the Clown , after he was attacked with a loaded prosthetic arm while
    confronting the clown about his cruel pranks on children at ringside, which caused Crush
    to miss the Royal Rumble. The feud culminated at WrestleMania IX , where Crush lost after a
    second, identical Doink (played by Steve Keirn ) appeared from underneath the ring and
    struck Crush with the prosthetic arm. [ 7 ] At the first King of the Ring pay-per-view,
    Crush challenged Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship , but lost the
    match after a distraction by Doink. [ 12 ]

    On July 4 1993, Crush injured his back in the stars and stripes challenge trying to
    bodyslam WWF Champion Yokozuna . On the July 12 edition of Monday Night RAW, Crush faced
    Yokozuna for the WWF Championship in a losing effort. To send a message to Lex Luger ,
    Yokozuna performed several Banzai Drops to Crush, leaving him off TV for several months.

    Heel Run (1993â€“1995)

    

    Crush returned in the fall of 1993 and attacked his on-screen friend Randy Savage ,
    because Savage had encouraged him to enter the Body Slam Challenge, and had failed to
    contact him during recuperation. Crush then allied himself with Yokozuna and Mr. Fuji , [
    7 ] becoming a villain . Adams adopted a "Japanese sympathizer" gimmick to go with his new
    attitude, including growing a beard, using face paint, and wearing darker colours
    (black, purple and silver). This rivalry led to a falls count anywhere match against
    Savage at WrestleMania X , which he lost when Savage hogtied him to a metal rack and
    returned to the ring before a 60 second count. The match with Savage is notable for being
    Savage's final Wrestlemania appearance to date. [ 7 ] [ 13 ]

    In January 1995, Adams took part in the 1995 Royal Rumble match as the 30th entrant in the
    elimination match. He eliminated Billy Gunn , Bart Gunn , Brian Clark , and Fatu before
    being eliminated by Davey Boy Smith . Shortly after he was arrested, and subsequently
    jailed, for purchasing steroids and possessing an illegal hand gun, while home in Hawaii
    . After a brief stint in jail, Adams was brought back to the WWF with a new biker look at the
    beginning of the Monday Night Wars in 1996, with his real-life incarceration being
    referenced as part of a storyline on Monday Night Raw . [ 1 ] Upon his return, the WWF gave
    Adams Clarence Mason , who portrayed a lawyer-like character on-screen, as a manager. [ 7
    ]

    Nation of Domination, Disciples of Apocalypse & Departure (1996â€“1997)

    

    Shortly after his return to the WWF he was made a member of the Nation of Domination (NOD)
    along with Faarooq and Savio Vega . [ 7 ] Adams was later kicked out of the group, and
    subsequently formed and led a wrestling biker gang stable called the Disciples of
    Apocalypse (DOA). [ 7 ] The DOA feuded with Faarooq's NOD and Vega's new stable, called Los
    Boricuas . [ 1 ] Adams later left the WWF in 1997, partially in protest to the Montreal
    Screwjob . [ 5 ]

    World Championship Wrestling (1998â€“2001)

    

    Adams signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1998 and debuted as part of the
    New World Order . [ 7 ] As a lower card performer, he often tag teamed with the likes of Scott
    Norton and Stevie Ray , occasionally losing matches against smaller and lesser known
    wrestlers. However, he also gained squash victories over jobbers in singles
    competition. During his time with the promotion, he was involved in a tag team tournament
    steel cage match on WCW Thunder in February 1999, in which he and Horace Hogan lost to Chris
    Benoit and Dean Malenko .

    Later, he formed a team with Bryan Clark called KroniK , which won the WCW World Tag Team
    Championship twice. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]

    Later career (2001â€“2002)

    

    After the WWF's purchase of WCW, KroniK appeared in WWF as part of the Alliance storyline.
    During their time in WWF, they were managed by Steven Richards and were placed in a short
    feud with the Brothers of Destruction ( The Undertaker and Kane ). [ 7 ] Adams and Clark
    faced, and lost to, the duo at the 2001 Unforgiven pay-per-view. [ 1 ] Both men were
    accosted by the Undertaker in the locker room after the match for their lackluster
    performance. Clark was then released from his WWF contract, and Adams was sent to the then
    WWF developmental territory Heartland Wrestling Association in Cincinnati, Ohio
    where he performed until he, too, was released from his WWF contract in November 2001.

    Adams and Clark briefly worked for World Wrestling All-Stars in early 2002. They then
    traveled to Japan to work for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). On July 17, 2002, at an AJPW
    pay-per-view, Adams and Clark defeated Keiji Mutoh and TaiyÅ� Kea for the AJPW
    Unified World Tag Team Championship . [ 5 ] Adams and Clark remained champions until 2002
    when AJPW declared the title vacant, because Adams had left the promotion to pursue a
    boxing career. [ 5 ]

    Adams was scheduled to have his first boxing match, against Rick Zufal, on November 16,
    2002 at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada with professional
    wrestler Randy Savage in his corner. [ 14 ] This bout was to air on the Never Surrender
    boxing pay-per-view, but during his training for the bout, Adams injured his shoulder
    and was unable to fight. [ 7 ] [ 15 ] After recovering from his shoulder injury, Adams
    returned to wrestling for "Wrestle 1", a pay-per-view for the Japanese promotion W-1,
    which was held at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. In January 2003, he made his last in-ring
    performance, teaming with Bryan Clark, and facing Bill Goldberg and Keiji Mutoh in a
    losing effort. He suffered a spinal injury in this match that forced him into retirement.
    [ 7 ]

    Personal life

    

    In 1996, Adams had an uncredited role in the Bollywood movie Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi . In the
    movie, he played "Crush" and was killed by " The Undertaker " (played by Brian Lee ) in a
    wrestling match.

    After retiring from professional wrestling, Adams had surgery to attempt to correct his
    spinal injury, but it left him unfit to continue to wrestle. [ 16 ] Following his
    retirement, Adams became a bodyguard for his longtime friend, wrestler-turned- rapper
    Randy Savage, who was touring to promote his CD, Be a Man . [ 17 ] It was reported that Adams
    was living on income from a Lloyd's of London insurance policy . [ 1 ] Adams expressed
    interest in opening a health club in Tampa, Florida , which was to be a franchise of fellow
    wrestler Marc Mero 's "Body Slam" training center. [ 18 ]

    Death

    

    On August 13, 2007, Adams was found unconscious in his bed by his wife at their Tampa,
    Florida home. She called 911, but he was pronounced dead by paramedics after they
    arrived. He was 44 years old. Adams reportedly received illegal steroids in February
    2006, including nandrolone , testosterone and HGH . These drugs were speculated to have
    played a role in his death. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]
