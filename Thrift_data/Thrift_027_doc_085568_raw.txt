Belgrade Â ( Serbian :Â  Ð‘ÐµÐŸÐ³Ñ€Ð°ÐŽ ,Â  Beograd ) is theÂ 
capital Â and largest city ofÂ  Serbia . The city lies onÂ  two international
waterways , at the confluence of theÂ  Sava Â andÂ  Danube Â rivers, where the
Pannonian Plain Â meets theÂ  Balkan Peninsula . With a population of 1,630,000
(official estimate 2007) [ 3 ] , Belgrade is the largest city in the territory of theÂ  former
Yugoslavia , second largest city on theÂ  Danube river [ 4 ] Â and the fourth largest
inÂ  Southeastern Europe , afterÂ  Istanbul ,Â  Athens , andÂ  Bucharest .

One of the oldest cities ofÂ  Europe , with archeological finds tracing settlements as
early as 6th millennium BC, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Â Belgrade's wider city area was the birthplace of
theÂ  largest prehistoric culture [ 7 ] Â ofÂ  Europe , the VinÄ�a culture . [ 8 ]
Â The city was discovered by theÂ  Greeks , [ 9 ] Â founded and named by theÂ  Celts
Â ( White City , name it still bears), [ 10 ] Â awardedÂ  city rights Â by theÂ 
Romans [ 11 ] Â before it was permanently settled byÂ  White Serbs Â from the 600s
onwards. As a strategic key, the city was battled over in 140 separate wars since the ancient
period by countless armies of theÂ  East Â andÂ  West . [ 12 ] Â In medieval times, it
was in the possession ofÂ  Byzantine ,Â  Frankish ,Â  Bulgarian ,Â  Hungarian
Â andÂ  Serbian Â rulers. In 1521 Belgrade was conquered by theÂ  Ottomans Â and
became the seat of theÂ  Pashaluk of Belgrade , as the principal city of Ottoman Europe [ 13 ]
Â and among the largest European cities. [ 14 ] Â Frequently passing fromÂ  Ottoman
Â toÂ  Austrian rule , the status of Serbian capital would be regained only in 1841, after
theÂ  Serbian revolution . Northern Belgrade , though, remained an Austrian outpost until
the breakup ofÂ  Austria-Hungary Â in 1918. The united city then became the capital of
several incarnations ofÂ  Yugoslavia , up to 2006, when Serbia became an independent state
again.

Belgrade has the status of a separate territorial unit in Serbia, with its own autonomous city
government. [ 15 ] Â Its territory is divided intoÂ  17 municipalities , each having its
own local council. [ 16 ] Â It covers 3.6% of the territory of Serbia, and 24% of the country's
population lives in the city. [ 17 ] Â Belgrade is the central economic hub of Serbia, and the
capital ofÂ  Serbian culture ,Â  education Â and science.

Geography



Belgrade lies 116.75Â metres (383Â ft) above Â  sea level Â and is located atÂ 
confluence Â of theÂ  Danube Â andÂ  Sava Â rivers, atÂ  coordinates
Â 44Â°49'14" North, 20Â°27'44" East. The historical core of Belgrade, today'sÂ 
Kalemegdan , is on the right bank of the rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been
expanding to the south and east, and after World War II,Â  New Belgrade Â was built on the
Sava's left bank, merging Belgrade withÂ  Zemun . Smaller, chiefly residential
communities across the Danube, likeÂ  KrnjaÄ�a Â andÂ  OvÄ�a , also merged
with the city. The city has an urban area of 360Â square kilometres (139Â sqÂ mi),
while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223Â kmÂ²
(1,244.4Â sqÂ mi). Throughout history, Belgrade has been a major crossroad between
theÂ  West Â andÂ  the Orient . [ 18 ]

On the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has hilly terrain, while the highest point of
Belgrade proper isÂ  Torlak hill Â at 303Â m (994Â ft). The mountains ofÂ  Avala
Â (511Â m (1,677Â ft)) andÂ  Kosmaj Â (628Â m (2,060Â ft)) lie south of
the city. [ 19 ] Â Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting ofÂ 
alluvial plains Â andÂ  loessial Â  plateaus .

History



Ancient city



TheÂ  Neolithic Â  StarÄ�evo Â andÂ  VinÄ�a cultures Â existed in or near
Belgrade and dominated theÂ  Balkans Â (as well as parts ofÂ  Central Europe
Â andÂ  Asia Minor ) about 7,000 years ago. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Some scholars believe that the
prehistoricÂ  VinÄ�a signs Â represent the earliest known form ofÂ  alphabet . [
25 ] Â Many centuries later, the GreekÂ  Argonauts Â have discovered the riverÂ 
Sava Â in ancient Belgrade (which they namedÂ  Cauliac ) while sailing from theÂ 
Black Sea Â upstream ( Appolonius ). [ 9 ] Â Settled in the fourth century BC by aÂ 
Celtic Â tribe, theÂ  Scordisci , the city's recorded name was SingidÅ«n, before
becoming theÂ  romanized Â  Singidunum Â in the first century AD. In the mid 2nd
century, the city was proclaimed aÂ  municipium Â by the Roman authorities, evolving
into a full fledgedÂ  colonia Â (highest class Roman city) by the end of the century. [ 11 ]
Â The firstÂ  Christian Â  Emperor of Rome Â was born in modernÂ  Serbia :Â 
Constantine I known asÂ  Constantine the Great Â ( Naissus , 280 A.D. [ 26 ] ) and a Roman
Emperor was born in Belgrade,Â  Jovian , the restorer ofÂ  Christianity ,Â  Flavius
Iovianus , ( Singidunum , 332 A.D. [ 27 ] ) Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official
religion of theÂ  Roman Empire , ending the brief revival of ism under his predecessorÂ 
Julian . In 395Â AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman orÂ  Byzantine Empire . [ 24 ]
Â Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city ofÂ  Taurunum (Zemun) , that
through Roman and Byzantine times shared a common fate with its "twin brother" (the two cities
were connected by a bridge). [ 28 ]

Middle Ages



Singidunum was occupied and often ravaged by successive invasions ofÂ  Huns ,Â 
Sarmatians ,Â  Gepids ,Â  Ostrogoths Â andÂ  Avars Â before the arrival of
theÂ  Slavs Â around 630 AD. It served as the center of the Gepidean Kingdom Â in the
early 500s, before being taken by the Avars. When theÂ  Avars Â were finally destroyed in
the 9th century by theÂ  Frankish Kingdom , it fell back to Byzantine rule, whilstÂ 
Taurunum Â became part of the Frankish realm (and was renamed to Malevilla). [ 29 ] Â At
the same time (around 878), the first record of theÂ  Slavic nameÂ  Beligrad Â has
appeared, during the rule of theÂ  First Bulgarian Empire . For about four centuries, the
city remained a battleground between theÂ  Byzantine Empire , theÂ  Kingdom of Hungary
Â and theÂ  First Bulgarian Empire . [ 30 ] Â The city hosted the armies of theÂ  First
Â and theÂ  Second Crusade ; [ 31 ] Â while passing through during the Third Crusade
,Â  Frederick Barbarossa Â and his 190,000Â  crusaders Â saw Belgrade in ruins. [
32 ] Â Capital of theÂ  Kingdom of Syrmia Â since 1284, the firstÂ  Serbian king
Â to rule over Belgrade wasÂ  Dragutin , who received it as a gift from hisÂ 
father-in-law , the Hungarian kingÂ  Stephen V . [ 33 ] Â Following theÂ  Battle of
Maritsa Â in 1371, and theÂ  Battle of Kosovo Â in 1389, theÂ  Serbian Empire
Â began to crumble as theÂ  Ottoman Empire Â conquered its southern territory. [ 34 ] [
35 ] Â The north, however, resisted through the Serbian Despotate , which had Belgrade as
its capital. The city flourished underÂ  despot Â  Stefan LazareviÄ‡ , son of the
famous Serbian rulerÂ  Lazar HrebeljanoviÄ‡ . LazareviÄ‡ built a castle with a
citadel and towers, of which only theÂ  Despot's tower Â and the west wall remain. He also
refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist the Ottomans for
almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for the many Balkan peoples fleeing
from Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population of some 40â€“50,000. [ 33 ]

In 1427, Stefan's successorÂ  Ä�uraÄ‘ BrankoviÄ‡ Â had to return Belgrade to
theÂ  Hungarians , and the capital was moved toÂ  Smederevo . During his reign, the
Ottomans captured most of theÂ  Serbian Despotate , unsuccessfully besieging Belgrade
first in 1440 [ 31 ] Â and again in 1456. [ 36 ] Â As it presented an obstacle to their further
advance intoÂ  Central Europe , over 100,000 Ottoman solders [ 37 ] Â have launched the
famous Siege of Belgrade , where theÂ  Christian Â army underÂ  John Hunyadi
Â successfully defended the city from the Ottomans, wounding the SultanÂ  Mehmed II [ 38
] Â This battle "decided the fate of Christendom"; [ 39 ] Â theÂ  noon bell Â ordered
byÂ  Pope Callixtus III Â commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to
this day. [ 40 ] [ 31 ]

Turkish conquest / Austrian invasions



It wasn't until August 28, 1521 (7 decades after the last siege), that the fort was finally
captured by SultanÂ  Suleyman the Magnificent Â and his 250,000 soldiers;
subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Christian population
(including Serbs, Hungarians, Greeks, Armenians etc) was deported to Istanbul , [ 31 ] Â to
the area since known as theÂ  Belgrade forest . [ 41 ] Â Belgrade was made the seat of the
district ( Sanjak ), attracting new inhabitantsâ€” Turks , Armenians ,Â  Greeks
,Â  Ragusan Â traders, and others, and there was peace for the next 150 years. The city
became the second largestÂ  Ottoman Â town inÂ  Europe Â at over 100,000 people,
surpassed only byÂ  Constantinople . [ 37 ] Â Turkish rule also introducedÂ  Ottoman
architecture Â to Belgrade and manyÂ  mosques Â were built, increasing the
city'sÂ  Oriental Â influences. [ 42 ] Â In 1594, a majorÂ  Serb rebellion Â was
crushed by the Turks. Further on,Â  Albanian - bornÂ  Grand vizier Â  Sinan Pasha [ 43 ]
ordered theÂ  relics Â ofÂ  Saint Sava Â to be publicly torched on theÂ 
VraÄ�ar plateau ; more recently, theÂ  Temple of Saint Sava Â was built to
commemorate this event. [ 44 ] Â In retaliation for the rebellion, most of the city's
population was deported toÂ  Istanbul ; theÂ  Belgrade Forest Â is, centuries on,
still named after those Serbian refugees. [ 45 ]

Occupied byÂ  Austria Â three times (1688â€“1690, 1717â€“1739,
1789â€“1791), headed by theÂ  Holy Roman Princes Â  Maximilian of Bavaria
Â andÂ  Eugene of Savoy , [ 46 ] Â respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured and
substantially razed each time by the Ottomans. [ 42 ] Â During this period, the city was
affected by the twoÂ  Great Serbian Migrations , in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs,
led by theirÂ  patriarchs , retreated together with the Austrians into the Habsburg
Empire, settling in today'sÂ  Vojvodina Â andÂ  Slavonia . [ 47 ]

Serbian capital



During theÂ  First Serbian Uprising , the Serbian revolutionaries held the city from
January 8, 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. [ 48 ] Â After theÂ  Second
Serbian Uprising Â in 1815, Serbia reached semi-independence, which was formally
recognized by theÂ  Porte Â in 1830. [ 49 ] Â In 1841, PrinceÂ  Mihailo
ObrenoviÄ‡ Â moved the capital fromÂ  Kragujevac Â to Belgrade. [ 50 ] [ 51 ]

With theÂ  Principality 's full independence in 1878, and its transformation into theÂ 
Kingdom of Serbia Â in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and
developed rapidly. [ 48 ] [ 52 ] Â Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia as a whole remained
those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway toÂ  NiÅ¡
, Serbia's second city, and in 1900 the capital had only 69,100 inhabitants. [ 53 ] Â Yet by
1905 the population had grown to more than 80,000, and by the outbreak ofÂ  World War I Â in
1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, not countingÂ  Zemun Â which then belonged
toÂ  Austria-Hungary . [ 54 ]

The first-ever projection of motion pictures in theÂ  Balkans Â andÂ  Central Europe
Â was held in Belgrade in June 1896 by Andre Carr, a representative of the LumiÃšre
brothers . He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have
not been preserved. [ 55 ]

World War I / Unified city

" Kalemegdan Â is the prettiest and most courageous piece of optimism I know. "

â€” Rebecca West Â in 1913 [ 56 ] Gavrilo Princip 'sÂ  assassination of Archduke
Franz Ferdinand Â of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, inÂ  Sarajevo
Â on June 28, 1914 triggeredÂ  World War I . Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives
occurred near Belgrade.Â  Austro-Hungarian Â  monitors Â shelled Belgrade on July
29, 1914, and it was taken by theÂ  Austro-Hungarian Army under GeneralÂ  Oskar Potiorek
Â on November 30. On December 15, it was re-taken byÂ  Serbian troops Â under
MarshalÂ  Radomir Putnik . After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city,
between October 6 and October 9, 1915, Belgrade fell toÂ  German Â and Austro-Hungarian
troops commanded by Field MarshalÂ  August von Mackensen Â on October 9, 1915. The city
was liberated by Serbian andÂ  French troops Â on November 5, 1918, under the command of
MarshalÂ  Louis Franchet d'EspÃ©rey Â ofÂ  France Â andÂ  Crown Prince
Alexander of Serbia . Decimated as the front-line city, for a while it wasÂ  Subotica [ 57 ]
Â that was the largest city in theÂ  Kingdom ; still, Belgrade grew rapidly, retrieving
its position by the early 1920s.

After the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes,
renamed theÂ  Kingdom of Yugoslavia Â in 1929. The Kingdom was split intoÂ  banovinas
, and Belgrade, together withÂ  Zemun Â andÂ  PanÄ�evo , formed a separate
administrative unit. [ 58 ]

During this period, the city experienced faster growth and significant modernisation.
Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (incorporating the town ofÂ  Zemun ,
formerly in Austria-Hungary), and 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921
and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year. [ 59 ] Â In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in
1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. TheÂ  PanÄ�evo Bridge , which
crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935. 60 ]

World War II



On March 25, 1941, the government ofÂ  regent Â  Crown Prince Paul Â signed theÂ 
Tripartite Pact , joining theÂ  Axis powers Â in an effort to stay out of theÂ  Second
World War . This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a militaryÂ  coup
d'Ã©tat Â led by Air Force commander GeneralÂ  DuÅ¡an SimoviÄ‡ , who
proclaimedÂ  King Peter II Â to be of age to rule the realm. Consequently, the city
wasÂ  heavily bombed Â by theÂ  Luftwaffe Â on April 6, 1941, and 24,000 people were
killed.Â  [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Â  YugoslaviaÂ  was thenÂ  invaded Â byÂ  German ,Â 
Italian ,Â  Hungarian , andÂ  Bulgarian Â forces, and suburbs as far east asÂ  Zemun
, in the Belgrade metropolitan area, were incorporated into a NaziÂ  puppet state , theÂ 
Independent State of Croatia . Belgrade became the seat ofÂ  another puppet government ,
headed by GeneralÂ  Milan NediÄ‡ .

During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, Germans carried out
several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of theÂ  Jewish
Â community were subject to mass shootings at the order of GeneralÂ  Franz BÃ¶hme , the
German Military Governor of Serbia. BÃ¶hme rigorously enforced the rule that for every
German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. [ 63 ]

Belgrade was bombed Â by theÂ  Allies Â on April 16 [ citation needed ] , 1944, killing
about 1,600 people. Both this and the earlier Luftwaffe bombing fell on theÂ  Orthodox
Christian Â  Easter . Most of the city remained under German occupation until October 20,
1944, when it was liberated byÂ  Communist Â  Yugoslav Partisans Â and theÂ  Red
Army . On November 29, 1945, MarshalÂ  Josip Broz Tito Â proclaimed the Federal People's
Republic of Yugoslavia Â in Belgrade (later to be renamed toÂ  Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia Â on April 7, 1963).

Communist Yugoslavia



During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia,
developing as a major industrial centre. [ 52 ] Â In 1958, Belgrade's first television
station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference ofÂ  Non-Aligned Countries Â was
held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1968, major student protests against Tito led
to several street clashes between students and the police, ending with Tito's famous saying,
"Students are right!". In March 1972, Belgrade was at the centre ofÂ  the last major
outbreak of smallpox in Europe , which, through enforced quarantine and mass vaccination,
was contained by late May. [ 64 ]

Post-communist history



On March 9, 1991,Â  massive demonstrations Â led byÂ  Vuk DraÅ¡koviÄ‡ Â were
held in the city againstÂ  Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡ . [ 65 ] Â According to various
media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. [ 66 ] Â Two
people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks
were deployed onto the streets to restore order. [ 67 ] Â  Further protests Â were held in
Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged
electoral fraud at local elections. [ 68 ] Â These protests broughtÂ  Zoran
Ä�inÄ‘iÄ‡ Â to power, the firstÂ  mayor of Belgrade Â sinceÂ  World War
II Â who did not belong to theÂ  League of Communists of Yugoslavia Â or its later
offshoot, theÂ  Socialist Party of Serbia . [ 69 ]

TheÂ  NATO bombing Â during theÂ  Kosovo War Â in 1999 caused substantial damage to
the city. Among the sites bombed were the buildings of several ministries, theÂ  RTS
Â building, whichÂ  killed 16 technicians , several hospitals, the Jugoslavija Hotel,
theÂ  Central Committee building , theÂ  Avala TV Tower , and theÂ  Chinese embassy . [
70 ]

After theÂ  elections in 2000 , Belgrade was the site of major street protests, with over
half a million people on the streets (800,000 by police estimates, over 1,000,000 according
toÂ  Misha Glenny ). These demonstrations resulted in theÂ  ousting of president
MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡ . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]

Names through history



Belgrade has had many different names throughout history, and in nearly all languages could
be translated into modern English "white city" (for slavic languages compareÂ  Belgorod ,
a Russian city also called white city). Name Notes SingidÅ«n(o)- Named by the Celtic tribe
of theÂ  Scordisci ;Â  dÅ«n(o)- Â means 'lodgment, enclosure, fort', and for word
'singi' there are several theories - one being that it is a Celtic word for circle, hence "round
fort", and the other that the name originated from the Sings, possibly a Thracian tribe that
occupied the area prior to the arrival of the Scordisci. [ 73 ] SingidÅ«num Romans conquered

(8,372), andÂ  Muslims by nationality Â (4,617). [ 77 ] Â Recent polls (2007) show

79 ] Â The official estimate for the end of 2007, according to the City's Institute for
Informatics and Statistics, was 1,630,000. [ 3 ]

Belgrade is home to many ethnicities from all over the former Yugoslavia. [ 2 ] Â Many people
came to the city as economic migrants from smaller towns and the countryside, while thousands
arrived as refugees fromÂ  Croatia ,Â  Bosnia-Herzegovina Â andÂ  Kosovo , as a
result of theÂ  Yugoslav wars Â of the 1990s. [ 80 ] Â Between 10,000 and 20,000Â  [ 81
] Â  Chinese Â are estimated to live in Belgrade; they began immigrating in theÂ 
mid-1990s .Â  Blok 70 Â inÂ  New Belgrade Â is known locally as the Chinese quarter.
[ 82 ] [ 83 ] Â Belgrade is also reported to have many IndonesianÂ  Indonesian
Â people.Â  [ 84 ] Â ManyÂ  Middle Easterners , mainly fromÂ  Syria ,Â  Iran ,
Jordan Â andÂ  Iraq , arrived in order to pursue their studies during the 1970s and 1980s,
and have remained and started families in the city. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] Â Afghani and Iraqi Kurdish
refugees are among some of the recent arrivals from the Middle East. [ 87 ]

The troubled transition from theÂ  former Yugoslavia Â to theÂ  Federal Republic
Â during the early 1990s left Belgrade, like the rest of the country, severely affected by
an internationally imposedÂ  trade embargo . TheÂ  hyperinflation Â of theÂ 
Yugoslav dinar , the highest inflation ever recorded in the world, [ 91 ] [ 92 ] Â decimated
the city's economy. Yugoslavia overcame the problems of inflation in the mid 1990s, and
Belgrade has been growing strongly ever since. Today, over 30% of Serbia'sÂ  GDP Â is
generated by the city, which also has over 30% of Serbia's employed population. [ 93 ] Â The
average monthly income per capita is 47.500 RSD (â‚¬572, $903). According to theÂ 
Eurostat Â methodology, and contrasting sharply to the Balkan region, 53% of the city's
households own a computer. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Â According to the same survey, 39.1% of Belgrade's
households have an internet connection; these figures are above those of the regional
capitals such asÂ  Sofia ,Â  Bucharest Â andÂ  Athens . [ 94 ]

than 25,000 military exhibits dating as far back as to theÂ  Roman period , as well as parts of
aÂ  F-117 Â stealth aircraft shot down by Yugoslav forces. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Â TheÂ 
Museum of Aviation in Belgrade Â has more than 200 aircraft, of which about 50 are on
display, and a few of which are the only surviving examples of their type, such as theÂ  Fiat
G.50 . This museum also displays parts of shot downÂ  US Â andÂ  NATO Â aircraft,
such as theÂ  F117 Â andÂ  F16 [ 108 ] Â TheÂ  Ethnographic Museum , established in
1901, contains more than 150,000 items showcasing the rural and urban culture of the Balkans,
particularly the countries of theÂ  former Yugoslavia . [ 109 ] Â TheÂ  Museum of
Contemporary Art Â has a collection of around 8,540 works of art produced inÂ 
Yugoslavia since 1900. [ 110 ] Â TheÂ  Nikola Tesla Museum , founded in 1952, preserves

Architecture



Belgrade has wildly varyingÂ  architecture , from the centre ofÂ  Zemun , typical of
aÂ  Central European Â town, [ 116 ] Â to the more modern architecture and spacious
layout ofÂ  New Belgrade . The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan park. Outside of
Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from 19th century, due to its geographic position
and frequent wars and destructions. [ 117 ] Â The oldest public structure in Belgrade is a
nondescript TurkishÂ  turbe , while the oldest house is a modest clay house onÂ 
DorÄ‡ol , from late 18th century. [ 118 ] Â Western influence began in the 19th century,
when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture
of the time, with influences fromÂ  neoclassicism ,Â  romanticism Â andÂ 
academic art . Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the
late 19th century, producing theÂ  National Theatre ,Â  Old Palace ,Â  Cathedral
Church Â and later, in the early 20th century, theÂ  National Assembly Â andÂ 
National Museum , influenced byÂ  art nouveau . [ 117 ] Â Elements ofÂ  Neo-Byzantine
architecture Â are present in buildings such asÂ  Vuk's Foundation , old Post Office in
Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such asÂ  St. Mark's Church Â (based on
theÂ  GraÄ�anica monastery ), and theÂ  Temple of Saint Sava . [ 117 ]

During the period of Communist rule, much housing was built quickly and cheaply to house the
huge influx of people from the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in
theÂ  brutalist architecture Â of the blokovi Â (blocks) of New Belgrade; aÂ 
socrealism Â trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like theÂ  Trade Union Hall . [
117 ] Â However, in the mid-1950s, theÂ  modernist Â trends took over, and still
dominate the Belgrade architecture. [ 117 ]

Tourism



The historic areas and buildings of Belgrade are among the city's premier attractions. They
includeÂ  Skadarlija , theÂ  National Museum Â and adjacentÂ  National Theatre
,Â  Zemun ,Â  Nikola PaÅ¡iÄ‡ Square ,Â  Terazije ,Â  Students' Square ,
theÂ  Kalemegdan Fortress ,Â  Knez Mihailova Street , theÂ  Parliament , theÂ 
Temple of Saint Sava , and theÂ  Old Palace . On top of this, there are many parks, monuments,
museums, cafÃ©s, restaurants and shops on both sides of the river. The hilltopÂ  Avala
Monument Â offers views over the city.Â  Josip Broz Tito 's mausoleum, calledÂ 
KuÄ‡a CveÄ‡a Â ( The House of Flowers ), and the nearbyÂ  TopÄ�ider
Â andÂ  KoÅ¡utnjak Â parks are also popular, especially among visitors from
theÂ  former Yugoslavia .

Â ,open for visitors. The palace has many valuable works fromÂ  Rembrandt ,Â  Nicolas
Poussin , Sebastien Bourdon ,Â  Paolo Veronese ,Â  Antonio Canaletto ,Â  Biagio
d'Antonio ,Â  Giuseppe Crespi ,Â  Franz Xaver Winterhalter ,Â  Ivan Mestrovic , and
others. 'White Palace' is open for visitors.

Ada Ciganlija Â is a former island on theÂ  Sava river , and Belgrade's biggest sports and
recreational complex. Today it is connected with the shore, creating an artificial lake on
the river. It is the most popular destination for Belgraders during the city's hot summers.
There are 7 kilometres of long beaches and sports facilities for various sports
includingÂ  golf ,Â  football ,Â  basketball ,Â  volleyball ,Â  rugby union
,Â  baseball , andÂ  tennis . [ 119 ] Â During summer there are between 200,000 and
300,000 bathers daily. Clubs work 24 hours a day, organising live music and overnight beach
parties. Extreme sports are available, such asÂ  bungee jumping ,Â  water skiing
Â andÂ  paintballing . [ 120 ] Â There are numerous tracks on the island, where it is
possible to ride a bike, go for a walk or go jogging. [ 121 ] [ 122 ] Â Apart from Ada, Belgrade
has total of 16 islands [ 123 ] Â on the rivers, many still unused. Among them, theÂ  Great
War Island Â at the confluence of Sava, stands out as an oasis of unshattered wildlife
(especially birds). [ 124 ] Â These areas, along with nearbyÂ  Small War Island , are
protected by the city's government as aÂ  nature preserve . [ 125 ]

Nightlife



Belgrade has a reputation for offering a vibrant nightlife, and many clubs that are open until
dawn can be found throughout the city. The most recognizable nightlife features of Belgrade
are the barges ( splavovi ) spread along the banks of the Sava and Danube Rivers. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [
128 ]

Many weekend visitorsâ€”particularly fromÂ  Bosnia-Herzegovina ,Â  Croatia
Â andÂ  Slovenia â€”prefer Belgrade nightlife to that of their own capitals, due
to a perceived friendly atmosphere, great clubs and bars, cheap drinks, the lack of language
difficulties, and the lack of restrictive night life regulation. [ 129 ] [ 130 ]

Famous alternative clubs include Akademija and the famed KST ( Klub studenata tehnike )
located in the basement of theÂ  University of Belgrade 's Faculty of Electrical
Engineering. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] [ 133 ] Â One of the most famous sites for alternative cultural
happenings in the city is the SKC (Student Cultural Centre), located right across from
Belgrade's highrise landmark, theÂ  BeograÄ‘anka . Concerts featuring famous local
and foreign bands are often held at the centre. SKC is also the site of various art exhibitions,
as well as public debates and discussions. [ 134 ]

A more traditional Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known
asÂ  Starogradska Â (roughly translated asÂ  Old Town Music ), typical of northern
Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija , the city's oldÂ  bohemian
Â neighbourhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade gathered in the nineteenth
century and early twentieth century. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the
surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional
restaurants (calledÂ  kafanas Â in Serbian), which date back to that period. [ 135 ]
Â At one end of the neighborhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded in the
first half of the nineteenth century. [ 136 ] Â One of the city's oldest kafanas is theÂ 
Znak pitanja . [ 137 ]

major sporting events recently, including Eurobasket 2005 , theÂ  2005 European
Volleyball Championship , the 2006Â  European Water Polo Championship , and theÂ 
European Youth Olympic Festival Â 2007. Belgrade will be the host city of theÂ  2009

theÂ  1992 Summer Olympics Â Belgrade was eliminated in the third round ofÂ 
International Olympic Committee Â voting, with the games going toÂ  Barcelona .
TheÂ  1996 Summer Olympics Â ultimately went toÂ  Atlanta . [ 141 ] [ 142 ]

The city is home to Serbia's two biggest and most successfulÂ  football Â clubs,Â  Red
Star Belgrade Â andÂ  FK Partizan , as well as a few other first league clubs. The two major
stadiums in Belgrade are theÂ  Marakana ( Red Star Stadium ) and theÂ  Partizan Stadium . [
143 ] Â  Belgrade Arena Â is used for basketball matches, and in May 2008 it was the venue
ofÂ  Eurovision Song Contest 2008 . Along withÂ  Pionir Hall Â forÂ  KK Partizan
Â andÂ  KK Crvena zvezda . [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Â while theÂ  TaÅ¡majdan Sports Centre
Â is used forÂ  water polo Â matches.



Media



Belgrade is the most important media hub in Serbia. The city is home to the main headquarters of
the national broadcasterÂ  Radio Television Serbia - RTS , which is a public service
broadcaster. [ 146 ] Â The RTS record label, PGP RTS, is also based in Belgrade. [ 147 ]
Â The most popular commercial broadcaster isÂ  RTV Pink , a Serbian media
multinational, known for its popular entertainment programs, which are considered by many
to be sensationalist and of low quality. The most popular commercial "alternative"
broadcaster isÂ  B92 , another media company, which has its own TV station, radio station,
and music and book publishing arms, as well as the most popular website on the Serbian
internet. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Â Other TV stations broadcasting from Belgrade includeÂ 
KoÅ¡ava ,Â  Avala ,Â  FOX Televizija Â and others which only cover the greater
Belgrade municipal area, such asÂ  Studio B . Numerous specialised channels are also
available:Â  SOS channel Â (sport),Â  Metropolis Â (music),Â  Art TV
Â (art), Cinemania (film), andÂ  Happy TV Â (children's programs).

High-circulation daily newspapers published in Belgrade includeÂ  Politika ,Â  Blic
,Â  VeÄ�ernje novosti ,Â  Glas javnosti ,Â  Press (newspaper) Â andÂ 
Sportski ÅŸurnal . Other dailies published in the city areÂ  Danas , andÂ  Kurir .Â 
Novi Plamen Â is currently the most left-wing magazine. A new free distribution
daily,Â  24 sata , was founded in the autumn of 2006.

Education

Belgrade has two state universities and several private institutions for higher education.
TheÂ  Belgrade Higher School , founded in 1808, was the earliest location of higher
education in Serbia and all of theÂ  Balkans . [ 150 ] Â TheÂ  Lyceum Â followed in
1841, when it was moved fromÂ  Kragujevac Â to Belgrade, merging with theÂ  Great
School Â into the precursor of theÂ  University of Belgrade , [ 151 ] Â one of the oldest
educational institutions in the country (the oldest higher education facility, the
Teacher's College inÂ  Subotica , dates from 1689). More than 90,000 students study at the
University. [ 152 ] Â TheÂ  University of Belgrade's Law School Â is the one of the
foremost institutions for legal education inÂ  Southeastern Europe .

There are also 195 primary (elementary) schools and 85 secondary schools. Of the primary
schools, there are 162 regular, 14 special, 15 art and 4 adult schools. The secondary school
system has 51 vocational schools, 21 gymnasiums, 8 art schools and 5 special schools. The
230,000 pupils are managed by 22,000 employees in over 500 buildings, covering around
1,100,000Â mÂ². [ 153 ]

Transportation



Belgrade has an extensive public transport system based onÂ  buses Â (118 urban lines
and more than 300 suburban lines),Â  trams Â (12 lines), andÂ  trolley buses Â (8
lines). [ 154 ] Â It is run byÂ  GSP Beograd Â andÂ  SP Lasta , in cooperation with
private companies on various bus routes. Belgrade also has aÂ  commuter rail
Â network,Â  Beovoz , now run by city government. The main railway station connects
Belgrade with other European capitals and many towns in Serbia. Travel byÂ  coach Â is
also popular, and the capital is well-served with daily connections to every town in the
country. TheÂ  motorway Â system provides for easy access toÂ  Novi Sad Â andÂ 
Budapest , the capital ofÂ  Hungary , in the north;Â  NiÅ¡ Â to the south; andÂ 
Zagreb , to the west. Situated at the confluence of two major rivers, the Danube and the Sava,
Belgrade has not many bridgesâ€”the two main ones areÂ  Branko's bridge Â andÂ 
Gazela , both of which connect the core of the city toÂ  New Belgrade . NewÂ  Ada Bridge
Â is currently under construction.

TheÂ  Port of Belgrade Â is on the Danube, and allows the city to receive goods by river. [
155 ] Â The city is also served byÂ  Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport ( IATA : BEG),
12Â kilometres west of the city centre, nearÂ  SurÄ�in . At its peak in 1986, almost 3
million passengers travelled through the airport, though that number dwindled to a trickle
in the 1990s. [ 156 ] Â Following renewed growth in 2000, the number of passengers reached
approximately 2 million in 2004 and 2005. [ 157 ] Â In 2006, 2 million passengers passed
through the airport by mid-November, [ 158 ] Â while during the 2007 the figure peaked at 2,5
million customers. [ 159 ]

With the city's expansion and a substantial increase in the number of vehicles, congestion
has become a major problem; this is expected to be alleviated by the construction of aÂ 
bypass Â connecting theÂ  E70 Â andÂ  E75 Â highways. [ 160 ] Â Further, an
"inner magistral semi-ring" is planned, including a new bridge across the Sava river, which
is expected to easeÂ  commuting Â within the city and unload the Gazela and Branko's
bridge. [ 161 ] Â Belgrade is going to start the construction of three new bridges in 2008,
one over theÂ  Sava Â river, and two over theÂ  Danube Â river. Two additional
bridges are planned, both over the Danube.

Beovoz
