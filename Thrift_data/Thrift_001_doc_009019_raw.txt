Fans of Check Please! , the show that lets every day people review their favorite Chicago area
restaurant, will be happy to know that the host Alpana Singh is opening a wine bar in River North
.Â  No word of exact location or estimated opening date but I will be on the look out for more
updates.Â  In my opinion there can never be enough good wine bars.

Fast Food Quest – BIG & little’s Near North Side

21 Oct

Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/big-littles-outside.jpg?w=490&h=656

12/5/11 Update: BIG &Â  little’s has moved to 860 N Orleans St,Â  Chicago, IL

I heard that Chick-fil-A opened in Chicago and it got me thinking about fast food. I remember
liking it back in the day but would I like it now? It’s like when you have a favorite movie from
your teenage years and you go back and watch as an adult and are so disappointed because it’s
really bad and not bad enough to be good, just really bad. I am rambling but in between thinking
about going to Chick-fil-A and missing In-N-Out BurgerÂ  Â  my friend April suggested we
check outÂ  BIG & little\’s in River North/Near North Side.

It is a tiny place with about 10 counter spaces to sit. Seems the majority of people take the food
to-go. Parking isn’t the easiest now since they are redoing the street and it’s in a part of
town that is probably not on your usual path if you are walking around the Near North side.Â 
Stepping inside you are immediately hit with the smell of seafood being fried and burgers
being cooked — it was a great. Reggae music was playing and it made me feel like, “where are
we??” It was a good feeling though, nice to be out of a comfort zone as they say and have a new
experience.

Chef Gary Strauss welcomed us and gave us some recommendations. He didn’t mind me taking
pictures and had a very laid-back vibe. We went with the Whitefish Po Boy and truffle fries.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/big-littles-to-go.jpg?w=490&h=656

While waiting for the food I noticed BIG & little’s has won a few awards for cheap eats and chef
Tony was on the reality show Hell\’s Kitchen. Â  Also they will be on the TV show Diners,
Drive-Ins & Dives on Monday November 7th.Â  All really great, but not as great as the smell of
the truffle fries when I opened the to go bag (pictured above). I had to dig right in instead of
waiting until we got home. These were some of the best fries I have ever had. Crispy on the
outside and soft on the inside and perfectly fresh. No ketchup needed, in fact it takes away
from the fry. YOU NEED TO EAT THESE FRIES.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/big-littles-truffle-fries.jpg?w=490&h=367

The White Fish Po Boy was huge, can be split even if you have a healthy appetite. I’m not the
biggest fan of fried fish but this sandwich did not feel too heavy or greasy. There was a bit of
spice to the sauce and the bread was fresh. I recommend eating the food there (if there is room)
since it does lose a bit of the crispness over time. The fries were still great but by the time we
were home there was difference.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/white-fish-po-boy-e1319218359240.jpg?w=490&h=312

I will be back, for the fries obviously but to try their fish tacos. I’ve heard they have some
of the best Fish & Chips around. So if you are looking for seafood (or burgers/fries) and
don’t feel like a sit down place likeÂ  GT Fish & Oyster or Shaw\’s Crab House come here.
Especially if you work in River North and want something new or need a snack break when you’re
shopping downtown. Oh, it is cash only. BIG & little’s – 939 N Orleans, Chicago, IL 60610

I Ate Alligator | Union Sushi + Barbeque – River North

8 Sep



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/union-bbq-skewers-e1315500654407.jpg?w=490&h=292

I didn’t plan on it, it just happened one night in River North .Â So began my meal atÂ 
Union Sushi +Â Barbeque . Seems to be the “it” thing this year in Chicago , sushi & BBQ .
Â Said alligator is pictured above on the right-hand side. Looks harmless, doesn’t it?
Someone asked me if it was crispy, it was not. It had the consistency of chicken just a bit
heartier tasting. I did go backÂ and ordered the alligator again and they were out so it must
be popular. My recommendation is to try it. It won’t hurt and the portion is so small you
don’t have to commit to a full appetizer or entrÃ©e and you can feel adventurous.

From left to right:

PROSCIUTTO-WRAPPED SCALLOP |Â wasabi-avocado purÃ©e, sweet plum sauce, fried ginger
– Very tasty and the most interesting item from the barbequeÂ bar to me (including the
alligator). Plum sauce and ginger were a good complement to the scallop.

CHICKEN THIGH |Â Japanese-curry – Good flavor but with so many other items on the menu I
wouldn’t order again.

BEEF FILET |Â ginger-soy – I did not try this but my meat-loving dining partner really
liked it.

ALLIGATOR |Â garlic-soy + Kirin Light Â - You should try it just to try it. Heartier like a
venison but not strong flavor.

WHOLE SQUID |Â tare-soy – Pictured below. I did not try it but was told it was good and it
would be a repeat order.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/union-sushi-whole-squid-e1315502337288.jpg?w=490&h=204

Having the BBQ part out-of-the-way I moved on to the sushi/seafood. First up was the truffled
tuna withÂ truffle oil, avocado, parmesan, chile fresco + wonton chips. For some reason I
couldn’t initially taste the truffle oil but once I did it made the dish worth ordering.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/union-bbq-truffled-tuna.jpg?w=490&h=326

Next:Â OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL |Â (6) red tobiko, green onion, crispy shallot +
jalapeno-cilantro ponzu. I’m not a huge oyster eater but the flavor combination was great.
The green onion with the texture of the crispy shallot was really good. Bold but in a delicate
way…if that makes any sense. These were ordered again on the second visit.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/union-bbq-oysters.jpg?w=490&h=326

The Union Rolls look a lot more interesting than the classic rolls so we went for those and were
not disappointed. You can order half-orders of all the rolls so it makes it easier to try more at
one time.

OLD CITY MARKET |Â spicy tuna, seared salmon, spicy ponzu, cilantro, green onion, fried
okra + wrapped in collard green . I really like the collard green wrap. The fish tasted fresh and
did not seem hidden behind all the flavors. It was ordered on the second visit.

THE BELLY ROLL |Â hamachi, cucumber, orange tobiko, scallion, chili paste aioli, crispy
tempura crumbs, fried pork belly strips + eel sauce. I loved this roll, yes there is pork belly
on top and it seems weird but it worked. Another repeat order.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/union-bbq-market-belly-rolls.jpg?w=490&h=326

Besides the rolls my next favorite thing about Union Sushi + Barbeque Â were the craft
cocktails.

THE SPARROW BEE |Â El Dorado 5 year Rum, Lemon, Honey Syrup, Mint, Bittercube Jamaican #2
Bitters. This is the type of drink that if you are not careful you finish it in no time. Not
because you want a buzz but because you don’t want the perfect taste to end. When you take the
first sip and your eyes get bigger and you say, “Oh my god, this is so good, you have to try
it.” Then the person with you is bummed because your drink is so much better.

http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/union-bbq-the-sparrow-bee-e1315505074651.jpg?w=490&h=445

That is unless you ordered theÂ NIGHT SCENE |Â  Sobieski Vodka , Rock Sake, Cocchi
Americano, Combier Orange Liqueur, Bittercube Orange Bitters. Â Another perfectly
balanced drink and deceptively strong as the vodka is hardly tasted.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/union-bbq-night-scene.jpg?w=490&h=735

I did get a dessert but don’t necessarily recommend it. Tasted like prepackaged
dessert:Â KILLER YUZU PIE |Â coconut biscuit crust, fresh whipped cream

Before the rolls and cocktails, my favorite thing about Union Sushi + BBQ is the space itself.
It is nice and open, visually interesting and the music is great. The atmosphere makes it hard
to leave and miss going to Up Bar that is you guessed it, upstairs to continue the night.

Lunchtime at GT Fish and Oyster

15 Aug

Open for about four months, GT Fish and Oyster Â took overÂ the space that used to house
Tizi Melloul and changed it into a Â bright and open restaurant. Sunshine was streaming
through the windows and the vibe was relaxed. The music lent to the ambience,Â  Neil Young
‘s Harvest Moon,Â  Mumford & Sons Â and Ray LaMontagne . From what I have heard, this is
opposite of the feel at nighttime, crowded, loud and more like a scene.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/gt-fish-oyster.jpg?w=490&h=490

Here’s the lunch breakdown:

Tuna Poke: mango, cucumber, black sesame. Fresh and good flavors. The mango keeps this dish
from tasting like the standard poke.

Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/gt-fish-oyster-tuna-poke.jpg?w=490&h=367

Tuna Poke

Oysters served with Ponzu Mignonette and GT Cocktail Sauce: 3 Pebble Beach (West,
Washington) and 3 Kusshi (West, British Columbia ). I’m not an oyster expert but I did like
the Pebble Beach oyster, tasted like the sea. I did not try the Kusshi but my friend really liked
both and he knows his oysters.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/gt-fish-oysters-e1313337193140.jpg?w=490&h=373

Fish Taco: Rockfish, chipotle aioli, chicharron, garlic, pea shoots. Perfect size and great
flavor combination. Pea shoots added a nice dimension and balanced the aioli.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/fish-taco.jpg?w=490&h=367

Tuna BLT: seared tuna, bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, aioli. Served with Fried Pickles .
This was my favorite dish of the meal. The tuna was seared perfectly, sourdough bread was
fresh, avocado/bacon/aoili and tomato together, delicious.

http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/gt-fish-tuna-blt-side-e1313338741662.jpg?w=490&h=432

The best fried pickles I’ve had north of the Mason Dixon Line Â and no dipping sauce
needed.

I would recommend GT Fish and Oyster for a nice lunch with a friend/date or a business lunch. It
also sounds like it could be fun for a night out if you are up for it. HighÂ quality
ingredients and excellent service, however, this is also reflected in the price. GT Fish and
Oyster Â is onÂ 531 N Wells St,Â  Chicago,Â IL Â 60654.

Roka Akor Chicago – One of the Top 10 New Sushi Spots in the Country?

2 Aug

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Salmon_Nigiri_Sushi_with_chopsticks%2C_2008.jpg/300px-Salmon_Nigiri_Sushi_with_chopsticks%2C_2008.jpg

Image via Wikipedia

A couple of weeks ago I was downtown near River North and had a craving for sushi. It was Sunday
around 6pm so any of the normal lunch sushi places that come to mind were not open. I have been
wanting to try a place up north but my appetite wasn’t having it so thought, Sunda. I know what
I am getting, I like it and it won’t be crazy crowded. Walking there I looked across the street
and noticed a restaurant that I had never seen before.

I crossed the street to check it out and noticed it was huge, easily over 5,000-square-feet.
The design drew me in enough to pique my curiosity and look at the menu. Once stepping inside it
was decided, why not try a new spot? After chatting with the waiter I learned that Roka Akor
Â is a chain but not with the “bad” connotations that chain restaurants can have.
Â In fact,Â  Bon Appetit lists this asÂ one of theÂ  Top 10 Sushi Spots .

I guess I came at the right time as there was not wait and the restaurant was not crowded as I’ve
read it has been after it opened. I am glad that I came in not having any expectations or knowing
the history of the restaurant. Having been open for less than two weeks you could tell the
staff, although well-trained, was still getting a feel for the service they were presenting.
I am one that does not necessarily “require” the wait staff to be hyper attentive. It’s
okay if my water-glass is half-full or my plate not cleared the second I am finished. Someone
was there the second after I finished or had less than “enough” water. It wasn’t
annoying just noticeable and I do know that there are a lot of people who like their service this
way. This really would be my only complaint and it really isn’t even that, more an
observation.

Along with sushi Roka Akor is known for its robata grill. The second half of the menu is
dedicated to grilled items.

The drink menu is extensive and by extensive I mean about 45 pages. Sake, wine, cocktails and
beer. I had the Blood Orange Margarita. It was delicious. Any drink that uses fresh juice is
automatically going to be good and the chili salt/sugar rim was a great finisher to the drink.



Image:
http://aliciatasteslife.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/roka-akor_blood-orange-margarita_july-11.jpg?w=224&h=300

Dinner:

Wagyu Beef Kimchi Dumplings – Very tasty. Kimchi was just the right bitterness for the rich
Wagyu

Maki Roll,Â Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll – One of the rolls that was further way from the
traditional rolls you see on every menu. The chili on top was just enough for a kick but not
overpowering.

Prime Skirt Steak (8 oz.) with Sweet Garlic Soy – The flavor and texture were the best I have
tasted in a while in Chicago .

Salmon Nigiri – Very fresh, the melt in your mouth fresh that seems to be hit-or-miss in
Chicago.

Dessert – Chocolate cake with roasted coffee beans and coffee ice-cream

Overall I would recommend this place for those that want an alternative to Sunda, have both
sushi and steak eaters and don’t mind spending some money.Â I would like to see how the
lounge/bar area of the restaurant pans out, will it be a cool place to hang out and they will
throw a dj in there or just a place to wait before dinner? Â The music they played in the dining
room was very modern and even had some hip-hop thrown in. Menu is extensive so you can go back
again and again and work your way through it. Good for a date or dinner with friends but for me,
not for your everyday. I don’t think Roka Akor is top 10 but does rank highly with solid sushi.

P.S. Since this was an impromptu outing I did not have a good camera with me so the pictures are a
bit off as I used my phone.
