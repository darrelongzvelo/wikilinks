Weekend Wings #28: The Balikpapan Raid



The US Army Air Force carried out many notable bombing attacks in World War II. In the European
theater of operations, they included the infamous Schweinfurt-Regensburg missions;
Operation Tidal Wave , the raid on the Ploesti oilfields in Rumania; Operation Frantic Joe ,
the first of the so-called 'shuttle bombing' raids, where US bombers flew from English and
Italian bases to airfields in the Ukraine, bombing the Debreczen marshalling yards en route,
then were refuelled and rearmed to bomb more targets on their return flights; and its
participation in the controversial destruction of Dresden in 1945.



In the Pacific theater, the incendiary raids on Japan by B-29 Superfortresses during 1945
produced a holocaust of destruction. During a single incendiary raid on Tokyo on 10th March
1945, Operation Meetinghouse , the resulting firestorm destroyed sixteen square miles of
the city, killing between 80,000 and 100,000 people (more than were killed in either
Hiroshima or Nagasaki by the initial explosions of the atomic bombs dropped on those cities),
and rendering over one million residents homeless.



Such major raids are well-known. What isn't so well known are the countless missions flown
against lesser targets, particularly in the Pacific war. The B-29 raids on Japan from the
Marianas seem to have garnered most of the post-war attention of authors and film-makers. The
vast number of raids by other types of aircraft, on other targets, appear to have been largely
forgotten.



This Weekend Wings seeks to remedy that by examining one particularly daring, dangerous and
difficult air raid during the Pacific war. It was launched on September 30th, 1944, against
the oil refineries at Balikpapan , in what was then the Dutch East Indies and is today
Indonesia. These refineries were estimated to be supplying Japan with up to 35% of her refined
petroleum products, and well over half those used by her forces in the Philippines. Their
destruction would be a body blow to the Japanese war machine, and (hopefully) make the
invasion of the Philippines (which began twenty days after the raid) much easier.



However, there were immense difficulties to be overcome before they could be attacked. For a
start, the distances in the Pacific war were of monumental proportions, far longer than in the
European theater of operations. Balikpapan only came within extreme range of the B-24
Liberator bombers of the 13th and 5th US Air Forces when the island of Noemfoor (part of what are
today the Biak Islands of Indonesia, near the northern tip of Papua New Guinea) was captured in
Operation Table Tennis . (Click the map, and all images, for a larger view.)

The island is so tiny that on a large-scale map of the Pacific theater of operations, it's too
small to be visible. Task Force Cyclone landed there on July 2nd, 1944, and combat operations
continued until the end of August.

The fighting on Noemfoor was vicious, with incidents of cannibalism recorded among the
Japanese defenders when their supplies ran out. Also notable was a parachute assault by the
503rd Parachute Infantry Regimental Combat Team, which resulted in high jump casualties.

According to the US Army's official history of the Noemfoor operation : "By 31 August ... the
CYCLONE Task Force had lost 63 men killed, 343 wounded, and 3 missing. Approximately 1,730
Japanese had been killed and 186 were captured ... In addition to the Japanese losses, 1
Korean, 1 Chinese, and 552 Formosan prisoners of war were taken. Finally, 403 Javanese slave
laborers were recovered on the island." Most of about 4,000 laborers, brought by the Japanese
from Java and Taiwan, had apparently died under Japanese maltreatment before the invasion.
The indigenous people of Noemfoor had hidden from the Japanese in the interior of the island,
and emerged from the jungle to greet the US forces as liberators.

There were three airfields on Noemfoor, all built by the Japanese. Australian engineers of 62
Works Wing began a frantic, all-out effort to upgrade them, and particularly to prepare the
airstrip at Kornasoren to support fighter and B-24 bomber operations, even before the
fighting had ended. An account of their experiences may be found here . By September 2nd, two
parallel 7,000-foot runways had been completed, and the bombers moved in. This put them
within extreme - very extreme! - range of the refineries at Balikpapan.



The return flight between Noemfoor Island and Balikpapan would be just over 2,500 miles -
comparable to flying from New York City, NY to Key West, FL and back, or, in Europe, from London,
England to Saint Petersburg in Russia and back (three times as far as a typical
England-to-Germany-and-back bombing mission in the European theater of operations). This
meant that no fighter escort would be possible, as no escort aircraft had the necessary range.



Almost every one of those 2,500 miles would be over enemy-controlled territory or ocean. The
B-24's would thus have to carry a full load of ammunition, weighing 1½ tons, for their ten
defensive .50-caliber machine-guns. They also needed to carry 1½ tons of bombs (six
500-pound or twelve 250-pound), in order to do sufficient damage to the refineries. Together
with crew, guns and other equipment, this came to over 5 tons of weight, even before beginning
to consider how much fuel would be required.

The original B-24A model, which entered service in 1941, was rated for a maximum takeoff
weight of 53,600 pounds. This was improved in subsequent models: the B-24J, used on the
Balikpapan raids, was rated for 65,000 pounds. The B-24's maximum range using standard fuel
tanks was 2,850 miles, but that was in ferry configuration, without bombs or other heavy
material. To carry their bombs, guns, ammunition, and enough fuel to get to Balikpapan and
back (which would require the use of a reserve fuel tank mounted in the bomb bay), they'd be
dangerously overloaded.



The squadron engineers sat down, figured out the fuel load, and used language described by an
interested (and admiring) Australian observer as "rather unfortunate, really!" The total
aircraft weight worked out to almost 70,000 pounds - 2½ tons over the B-24J's maximum rated
takeoff weight! In addition, the aircraft's center of gravity would be grossly distorted by
so heavy a load - so much so that it might be unflyable. Clearly, something had to be done.







Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kIWY2DV0KnE/STIjhcJXXLI/AAAAAAAABzE/m5MW5qnEWyc/s400/B-24J+Liberator.jpg



First, the crews went over their bombers, looking for any equipment that was not absolutely
necessary for the mission. They found a lot. Bomb hoists, extra bomb shackles, radio tuning
meters, toolkits, personal possessions - all of it came out. After removing everything they
thought they could spare, the total aircraft weight had come down to 68,500 pounds. They'd
saved over half a ton in weight.



Next, the crews called in the civilian representatives of Consolidated Aircraft, makers of
the B-24. The US Army Air Force had expanded so fast that it wasn't able to train all of the
mechanics and technical experts it needed to service its warplanes. As a result, every US
aircraft manufacturer assigned their own technical specialists to the war zones, to work
with uniformed personnel and teach them how to maintain their aircraft. Fortunately, some
B-24 specialists were available.







Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/B-24_from_above.jpg



They did some intricate calculations, and determined that the aircraft's center of gravity
would be so drastically affected by such an overload that the normal methods of trimming it in
flight would be unworkable. Instead, they drew up a special series of instructions, taking
into account the aircraft's weight during each hour of the flight and the changing conditions
en route . Each member of the crew was given a special place in the aircraft where his gear -
parachute, emergency ration belt, medical kit, flak suit, helmet - would be stowed. Even the
men themselves were given new positions for the first few hours, redistributing their weight
to help the pilot maintain stability. They would not go to their normal stations until the time
for action approached.



(This caused much muttering among the gunners, who didn't fancy allowing Japanese fighters
an unopposed run at their aircraft. They were informed during briefing that they needn't
worry, because their aircraft would depart at night, when Japanese fighter pilots would be
asleep. The aforementioned Australian observer reports that one gunner stood up and
retorted, "Yeah, and it'll be just my lousy luck to meet the only ******* fighter pilot in the
whole ******* Japanese air force with ******* insomnia!" This reportedly brought the house
down.)

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kIWY2DV0KnE/STIkNO__YeI/AAAAAAAABzM/wBRECiYNRxY/s400/B-24D+Liberator.jpg



These drastic measures enabled the specialists to establish a center of gravity that would
allow the aircraft to take off safely. However, their weight would diminish greatly over the
course of the mission, so the center of gravity would shift during the flight. Therefore, the
crew were given instructions to move certain items of heavy equipment, and take up new
positions themselves, at regular intervals, to keep the aircraft as stable and controllable
as possible. By the time they approached Balikpapan, enough weight would have been burned off
(in the form of fuel) to restore the aircraft to normal flying condition.



Next, the specialists worked out the most economical power settings for the engines, to
minimize fuel consumption. They conducted several experimental flights, trying various
alternatives, and to their surprise found that a heavily overloaded B-24 could fly slightly
faster with five degrees of flap down than with the flaps retracted, as would normally be the
case. They settled on a speed of 150 mph for the outward trip, and recommended power settings
for takeoff, climb, cruising, approaching the target, breakaway, descent and the homeward
journey. Each setting allowed for the changing weight and center of gravity of the aircraft.



The specialists ensured that all the bombers which would fly on the mission were thoroughly
serviced beforehand, with particular attention to their undercarriages and wheels. These
would have to take the strain of a massive overload during takeoff. Any failure would be
disastrous.







Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/00910460_086.jpg



Finally, six B-24's were loaded to 68,500 pounds, and sent off on a route that roughly
approximated the distance to Balikpapan and back (although flying over friendly or neutral
territory). When they returned, their fuel consumption was carefully measured. To
everyone's relief, they all made it back safely, with adequate fuel reserves.



Astonishingly, all this work was accomplished in a matter of seven or eight days. While the
specialists were busy, the airfield operations staff made their own preparations. Some of
the B-24's would fly to Noemfoor Island from other bases, land at Kornasoren, and refuel, to
join those already there on the strike. Crash trucks, cranes and bulldozers were assembled at
Kornasoren, to clear the runways of any crashed aircraft as quickly as possible. Palm trees at
either end of the runway were chopped down or trimmed, to give the heavily laden aircraft more
room to get airborne. Pilots were warned that if they encountered mechanical problems
immediately after takeoff, they were to jump from their aircraft over the sea and let it crash,
rather than try to land again, as this would disrupt the departure of other aircraft.



The navigators sat down to plan the route. The aircraft would have to arrive over Balikpapan
during daylight in order to bomb accurately, so their departure was fixed for just after
midnight. A route was planned that avoided Japanese-held territory, and skirted known enemy
air bases and anti-aircraft defenses as far as possible.

The bombers were too heavily laden at the outset to gain enough altitude to cross the mountains
of northern New Guinea. They would therefore fly South-West to a low point on the coast of New
Guinea, then turn West, crossing the Ceram Sea. Shortly before reaching the Soela Islands
they would turn North-West, flying up into the Molucca Sea, before turning slightly North of
West and heading for the assembly point in the Celebes (today called Sulawesi ). From there,
they would turn West-South-West to Mangar, and then South-West to Balikpapan. The return
route would be in reverse.



Trying to fly in formation at night would be very difficult with such overloaded, unstable
aircraft, and would increase fuel consumption. The bombers would therefore take off at
60-second intervals, and fly alone to the assembly point. Having rendezvoused there, they
would form a series of six groups, each of twelve aircraft. Each group would then head for a
Japanese airfield at Mangar. This was about thirty miles North-East of Balikpapan, and would
serve as the Initial Point (IP) for their bomb runs. Of course, it had the disadvantage that
Japanese fighters based there would be perfectly positioned to intercept the bombers: but
there was no other easily-identifiable landmark near Balikpapan, so the airport it had to be.







Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/B-24_Over_Salamaua.jpg



Pilots were warned that they had to adhere rigorously to the 60-second takeoff separation.
Any delay would cause further problems at the assembly point, which would waste precious
gasoline. They were informed that even a 30-second delay per plane, over the 72 bombers taking
part in the raid, would add up to a delay of more than half an hour over the assembly point - and
that would waste so much fuel that some of the aircraft wouldn't have enough to get home.
Therefore, even if Japanese bombers raided the airfield during the takeoff process, the
lights would remain on and the aircraft were to continue taking off at their prescribed
intervals.



The crews were fully briefed for the first time on September 29th, 1944. Take-off was set for
00.30 on September 30th. There was much muttering when those who hadn't yet been told, learned
their take-off weight. All knew that getting off from an uneven perforated steel plating
runway, laid over dirt, with such grossly overloaded aircraft, would be far from easy.

The Australian observer reports that the crews were further disgruntled by the sight of the
tents of a field hospital hurriedly being moved from one end of the runway, in case crashing
overloaded B-24's might prove hazardous to the patients' health. One crewman (perhaps the
gunner quoted earlier?) reportedly asked acidly, "And what happens if I need a *******
hospital in a hurry?"



It's reported that hundreds of onlookers turned up at Kornasoren airfield to watch the planes
depart. The word had spread that this raid was 'something special'. Improvised lighting
(including dozens of vehicles with their headlights trained along the runways) was switched
on, and at half an hour past midnight the first waddling, straining, overloaded B-24 lumbered
down the runway, lifting off at the last possible moment and disappearing into the darkness,
only a few feet above the ground. Plane after plane followed, some lurching alarmingly as they
hit an uneven patch on the runway, but all made it safely into the air. Two had to return within an
hour or two, having experienced mechanical difficulties, but 70 bombers set off on their
individual paths over nine hundred miles of hostile ocean to the assembly point.

The planes took six hours to cover the distance. Every hour, as detailed on their schedules,
the crews moved equipment around and took up new positions, to keep the overburdened aircraft
balanced as well as possible. Navigators took star sights through their astrodomes, and
tried to take bearings on the few islands they sighted. Most of these were invisible against
the black Pacific, as few of them had any electricity to power lights. Most were detectable
only by the massive cumulus clouds that built up over them, showing their approximate
location. The navigators gulped, crossed their fingers, and pressed on.



In a remarkable display of individual precision navigation, far better than usually
achieved in the Pacific war, all of the aircraft found the assembly point almost exactly on
time. The first 12 aircraft, forming the first bombing group, assembled within 13 minutes
after the first's scheduled arrival time. The leader of the first group, Colonel Thomas C.
Musgrave Jr., circled the assembly point, firing a red flare and flashing an Aldis lamp. The
other aircraft of his group joined up with him as he circled. As soon as his group had been
formed, he led it off towards the Initial Point at Mangar, while the leader of the second group
began forming his flock.



As the first group approached Mangar, Musgrave noticed two twin-engined Japanese aircraft
approaching. They didn't attack, but took up station parallel with his formation, just
outside machine-gun range. It was obvious that they were continuously reporting his
position, course, speed and altitude to the waiting defenders at Mangar and Balikpapan.
There was nothing that could be done to stop them, in the absence of escorting fighters.
Musgrave's crews could only grit their teeth and keep going.

The group arrived over Mangar to find, to their dismay, that thick cloud completely covered
the land. They couldn't know whether it would extend as far as Balikpapan. Again, they had no
choice, so they took up their heading for Balikpapan and hoped for the best. Strangely, no
enemy fighters or anti-aircraft gunfire were encountered . . . but they needn't have worried.
Halfway between Mangar and Balikpapan, the Japanese fighters boiled up out of the cloud
cover, and the fight was on.



As one observer reported:





The Nips were eager beyond anything that anyone had ever experienced. They came to within 25
feet of the bombers, blazing away with all their guns. They flew into and through the
formation. They got above the bombers and went into almost vertical dives, every gun shooting
as they came down. It all seemed as though they had been sent up with orders to stop the raid, to
turn it away at all costs. Balikpapan was vital to the Jap war and the Jap knew it.



The planes plodded on. The gunners were shooting away. A Jap plane here and there went down.
Finally the planes came to the target area itself, and to the bullets and cannon shells of the
enemy airplanes now were added the shells from the anti-aircraft on the ground. The flak was
thick and heavy and the Jap fighters ignored it and kept attacking through it. That in itself
was unusual. It's more normal for fighters to break away when their flak takes over, but the
Nips disregarded their own ground fire and pressed in.



Musgrave saw part of the refinery through a hole in the clouds. However, before he could lead
his group into position, the hole closed. Rather than bomb blind through the clouds, he
decided to circle and wait until his bomb-aimers could see what they were aiming at. They had
all been briefed about the importance of this target, and didn't want to throw their bombs away
on empty countryside. For 45 minutes the group circled, being joined meanwhile by succeeding
groups, until they could see their targets clearly: then they headed in and dropped their
bombs.

The bombing was accurate, although there weren't enough planes and bombs to do the job on a
single raid. Four more would be needed before production at Balikpapan was sufficiently
disrupted to render it useless to the Japanese war effort. Nevertheless, the B-24's hit part
of the refinery, including some of the most important machinery, and seriously impacted its
production. Regrettably, their success came at a very high cost. Forced to circle and wait for
the cloud to clear, the bombers gave the Japanese fighters a field day. Almost every B-24 was
severely damaged. Two of Musgrave's group went down, and many others had casualties among
their crews from the hail of enemy fire.

One of the more dramatic reminiscences of the raid comes from the crew of First Lt. Oliver L.
Adair. His aircraft was hit in an engine, as well as the wings, tail and fuselage. Oil from the
damaged engine caught fire, sending a 50-foot streamer of flame out behind the wing. Adair
ignored the flames, figuring (rightly) that they'd go out as soon as the oil was consumed,
rammed his three remaining engines to full power, and pressed on.



His right-hand waist gunner, Staff Sergeant Charles F. Held, had his .50-caliber
machine-gun shot out of his hands. The Japanese fire destroyed its mounting and shot off its
sight, and damaged the rear of the gun. Undaunted, Held made his parachute pack into a chest
cushion, picked up the damaged gun, braced it against the parachute pack and opened fire once
more, holding the barrel with his gloved hand to steady the heavy weapon. He didn't hit
anything (not surprising without sights), but his fire, indicated by the line of tracer
bullets reaching out from his weapon, caused more than one Japanese fighter to flinch and
sheer off, rather than press home an attack.



Held could fire only a few rounds at a time. The heavy recoil of the .50-caliber weapon would
drive him right across the fuselage to slam into the other side. He'd force himself upright,
walk back to the waist gun window, and fire again, to repeat the process over and over and over
again. By the end of the mission his chest was black-and-blue with bruising from the recoil,
and his hand had been severely burned by the heat of the barrel, even through the glove that he
wore.

The upper turret gunner, Staff Sergeant Wilbur L. Bowen, recalled later:





"Half the time I was praying hard enough to save half the people in the United States. And half
the time I was cursing hard enough to put a good bishop in hell. When I saw three planes coming in
at once with their wing edges sparkling I just prayed they wouldn't hit us. And then when one of
my guns jammed I would pound on the magazine and cuss in the worst way I knew how."



When they finally pulled away from the target, leaving the Japanese fighters behind, the crew
assessed the damage. The fuel tanks in the wings and fuselage were shot full of holes. The crew
tried to plug the leaks with bits of candle, a pencil, a screwdriver and some rags, but it was
soon clear that they didn't have enough fuel left to get home. Furthermore, on only three
engines, the bomber was slowly but steadily losing altitude. The B-24 was not an overpowered
plane at the best of times, and after long service in the Pacific, many of them were old, tired
and worn. Something had to be done.



Lt. Adair decided to head for the island of Morotai , almost four hundred miles closer than
Noemfoor. Morotai had been invaded by US forces on September 15th, 1944 , and fighting was
still going on there. Construction on a bomber airfield, Wama Drome, had begun on September
18th, but was not yet complete, and he didn't know whether a runway would be available for him to
land. However, there were friendly troops on Morotai. That was all that mattered. All knew the
grim fate of those unlucky enough to be taken prisoner by the Japanese.



While the pilots struggled to keep the laboring aircraft in the air, the rest of the crew turned
to throwing out anything and everything that could save weight. As soon as they were clear of
the Japanese fighters, they threw out the machine-guns and remaining ammunition, then
turned to with fire-axes and chopped the ball turret and upper turret to pieces, throwing them
out. It took them three hours hard work to get rid of most of the ball turret (an interior view of
which is shown below), but their axes couldn't cut some braces and armor plate. Finally one of
the crew took his .45 automatic pistol and shot away the rivets holding the metal together. The
pieces plummeted out of the ball-turret's hole in the floor of the aircraft, and fell into the
Pacific.







Image:

The loss of weight proved just sufficient to stabilize the bomber, and Lt. Adair made a perfect
landfall at Morotai. To his immense relief, one runway at Wama Drome was almost complete. The
PSP plating wasn't all installed, but there was a 6,000-foot strip cleared and smoothed. That
was good enough for him, and he headed in, ordering seven of the crew onto the flight deck, in
case the landing gear collapsed and dumped the bomber onto its belly.



The landing gear and brakes held just long enough to slow the B-24 to 85 mph - then the left brake
line sheared, and the right brake locked. The bomber jerked to one side towards an earthen
bank, bounced over it, and careered through a grove of palm trees. One palm stump flew into the
bomb bay and hit Staff Sergeant Held in the right leg. The nose wheel buckled, came off, and
bounced back into the bomb bay to hit his other leg. His language is reported to have been
"spectacular!", including accusing the palm stump, nose-wheel and everything and everyone
else in the airplane's path, of Japanese sympathies: but he wasn't seriously hurt. A
propeller cut through a parked truck as the driver leapt for his life. Finally, the bomber
buried its nose in a sandbank, ten feet from a line of latrines, from which a sergeant fled,
trousers round his ankles (which did little to slow him, according to admiring reports). They
had made it.



Back at Noemfoor, the long, long wait for the returning aircraft continued. Finally, the
first of them appeared, riddled with bullets, parts of the planes missing, but in perfect
formation. One by one they landed, many firing flares that sent ambulances hurrying towards
them at the end of the runway to evacuate seriously wounded crew members. Some aircraft had
damaged landing-gear, and had to belly-land their bombers in clouds of dust and smoke, fire
engines roaring down the runways after them, sirens screaming and bells clanging.







Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kIWY2DV0KnE/STIqOYsdbxI/AAAAAAAAB0k/MR1zuakAOgY/s400/B-24+after+crash-landing.jpg



Some ground crews could only stand and stare at the empty sky. Seven aircraft did not return.
One of them, of course, was Lt. Adair's plane. Six others were lost over Balikpapan, their
sixty crew members killed. They represented an almost 9% loss rate among the 70 aircraft that
took part in the raid.



There would be another raid on Balikpapan three days later. A good account of this raid,
including a lengthy description of the ordeal of one crashed aircrew, may be found here .
Between them, the two initial raids cost 37 B-24's shot down, crash-landed, or so severely
damaged that they never flew again. This was an overall loss rate of almost 26%, more than one
aircraft in four. This was completely unsustainable in the long term, and would have been
unthinkable if it hadn't been for the importance of the target.



Fortunately, matters were to improve. Three more raids later in October were escorted by P-38
Lightning and P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, fitted with newly-arrived long-range drop tanks,
and flying from new bases at Morotai and Sansapor, closer to Balikpapan, so that even with
their shorter range, they could rendezvous with the bombers at the assembly point and give
them protection. The escorting fighters and bomber gunners claimed to have destroyed over 60
Japanese aircraft during the three raids. Overall, 24 B-24's and seven fighters were lost
near or over the target during the five Balikpapan raids, plus many more damaged beyond
repair.



The five raids stopped production at Balikpapan's two refineries and paraffin plant for
almost six months. When it finally resumed, in early 1945, another series of air raids
destroyed the plants completely. Balikpapan never again contributed to the Japanese war
effort.



The Balikpapan raids were relatively minor by European standards, where up to 1,000 bombers
at a time (and sometimes many more) would head for their targets. However, in terms of their
losses, the Pacific airmen were subject to even greater hazards than their comrades in
Europe, with loss ratios consistently higher on such long-distance ventures. Damaged
aircraft in the European theater had to cover only a few hundred miles to reach the safety of
England, or a few score to reach neutral territory in Switzerland or Sweden. Damaged aircraft
in the Pacific might have to fly a thousand miles or more to get home or reach safety . . . and often
their damage was so severe that they didn't make it. Many ditched in the vast, trackless wastes
of the Pacific, and their crews were never heard from again.

To this day, there are islands in the Pacific where the remains of crashed US bombers and
fighters bear grim testimony to the cost of the war. Some are flanked by neat graves, where
searchers came across their dead crews and buried them (most of the bodies later being
recovered and transferred to official US war cemeteries). Others have nothing to record what
happened to those who flew them.

Let's remember the price the Pacific airmen paid for victory.



I've not been able to find any video footage of the Balikpapan raids, or of air operations from
Noemfoor Island. However, there's a remarkable clip shot by Lt-Col. Oscar Fitzhenry, USAF
(Ret.). It shows B-24's and their fighter escort attacking the Japanese-held atoll of Truk in
1943 or 1944. It shows their tight formation heading into the target, gives an idea of what the
bomb run was like, and at the end, shows the bombers returning to base, and the conditions
typical of a Pacific airstrip. It's one of the earliest color films of war, shot in 16mm. with a
handheld camera. It gives a good idea of what things must have been like for the Balikpapan
airmen - except for the losses.











The video below is a compilation of World War II newsreels, showing B-24 operations in Europe
and the Pacific. From 3 minutes 20 seconds into the video, operations in the Pacific and Far
East theaters are shown.

EDITED TO ADD: In March 2009 the son of one of the pilots who flew on the Balikpapan Raid
contacted me, to share his father's memories of the raid and a photograph taken over
Balikpapan. You'll find them here . They add a very human touch to this piece of aviation
history. Posted by Peter at 11/29/2008 11:07:00 PM

        My mother remembers the 380th Bomb Group raids on Japanese targets in her home town
        (Surabaya, East Java). She was only 2-3 years old at the time, but she never forgot the
        steady droning of those massed Pratt & Whitney motors (or the accompanying howl of
        air raid sirens).

        

        If anyone has information on the 380th BG's missions against Surabaya in 1943 and
        1944, please e-mail me:

        I just completed reading (again) from a book published back in 1962 that included a
        sixteen page section on that first raid September 30, 1944. The information
        contained in your story is completely consistent with that account. It turned out
        that on that first raid they lost less than 20 men. Unbelievable!

        My father, Rod Avenius (just turned 91), was on the second bombing raid over
        Balikpapan on Oct 3rd, 1944. It is a great story with more detail, but here’s a
        summary:

        

        My father was added to the regular crew of the B24 as a 'photo-gunner'. By the time the
        second bombing mission transpired the Japanese were well aware that the US planes
        could reach the refinery, and, as my Dad puts it “there were Zeros everywhere”.
        His plane was hit before reaching the target and they were unable to catch-up and get
        into formation. They flew on anyway and dropped their bombs on their own. Knowing
        they would never make it back to their base at Noemfoor, and with mostly open water
        between them and the base, the pilot made two low passes over a peninsula that juts out
        from the Celebes. Half the crew parachuted out on the first pass and half on the second
        pass. Everyone but my Dad landed in the shallow water and swam to shore, with the
        exception of one crew members who was lost (the navigator I believe). My Dad, not
        being one of the regular crew, had to use an emergency chute, which was smaller than
        the others and as such went down faster and landed onshore in a tree. He made it to the
        beach by following a creek bed, where he was able to regroup with the other survivors.
        A couple of days later they were sighted by a friendly submarine and rescued. They
        were taken back to the submarine’s base at Fremantle, Australia. He and his
        buddies finally made it back to their squadron about two weeks later (I believe they
        were on Morotai Island by then).

        

        If anyone has more info on this second bombing mission over Balikpapan I’d be
        grateful to hear about it. I like the webpage!

        In the early days of the war the 19th bomb group flying B17s were "looking" for
        someplace to drop their bombs according to my father and they took a left and headed to
        Balikpapan. All three of them. Completed their mission with additional holes in
        their planes. no losses. They fought with what they had.

        My father, 1st Lieutenant James Fielding, now 90 yrs old, flew 2 missions to
        Balikpapan, Oct. 3 and Oct. 10, 1944. According to the citation awarding him and 2
        others in his crew Silver Stars for their actions, there was no fighter protection on
        either day. Amazing that so many survived. Thank you for posting.

        Please fix the link to the second bombing run on Balikpapan. I have a family member
        Robert Henry Ginter who I think was on that run and parachuted from Lt. Kates plane #
        955 that led the formation. Mission reports read that 3 men parachuted from the
        plane. My grandmother reported that she was contacted by a family member of one of the
        survivors who told her that Robert Ginter was shot trying to escape from the
        Japanese. I would really like to read that second article. Lance Gardner
