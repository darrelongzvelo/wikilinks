Plantimals 2: the solar-mander



with 2 comments

In the previous post , I introduced a sea slug that uses chloroplasts for energy production.
Â This is intended as a companion post about plant-animal hybrids, and will focus on a
photosynthetic salamander.

For several years I’ve nursed a fascination with the idea of plant-animal hybrids. Â I
ask myself what life would be like as a person able to eat sunlight, and findÂ  the answers in
my imagination encouraging. Â While the slug mentioned in my previous post, as aÂ 
mollusk , is a far cry from my vision of harnessing photosynthesis for myself, the discovery of
solar salamanders is downright exciting. Â Salamanders, as vertebrates, are more
closely related to humans and one step closer to the human branch on theÂ  taxonomic tree .

Some argue it is unlikely humans could become photosynthetic in this way, as our digestive
tract chews up what we eat, including chloroplasts and DNA from plants. Â However, a
similar argument could be made about salamanders, yet the inner workings 0f one salamander in
particular has an ingenious work-around.

TheÂ  spotted salamander ( Ambystoma maculatum ) is a secretive amphibian common to
hardwood forests in the Eastern US and Canada. Â A nocturnal fellow, A. maculatum forages
at night and hides during the day under logs, rocks, damp earth and moss on the forest floor.
Â Our salamander possesses skills a ninja would envy: perfect camouflage, glands to
secrete poison from it’s skin and the ability to regenerate lost and damaged body parts.

Now photosynthesis can be added to the salamander’s skill set.

A. maculatum e ggs are laid and develop in water. Â Within each egg, the developing
salamander embryo often forms an association with the algaÂ  Oophilia amblystomatis
(literally “loves salamander eggs” in Latin). Â The relationship — in which the
Oophilia photosynthesizes and produces oxygen for the egg while the developing salamander
metabolizes the oxygen, producing carbon dioxide for the alga to consume — wasÂ  first
categorized as symbiosis in 1958 .

Developing solar-manders (courtesy of Ted Lev

Research reported in July 2010 indicates the relationship between our two symbionts is more
complicated than previously thought. Â Not only does O. amblystomatis provide oxygen for
the salamander egg, the single-celled alga is commonly located inside cells within the
developing salamander’s body . Â Ooxygen produced by algal photosynthesis may be
directly provided to the salamander cells that contain them.

This is the first time such a close co-existence with a photosynthetic organism has been shown
in a vertebrate. Â The mechanism for this symbiosis is unknown. Â The salamander cells
may have turned off their internal immune system, allowing the “non-self”
photosynthetic machinery to function stably inside vertebrate cells.

Such a cunning developmental adaptation would not be a complete surprise, given the spotted
salamander’s ability to regrow limbs as an adult. Â The metabolic acrobatics our
salamander is capable of as an adult may begin with an early symbiotic dalliance in the egg.

Plantimals 1: A photosynthetic sea slug



with one comment

In June 2008 I wrote the following :

On the way to work this morning I drove by an expanse ofÂ iceplant (Carpobrotus edulis)
â€“ considered by some to be aÂ barbarian of the botanical world â€“ and had the
sudden longing for chlorophyll to reside within my skin.

Two years have passed and I remain fascinated by the idea of plant-animal hybrids. Â So it is
with great delight that I am about to introduce two animals who use chloroplasts for energy
production: a sea slug and a salamander. Â While the slug, as aÂ  mollusk , is a far cry from
my vision of harnessing photosynthesis for myself, the discovery of solar salamanders is
downright exciting. Â Salamanders, as vertebrates, are more closely related to humans
and one step closer to the human branch on the taxonomic tree .

I’d intended to cover both animals in a single post, however given the length of the content,
the post be split into a series. Â This first post will feature the sea slug, and the second
will focus on the solarmander.

Image:
http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/elysia-chlorotica-rumpho21.jpg?w=700

Elysia chlorotica (courtesy of Mary Rumpho-Kennedy).

At first glance, the image to the left looks like a leaf, given its shape and color.
Â However, this is a picture of a sea slug, Elysia chlorotica , packed so full of
chloroplasts it is vibrantly green.

The slug E. chlorotica acquires chloroplasts from algae it eats and stores the stolen
energy-makers in the lining of it’s gut. Â Afterward, a sea slug can live the remainder of
it’s life without eating. Â  Energy generated from chloroplasts alone is not sufficient
to sustain our slug, so researchers were puzzled as to how it survived without eating.

Mary Rumpho of the University of Maine, hasÂ discovered how the sea slug gets this ability:
it actuallyÂ photosynthesizes with genes taken from the algae it eats.

Chloroplasts only contain enough DNA to encode about 10% of the proteins needed to keep
themselves running. The other necessary genes are found in the algae’s nuclear DNA. “So
the question has always been, how do they continue to function in an animal cell missing all of
these proteins,” says Rumpho.

In their latest experiments, Rumpho and colleagues sequenced the chloroplast genes ofÂ 
Vaucheria litorea , the alga that is the sea slug’s favourite snack. They confirmed that if
the sea slug used the algal chloroplasts alone, it would not have all the genes needed to
photosynthesise.

They then turned their attention to the sea slug’s own DNA and found one of the vital algal
genes was present ( PNAS November 18, 2008Â vol. 105 ). Its sequence was identical to the
algal version, indicating that the slug had probably stolen the gene from its food.

While other animals may photosynthesize after eating plants, they do so by acquiring entire
plant cells. Â  Our sea slug is unique in that plant genes have been incorporated into the
animal’s own DNA. Â Such a molecular trick is crafty and streamlined, as the slug cells
take both chloroplasts and the genetic instructions required to operate them while leaving
the remainder of the plant cell behind. Â As a result, E. chlorotica are singularly capable
of both animal and plant functions: movement and photosynthesis.

Check out a short clip about these sea slugs here .

Another kind of animal research



with one comment

While I’m not fond of using animals as data points in a research study, research that
actually benefits animals is a separate matter.

Enter Oscar, a cat who underwent a pioneering procedure when both of his hind feet were
amputated. Neuro-orthopaedic surgeon Neol Fitzpatrick rebuilt Oscar’s hind feet with
metal pegs and bioengineered feet. Â Despite the experimental nature of the procedure,
the surgery was a success. Â So much so that Oscar was up and climbing around within minutes
of waking from the anesthesia.

Oscar, the cat with a pair of prosthetic paws (courtesy of Neil Fitzpatrick)

Fitzpatrick’s has been dubbed the “bionic vet” as aÂ resultÂ of work with Oscar
and other animals. Â He is featured in a 6-partÂ  BBC documentary (and he has aÂ 
Facebook page to boot).

Here is a clip showing Oscar’s operation:

And, like most technical innovations, Oscar’s feet got an upgrade:

Daisy chains and fluorescent pets



with 2 comments

For better or worse, the genetic modification of animals is becoming easier and more precise.
Â A suite of modified animals are making an appearance, from modified livestock to model
organisms for scientists and unique pets for consumers.

Image:
http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/glofish_037_std1.jpeg?w=300&h=183

GloFish

Fluorescent fish have come a long way from their origin in a research laboratory. Â 
Modified zebrafish are available for sale in Asia and some parts of the US. Â These aquarium
fish, dubbed theÂ  GloFish , glow in red, green and yellow — the result of inserted genes
from corals and jellyfish.Â Not surprisingly, the fish are not approved for sale in
Australia, Canada, California or Europe.

 

Genetic modification of livestock is one take on how to improve animal welfare and decrease
suffering known to take place in large-scale industrial stockyards. Â Take theÂ 
pre-plucked chicken :

“There’s interest in breeding this trait into fast-growing broiler chickens, to create
birds that are less prone to heat stress and do not require plucking”.

Image:
http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/pre-plucked-chickens1.jpg?w=336&h=253

A pre-plucked chicken

While such a trait appears to offer an alternative to stressors of factory farming, breeding
chickens for a single trait has been shown to cause a series of unexpected consequences.
Â For example,Â  chickens selectively bred for high egg production use much of their
calcium to produce egg shells. The result are hens with weak skeletons, brittle bones and
difficulty bearing their own weight. Â These hens often fracture bones during typical
movements like standing, walking or hopping.

Approximately 35% of all mortalities among caged hens were attributable to bone fragility,
known as cage layer osteoporosis (1).

And animals continue to be relied upon for scientific research. Â The diversity in
research animals has boomed, with cats, marmosets and pigs replacing mice as model organisms
in some studies. Â Pigs are particularly of interest in the study of human diseases like
cystis fibrosis and high cholesterol. Â Because pig hearts and arteries are similar in
size to those of humans, modified pigs are considered realistic “ testbeds ” for stents
and other medical devices.

Image:
http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/fluorescent-felines1.jpeg?w=300&h=225

The fluorescent cat on the left, whose skin glows in ultraviolet light, is one of two created in
South Korea, in 2007 (Image: Yonhago, Choi Byong-kii/AP/PA).

Pigs are also the focus of xenotransplant research, as they are considered to be the source of
an unlimited supply of organs needed by humans awaiting transplants. Â Pig-to-human
organ transplants have hitherto been unsuccessful because the human immune system
recognizes the organs as foreign and rejects them. Â It is thought that humans may be more
tolerant of transplants from modified organisms; silencing the expression of molecules in
pigs may be the key. Interestingly, some xenotransplant research is being tested on monkeys.
Â Organs are grown in a pig that is sacrificed, then transplanted into a monkey that will not
survive more than 180 days after the operation. Â What a gruesome daisy chain of animal
testing…that has yet to benefit humans.

Necessary, evil or a necessary evil?



leave a comment »

Image: http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/labrat11.jpg?w=700

An animal or a statistic?

Animal research has been considered either necessary, evil or a necessary evil depending on
who you speak with. Â In the wake of several recent studies that reveal the shortcomings of
animal research, some are changing their stance, moving away from viewing the research as
“necessary” to a middle ground of the “necessary evil” perspective. Â The shift
isn’t entirely surprising, as some of the problems identified in today’s animal studies
are that animal experiments are poorly designed, conducted, reported and reviewed. Â For
example:

The survey of 271 UK and US studies found, for example, that only 59 per cent included the aim of
the research and 4 per cent failed to report how many animals were used.

One outcome of this recent evaluation of animal research is an international effort to
establish guidelines and regulations for studies including animals, with the UK taking the
lead in doing so. Â The National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of
Animals in Research (NC3Rs) , established by the UK Government, has published theÂ  ARRIVE
(Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines . Â The ARRIVE guidelines
are intended to improve the standards of reporting animals used in research, and in so doing,
ensure that every animal life used counts .

Bird



with one comment

A sharp intake of breath, held for 1:04 minutes. Â That is what happened after I watched the
clip of Andrew Zuckerman’s bird footage on New Scientist . Â The video is a teaser for Bird
, both a masterpiece of bird photography and a hefty addition to the coffee table.

As image-oriented as this blog is, I’m intentionally not posting any for this post out of
respect for Zuckerman’s copyright. Â It’s an expression of admiration, really.
Â Be sure to check out his site Bird . Â Hopefully the images there will explain my awe, as
I’m having a rough time doing so with words.

Death of an Ambassador



with one comment

Image:
http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/great-white-shark-ambassador.jpg?w=700

Great white shark at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, 2009

Sad news: a great white shark ambassador — one of 5 white sharks exhibited by and
successfully released from the Monterey Bay Aquarium — was caught in a fishing net and died.

A young great white shark that was released from the Monterey Bay Aquarium has died in a fishing
net off the coast of Baja California.

The aquarium says in a statement Tuesday that the shark, which was fitted with electronic
tracking tags, was on exhibit for 69 days before her release and traveled about 500 miles
south. She was caught in a fishing net in early March.

The aquarium’s Randy Hamilton says the death underscores the threats the young sharks face
in the wild.

The sharks are legally protected in California and Mexico but are sometimes accidentally
caught by commercial fishermen. The aquarium said this shark was the only one of the five white
sharks exhibited known to have died following its release.

(from the San Francisco Chronicle )

Following her release in November 2009, the shark was monitored by scientists involved
withÂ Monterey Bay Aquarium’sÂ  White Shark Project . Â This
projectÂ promotes study, awareness and conservation of these magnificent animals.

http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/white-shark.jpg?w=700

The Aquarium's most recent white shark

I can imagine some readers wondering why great white sharks are in need of conservation.
Â Here is what the Aquarium has to say about white sharks:

Despite popular perceptions of sharks as invincible, shark populations around the world are
declining because of overfishing, habitat destruction and other human activities. Of the
350 or so species of sharks, 79 are imperiled, according to the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature. White sharks are top predators in the sea but, they’re in grave
danger of being depleted.

(from Monterey Bay Aquarium )

I encourage you to check out the beautiful (and informative!) Conservation Research section
on Aquarium’s site . Â You will find several pages dedicated to education about white
shark research and the other conservation programs going on at the Aquarium. Â The
pictures alone are worth the click!

The salty chill of Asilomar



with 2 comments

Image: http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/1.jpeg?w=700

Asilomar Beach, California

It’s impossible to count the number of times I’ve been to Monterey. Â In my mind, a beach
is a rocky cove with a slight bank of sand, frigid water and anemones withstanding violent
tides. Â On my single trip to a beach in Florida I was astounded by the silken sand, tepid
water and vast expanse of blue. Â The experience was vibrant, yet I missed the salty chill of
Asilomar.

Image: http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/2.jpeg?w=700

A rocky cove (at my favorite beach!)

Likewise, I’ve seen the Monterey Bay Aquarium evolve as an educational center. Â I’ve
been reading up on the aquarium’s conservation research programs . including those
studying the rehabilitation of the aesthetically pleasing sea otter as well that of the
magnificent white shark.

The Monterey Bay Aquariumâ€™s Sea Otter Research and Conservation (SORAC) program has
been studying and trying to save the threatened southern sea otter since 1984. We rescue treat
and release injured otters, raise and release stranded pups through our surrogate program,
provide care for sea otters that canâ€™t return to the wild, and conduct scientific
research.

Image: http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/3.jpeg?w=700&h=233

A southern sea otter in the Monterey Bay, California

I imagine it would be wonderful to swim amidst the kelp, rubbing elbows with otters and urchins
(ow!). Â So much so that I’ve begun saving up for scuba lessons — my first open water dive
may very well be in Monterey!

And to close with a warm fuzzy in the heart, here’s a warm fuzzy in the water:

Whale song



with one comment Miette: One? Â You asleep? Â What did you do before? One: One sailor.
Â Harpooned whales. Â One night…One hear whales singing. Â After…always the
target I miss. One loses job. From The City of Lost Children

Whale song has a reputation for being hauntingly beautiful. Â The first time I heard it was
likely 20+ years ago, on a free record of whale tunes that came inside an issue of National
Geographic. Â The record was thin and square-shaped (as opposed to the typical round
45″), which made the recording both acoustically and visually impressive.

As I no longer have the National Geographic record — or my Fisher Price record player, for
that matter — I’ve needed to move on. Â Fortunately, it’s relatively easy to find
whale songÂ  audio files .

Free admission to the Lindsay Wildlife Museum on 3/7/10



with one comment

This weekend marked the halfway point in my training to be a wildlife rehabilitation
volunteer at theÂ  Lindsay Wildlife Museum ! Â Once trained, I’ll provide care for
injured and orphaned wildlife at the LWM hospital, including accessioning into the
hospital, setting up housing, preparing food, feeding, cleaning enclosures and hospital
housekeeping (laundry, dishes, general cleaning).

Image:
http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/gifts-broke.jpg?w=700

My relationship with the LWM began last summer, when I rescued a gull bound up in fishing line
and dangling from overhead telephone wires. Â Once the gull was safely brought down (with
the help of PG&E), it was clear the left wing was damaged and the bird couldn’t fly. Â It was
getting late in the evening, so I took the gull home for the night. Â When the gull was safely
crated, I searched online for wildlife rescue organizations nearby. Â I was surprised to
learn animal shelters aren’t connected with wildlife centers; if I’d taken the gull to
animal control, it would have been euthanized. Â After several phone calls I talked with
the hospital at the LWM in Walnut Creek and found a new “home” for the gull. Â I soon made
the first — of what have become many — trip to the LWM.

A wee bobcat (bobkitten?)

In addition to the resources the hospital provides, the museum itself is a remarkable
education center in the greater Bay Area. Â Here’s a handful of text from the LWM website ,
which I encourage you to check out:

Lindsay Wildlife Museum:Â Connecting people with wildlife and inspiring
responsibility and respect for the world we share.

Lindsay Wildlife Museum is a unique natural history and environmental education center
where live, wild animals are just inches away. Visitors can listen to the cry of a red tailed
hawk, go eye-to-eye with a gray fox and watch a bald eagle eat lunch. More than 50 species of
live, non-releasable, native California animals are on exhibit.

Tens of thousands of children learn about the environment in their classrooms through our
traveling education programs and on-site tours of the museum. Nature and science-oriented
classes and trips are offered for adults and children. More than 600 volunteers help feed and
care for wild animals, teach children and adults about nature, and support the
museumâ€™s mission in many other ways.

Science: explained!



with one comment

Below is one of the best videos I’ve seen for visualizing genetics, inheritance and
epigenetics. Â When I was an undergrad, the field of epigenetics was on the bleeding edge of
discovery, and I was left with a hazy idea of what epigenetics might be. Â After watching the
inspired video below, I now feel more comfortable with the concept of genetic
tags…although if asked to explain it I’d likely used a metaphor involving lengths of rope
and push pins.

The Epigenetics of Identical Twins

Identical twins are indistinguishable as children but they develop physical differences
when they become adults. This video uses a creative approach â€“ pieces of rope and
everyday objects â€“ to explain one reason for this: the chemical changes that cells
make to chromosomes.

Video: Why identical twins develop differences as they age



Image:
http://anthropometaphors.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/epigenetics.jpg?w=700

What do you think about the scientific content? Â The presentation? Â And, if asked,
could you explain epigenetics?

As for the video, it is one of the winners in an international science challenge:

For the past seven years a panel of experts in the visualisation of science, brought together
by the US National Science Foundation and the journal Science , have selected the
photographs, graphics, illustrations and video that best aid the explanation of science and
scientific findings for the International Science and Engineering Visualization
Challenge .

The entries are judged for their scientific significance, freshness and originality, as

Octopus



leave a comment »

It’s a walking octopus. Â Carrying a coconut.

Octopuses have been discovered tip-toeing with coconut-shell halves suctioned to their
undersides, then reassembling the halves and disappearing inside for protection or
deception, a new study says.

Break the fence and escape



with 3 comments

On a recent drive home from work I noticed a circus off I-880.Â  The advertisements featured
tigers, which immediately caught my attention.Â  I fantasized about how to meet the
tigers, partly to have a close encounter and partly to assess their conditions in circus
captivity.Â  Needless to say, nothing came of these fantasies.

I’m not the only one interested in the health and well-being of captive animals.Â  A
recent article in Animal Welfare describes the results of a study designed to assess the
welfare of animals in circuses.Â  Not surprisingly, circus life is unhealthy for wild
animals .Â  A combination of lack of space, social contact and exercise is beastly; when
combined with stage performance and travel conditions, the confinement of animals to a
circus is simply brutal.

Stars of the show they may be, but elephants, lions and tigers are the wild animals least suited
to life in a circus, concludes the first global study of animal welfare in circuses.

“It’s no one single factor,” says Stephen Harris of the University of Bristol, UK, and
lead researcher of the study. “Whether it’s lack of space and exercise, or lack of social
contact, all factors combined show it’s a poor quality of life compared with the wild,” he
says.

The survey concludes that on average, wild animals spend just 1 to 9 per cent of their time
training, and the rest confined to cages, wagons or enclosures typically covering a quarter
the area recommended for zoos.

Worst affected are elephants, lions, tigers and bears. Often they’re confined to cages
where they pace up and down for hours on end.

“Even if they are in a larger, circus pen, there’s no enrichment such as logs to play with,
in case they use them to break the fence and escape,” says Harris.

Where in the world is there a home for such fierce predators?
