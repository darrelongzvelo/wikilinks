Avril Ramona Lavigne (pronunciation: / Ëˆ ÃŠ v r Éš l l É™ Ëˆ v iË� n / ; AV -ril l
É™ - VEEN ; born 27 September 1984) is a Canadian singer-songwriter . She was born in
Belleville , Ontario , but spent most of her youth in the small town of Napanee . By the age of 15,
she had appeared on stage with Shania Twain ; by 16, she had signed a two-album recording
contract with Arista Records worth more than $2Â million. In 2002, when she was 17 years
old, Lavigne broke onto the music scene with her debut album Let Go .

Let Go made Lavigne the youngest female soloist to reach No. 1 in the UK, and the album was
certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . By 2009,
over 16 million copies had been sold worldwide. Her breakthrough single, “ Complicated
“, peaked at No. 1 in many countries around the world, as did the album Let Go . Her second
album, Under My Skin , was released in 2004 and was her first album to peak at No. 1 on the U.S.
Billboard 200 , eventually selling more than 10 million copies worldwide. The Best Damn Thing
, Lavigneâ€™s third album, was released in 2007, becoming her third No. 1 album in the UK
Albums Chart and featuring her first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single, “ Girlfriend “.
Lavigne has scored six number-one singles worldwide, including “Complicated”, “
Sk8er Boi “, “ I’m with You “, “ My Happy Ending “, “ Nobody’s Home “, and
“Girlfriend”. With more than 30 million copies of her albums sold worldwide, Lavigne is
one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the U.S., with over 10.25Â million
copies certified by the RIAA. Her fourth studio album, Goodbye Lullaby , was released in March
2011. Goodbye Lullaby gave Lavigne her fourth top 10 album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and the UK
Albums Chart and her third No. 1 album in both Japan and Australia. Three months after the
release of Goodbye Lullaby , Lavigne began work on her fifth album, which will be released on
Epic Records following her departure from RCA Records .

Lavigne branched out from recording music, pursuing careers in feature film acting and
designing clothes and perfumes. She voiced a character in the animated film, Over the Hedge ,
in 2006. That same year, she made her on-screen feature film debut in Fast Food Nation . In 2008,
Lavigne introduced her clothing line, Abbey Dawn , and in 2009, she released her first
perfume, Black Star , which was followed by her second perfume, Forbidden Rose , in 2010 and her
third perfume, Wild Rose, in 2011. In July 2006, Lavigne married her boyfriend of two years,
Deryck Whibley , lead singer and guitarist for Sum 41 . The marriage lasted a little over three
years, and in October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce. Whibley and Lavigne continued to work
together, with Whibley producing her fourth album, as well as Lavigne’s single, “ Alice
“, written for Tim Burton ‘s film Alice in Wonderland .

Early life

Avril Ramona Lavigne was born in Belleville , Ontario. Her father, Jean-Claude Lavigne,
named her “Avril” after the French word for the month of April. At the age of two, she began
singing church songs with her mother, Judith-Rosanne “Judy” (nÃ©e Loshaw). Judy
recognized her two-year-old daughter’s talents after hearing her sing “ Jesus Loves Me
” in church. Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle, both of
whom teased her when she sang. “My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing
myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying.”

When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to Napanee , Ontario , a town with a population
of approximately 5,000. Although she struggled to pay attention in school, sometimes being
kicked out of class for misbehaving, her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her
a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a
studio. When Lavigne was 14, her parents would take her to karaoke sessions. Lavigne also
performed at country fairs, singing songs by Garth Brooks , The Dixie Chicks , and Shania
Twain. She also began writing her own songs. Her first song was called “Can’t Stop
Thinking About You”, about a teenage crush, which she described as “cheesy cute”.
â€œ Iâ€™ve known all my life that this is what I was supposed to do…. Visualizing
like what it would be like to be famous with my music. And always just dreaming, always
daydreaming.

â€�

â€”Avril Lavigne, NBC News [7]

In 1999, Â Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with fellow Canadian singer Shania Twain
at the Corel Centre (now Scotiabank Place ) in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people.
Twain and Lavigne sang “ What Made You Say That “, and Lavigne told Twain that she was going
to be “a famous singer”.During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne
was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song,
“Touch the Sky”, for his 1999 album, Quinte Spirit . She later sang on “Temple of Life”
and “Two Rivers” for his follow-up album, My Window to You , in 2000. In December 1999,
Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing
country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Kingston , Ontario. Fabri sent out VHS tapes of
Lavigne’s home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by
several executives. Mark Jowett, co-founder of the Canadian management firm Nettwerk ,
received a copy of Lavigne’s karaoke performances recorded in her parents’ basement.
Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with Peter Zizzo during the summer of 2000 in New York,
where she wrote the song “Why”. Lavigne was noticed by Arista Records on a subsequent trip
to New York.

Lavigne would go on to sell more than 30 million copies of her albums worldwide, becoming one of
the top-selling artists releasing albums in the U.S., with over 10.25Â million copies
certified by the RIAA. In 2009, Billboard named Lavigne the No. 10 pop artist in the “Best of
the 2000s” chart. She was listed as the 28th overall best act of the decade based on album and
single chart performance in the U.S.

Music career



2000â€“03: Let Go



Main article: Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)

In November 2000, Ken Krongard, an A&R representative, invited Antonio “L.A.” Reid,
then head of Arista Records, to producer Peter Zizzo’s Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne
sing. Her 15-minute audition “so impressed” Reid that he immediately signed her to
Arista with a deal worth $1.25Â million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a
publishing advance. By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her
hometown high school’s skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but
although she enjoyed skateboarding , school left her feeling insecure. Armed with a record
deal, she dropped out to focus on her music career, but she still had to inform her parents of her
decision. “I wasn’t going to turn [the record deal] down. It’s been my dream all my life.
They knew how much I wanted this and how much I’ve put into it.”

Reid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility for overseeing Lavigne’s development and
the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different
co-writers trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told HitQuarters that for
while they struggled finding her sound and although early collaborations with
songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some
good songs, they didn’t match her and her voice. It was only when Lavigne then went to Los
Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with The Matrix production team â€“ including
“Complicated” â€“ that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough.
Lavigne then worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness.
Recording finished in January 2002.

Lavigne released her debut album, Let Go , on 4 June 2002 in the U.S., where it reached No. 2 on the
Billboard 200. It peaked at No. 1 on the Australian, Canadian, and UK charts. This made
Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a No. 1 album in the UK until that
time. By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times platinum by the RIAA, making her
the bestselling female artist of 2002 and Let Go the top-selling debut of the year. By May 2003,
Let Go had accumulated over 1,000,000 sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification
from the Canadian Recording Industry Association . As of 2009, the album has sold over 16
million units worldwide, and the RIAA has certified the album six-times platinum, denoting
shipments of over six million units in the U.S. â€œ I don’t get overwhelmed, just
because I feel like I’ve kind of prepared myself for it. All my life this is what I’ve
wanted, what I’ve dreamed about, and I knew this would happen. I’ve been singing ever
since I was really young and I’ve wanted this so bad, and I told myself I would do it.

â€�

â€”Avril Lavigne on her success, MTV [5]

Lavigne’s debut single and the album’s lead single , “Complicated”, peaked at No. 1
in Australia and No. 2 in the U.S. “Complicated” was one of the bestselling Canadian
singles of 2002, and it was also featured on the teen television show, Dawson’s Creek .
“Complicated” later ranked on the Hot 100 Singles of the Decade list at No. 83.

Subsequent singles, “Sk8er Boi” and “I’m With You” reached the top ten in the U.S.
Thanks to the success of her first three singles, Lavigne was the second artist in history to
have three No. 1 songs from a debut album on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 . For the music video
to “Complicated”, Lavigne was named Best New Artist at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards .
She won four Juno Awards in 2003 out of six nominations, [27] received a World Music Award for
“World’s Bestselling Canadian Singer”, and was nominated for eight Grammy Awards ,
including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for “Complicated” (2003).

In 2002, Lavigne made a cameo appearance in the music video to “ Hundred Million ” by the pop
punk band Treble Charger . In March 2003, Lavigne posed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine
and, later in May, performed “ Fuel ” during MTV’s Icon tribute to Metallica . During her
first headlining tour, the Try To Shut Me Up Tour , Lavigne covered Green Day ‘s “ Basket
Case “.

Lavigne was featured in the 2003 game, The Sims: Superstar , as a non-playable celebrity . [34]

2004â€“05: Under My Skin



Main article: Under My Skin (Avril Lavigne album)

Lavigne co-wrote “ Breakaway ” with Matthew Gerard, which was recorded by Kelly Clarkson
for the soundtrack to the 2004 film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement .
“Breakaway” would later be included on Clarkson’s second album and released as the
album’s lead single. Lavigne covered the Goo Goo Dolls song “Iris”, performed with the
band’s lead singer John Rzeznik at Fashion Rocks , [36] and she posed for the cover of Maxim in
October 2004. [37] She also recorded the theme song for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie . “I
made the song a little more edgy”, Lavigne said. “There are a lot of loud guitars, and we
picked the tempo up a little and sang it with a little more attitude.” Lavigne rearranged the
song with the help of producer Butch Walker. [38]

Lavigne’s second studio album, Under My Skin , was released on 25 May 2004, debuting at No. 1
in several countries, including Australia, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the U.S. [39]
The album has sold more than 10 million copies. Lavigne wrote most of the album’s tracks with
Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk . Kreviazuk’s husband, Our Lady Peace
front man Raine Maida , co-produced the album, along with Butch Walker and Don Gilmore.
Lavigne went on the Live and By Surprise twenty-one-city mall tour in the US and Canada to
promote the album, accompanied by her guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld . Each performance
consisted of a short live acoustic set of songs from the new album. At the end of 2004, Lavigne
embarked on her first world tour, the Bonez Tour , which had stopovers in almost every
continent and lasted for the entire 2005 year. â€œ This record definitely proves that
I’m a writer and people can’t knock that, because each song comes from a personal
experience of mine, and there are so much emotions in those songs.

â€�

â€”Avril Lavigne, The Ledger [40]

“ Don’t Tell Me “, the lead single of the album, went to No. 1 in Argentina and Mexico and
reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia and Brazil. “My Happy
Ending”, the album’s second single, went to No. 1 in Mexico and the top five in the UK and
Australia. In the US, it reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 and went to No. 1 in the
Mainstream Top 40, making it her fourth-biggest hit there. The third single, “ Nobody’s
Home “, did not make the top 40 in the US, reaching No. 1 only in Mexico and Argentina. The
fourth single from the album, “ He Wasn’t “, reached top 40 positions in the UK and
Australia and was not released in the U.S. [41]

Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2004 for “World’s Best Pop/Rock Artist” and
“World’s Bestselling Canadian Artist”. She received five Juno Award nominations in
2005, and picked up three, including “Artist of the Year”. She won the award for
“Favorite Female Singer” at the eighteenth annual Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards

2006â€“08: The Best Damn Thing



Main article: The Best Damn Thing

On 26 February 2006, Lavigne represented Canada at the closing ceremony of the Torino
Olympics , performing her song “Who Knows” during the eight minute Vancouver 2010
portion. [43]

While Lavigne was in the studio for her third studio album, Fox Entertainment Group
approached her to write a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 fantasy-adventure film Eragon .
She wrote and recorded two “ballad-type” songs, but only one, “ Keep Holding On “, was
used for the film. [44] Lavigne admitted that writing the song was challenging, making sure it
flowed with the film. She emphasized that “Keep Holding On”, which later appeared on the
album, was not indicative of what the next album would be like. [45] [46

Lavigne's third album, The Best Damn Thing , was released on 17 April 2007, which Lavigne
immediately promoted with a small tour. Its lead single, " Girlfriend ", topped the Billboard
Hot 100 the same week The Best Damn Thing debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart.
"Girlfriend" was Lavigne's first single to reach this No. 1 position. [47] The single was a
worldwide hit; it also peaked at No. 1 in Australia, Canada, Japan, and Italy and reached No. 2
in the UK and France. “Girlfriend” was recorded in Spanish, French, Italian,
Portuguese, German, Japanese, and Mandarin. The International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry ranked “Girlfriend” as the most-downloaded track worldwide in
2007, selling 7.3Â million copies, including the versions recorded in eight different
languages. [48] [12] “Girlfriend” ranked on the Hot 100 Singles of the Decade list at No.
94. [49]

“ When You’re Gone “, the second single, went to No. 3 in the UK, the top five in Australia
and Italy, the top ten in Canada, and was close to reaching the top twenty in the U.S. In December
2007, Lavigne, with annual earnings of $12Â million, was ranked number eight in the Forbes
“Top 20 Earners Under 25″. [50] “ Hot ” was the third single and has been Lavigne’s
least successful single in the U.S., charting only at No. 95. In Canada, “Hot” made the top
ten, and in Australia, the top 20. The Best Damn Thing has sold over 6 million copies worldwide.

During this era, Lavigne won nearly every award she was nominated for, including two World
Music Awards for “World’s Bestselling Canadian Artist” and “World’s Best
Pop/Rock Female Artist”. She took her first two MTV Europe Music Awards , received one Teen
Choice Awards for “Summer Single”, and was nominated for five Juno awards.

In mid-2007, Lavigne was featured in a two-volume graphic novel , Avril Lavigne’s Make 5
Wishes . She collaborated with artist Camilla Dâ€™Errico and writer Joshua Dysart on
the manga , which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero Avril Lavigne,
learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, “I know that many of my fans read manga, and
I’m really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy.” The
volumes were released on 10 April (one week prior to the release of The Best Damn Thing ) and in
July, respectively. The publication Young Adult Library Services nominated the series for
“Great Graphic Novels for Teens”. [51]

In March 2008, Lavigne undertook a world tour named The Best Damn Tour to support the album. In
that same month, she also appeared on the cover of Maxim for the second time of her career. [52]
In mid-August, Malaysia’s Islamic opposition party, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party ,
attempted to ban Lavigne’s show in Kuala Lumpur , judging her stage moves “too sexy”.
Her concert on 29 August was considered as promoting wrong values ahead of Malaysia’s
independence day on 31 August. [53] On 21 August 2008, MTV reported that the concert had been
approved by the Malaysian government. [54]

2009â€“11: Goodbye Lullaby



Main article: Goodbye Lullaby

Lavigne singing in Florida during her Black Star Tour , May 2011.

Only a month after completing The Best Damn Tour, Lavigne began recording in her home studio in
November 2008 with the song “Black Star”, [55] written to help promote her first
fragrance of the same name. [56] By July 2009, nine tracks had been recorded for the new album,
[55] including the songs “Fine”, “Everybody Hurts” and “Darlin”. Several of
the tracks were written in Lavigne’s youth. “Darlin” was the second song Lavigne wrote
as a 15-year-old while living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne described the album as being about
“life”. She stated, “It’s so easy for me to do a boy-bashing pop song, but to sit down
and write honestly about something that’s really close to me, something I’ve been
through, it’s a totally different thing.” [56] With the exception of the album’s lead
single, “ What the Hell “, Lavigne described the songs on the album as different from her
earlier material: “I’m older now, so I think that comes across in my music, it’s not as
pop-rock “. [57]

In January 2010, while simultaneously writing and recording for her new album, Lavigne
worked with Disney clothing designs inspired by Tim Burton ‘s feature film, Alice in
Wonderland . She asked the executives if she could write a song for the film. The result was the
song “ Alice “, [58] which was played over the end credits [59] and included on the
soundtrack, Almost Alice . [60]

On 28 February, Lavigne gave a performance at the concert portion of the Vancouver 2010 Winter
Olympics closing ceremony , performing “My Happy Ending” and “Girlfriend”. [61]
Lavigne was honoured to perform at the ceremonies, but she regretted not being able to attend
the U.S. vs. Canada hockey match. “They had us on lockdown. We weren’t allowed to leave our
trailers, for security purposes.” [62]

In September 2010, Lavigne’s third single from her debut album, “I’m With You”, was
sampled by Rihanna on the track “ Cheers (Drink to That) “, which is featured on
Rihanna’s fifth studio album, Loud . [63] [64] In August 2011, she was featured in the music
video for Cheers (Drink To That). “It’s exciting to me because that was always one of my
favorite songs, and for it to come out 10 years ago and so now to have it sampled and back out on the
radio is pretty dope.” [65] In December 2010, American singer Miranda Cosgrove released
“ Dancing Crazy “, a song written by Lavigne, Max Martin and Shellback . It was also
produced by Martin. [66] On 23 September 2011, Lavigne appeared in the Hub network show Majors
& Minors as a guest mentor, alongside other singers including Adam Lambert and Leona Lewis .
About the show, Lavigne stated, “I sang for them, and they performed for me. I was just blown
away. I got to talk to them about music and the music industry, and they were all just so
excited.” [65]

The release dates for Goodbye Lullaby and its lead single were pushed back several times. In
response to these delays, Lavigne said, “I write my own music and, therefore, it takes me
longer to put out records ’cause I have to live my life to get inspiration.” [67] She also
said that she had enough material for two records. [67] In November, Lavigne was featured in
Maxim , where she revealed that Goodbye Lullaby took two and a half years to complete, [68] but
she cited her record company as the reason for the album’s delays, stating that the album had
been completed for a year. [69] Goodbye Lullaby was released on 8 March. [70] [57] The lead
single, “What the Hell”, premiered on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve on 31
December. [70]

2011â€“present: Fifth studio album



Three months after the release of Goodbye Lullaby , Lavigne announced that work on her fifth
studio album had already begun, with eight songs written so far. The new album will musically
be the opposite of Goodbye Lullaby , with a release date rumored for sometime in 2012. [71]
Lavigne explained, “[ Goodbye Lullaby ] was more mellow, [but] the next one will be pop and
more fun again. I already have a song that I know is going to be a single, I just need to re-record
it!” [72] [73] [74] Later, in July 2011, Lavigne revealed the title of two of the songs from
her fifth album as “Fine” and “Gone”. The tracks were originally recorded for
Goodbye Lullaby but never made the final cut. In late 2011, Lavigne confirmed that she had
moved to Epic Records , which is now headed by L.A. Reid . [75] [76]

Production-wise, Lavigne stated in an interview with Virgin Radio 96 that she would begin
production on the album in January 2012. [65] During recording, she has been confirmed to have
worked with the hip hop production duo The Runners , [77] Chad Kroeger of rock band Nickelback
and former member of rock band Evanescence David Hodges . [78] In April 2012, Lavigne
confirmed that she had “finally” finished work on her fifth album and that she would be
taking a short hiatus before releasing it and embarking on “[her] next artistic journey”

Musical style and songwriting



Avril Lavigne in February 2011.

Themes in Lavigne’s music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an
adolescent view. [79] Lavigne believes her “songs are about being yourself no matter what
and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they’re
never going to come true.” [80] On her debut album, Let Go , Lavigne preferred the less
mainstream songs, such as “ Losing Grip “, instead of her more radio-friendly singles,
such as “ Complicated “, saying that “the songs I did with the Matrix … were good for my
first record, but I don’t want to be that pop anymore.” [81] Lavigne’s second album,
Under My Skin , had deeper personal themes underlying each song. Lavigne explained,
“I’ve gone through so much, so that’s what I talk about…. Like boys, like dating or
relationships”. [82] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing , was not personal to
her. “Some of the songs I wrote didn’t even mean that much to me. It’s not like some
personal thing I’m going through.” [83] Her objective in writing the album was simply to
“make it fun”. [84] Goodbye Lullaby , Lavigne’s fourth album, was much more personal
than her earlier records, [55] with Lavigne describing the album as “more stripped down,
deeper. All the songs are very emotional”. [85] Ian McKellen defined her as â€œ… a
punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive
pugnacity of a Canadian.â€� on the Craig Ferguson show in 2007. [86] [87]

Growing up, Lavigne listened to Blink-182 , Goo Goo Dolls , Matchbox Twenty and Shania Twain ,
[81] and her influences include Courtney Love and Janis Joplin . [82] Because of these
influences, musical genres, and her personal style, the media often defined her as punk ,
something she denied being. Lavigneâ€™s close friend and guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld ,
said, “It’s a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn’t
punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and
the media ended up doing the rest”. [88] Lavigne also commented on the matter: “I have been
labeled like I’m this angry girl, [a] rebel… punk, and I am so not any of them.” [40]
â€œ I know my fans look up to me and that’s why I make my songs so personal; it’s all about
things I’ve experienced and things I like or hate. I write for myself and hope that my fans
like what I have to say.

â€�

â€”Avril Lavigne, Girl.com.au [80]

Most of critics identify Lavigne as some form between teen pop and pop-punk: Publications
such as The New York Times , Rolling Stone , NME , MusicMight , IGN and Popmatters have
identified Avril Lavigne as a mix of rock , teen pop and pop-punk , [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94]
influenced by a grungey pop-rock sound. [95] [96] [97] [98] [99]

While Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media’s
lack of respect for her songwriting. “I am a writer, and I won’t accept people trying to
take that away from me”, adding that she had been writing “full-structured songs”
since she was 14. [40] Despite this, Lavigneâ€™s songwriting has been questioned
throughout her career. The songwriting trio, the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for
her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigneâ€™s singles,
“Complicated”, “ Sk8er Boi ” and “ I’m with You “. Lavigne denied this,
asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album. “[N]one of those
songs aren’t from me”. [81] In 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk , who wrote with Lavigne on her
second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism [100] and criticized her songwriting. “Avril
doesn’t really sit and write songs by herself or anything”. [101] Lavigne also
disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for “clear
defamation” against her character. [101] Kreviazuk later apologized: “Avril is an
accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her”. [100] Shortly after
that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the 1970s band, the Rubinoos , sued Lavigne, her publishing
company, and Lukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of “I Wanna Be
Your Boyfriend” for her song “Girlfriend”. [102] Gottwald defended Lavigne,
stating, “me and Avril wrote the song togetherâ€Š. It has the same chord progressions
as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you’d find in a Sum 41 song. It’s
the Sex Pistols , not the Rubinoos.” [101] In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a
confidential settlement had been reached. [103]

Other work



Film career



Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she
said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos would be to her
advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on
camera. She specifically mentioned that the video “Nobody’s Home” involved the most
“acting”. [80] Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of Sabrina, the
Teenage Witch , [104] performing “Sk8er Boi” [105] with her band in a nightclub. [106] She
later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film Going the Distance . The main characters bump
into her backstage at the MuchMusic Video Awards [107] after her performance of “Losing
Grip”. [108]

She moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin
with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to
New Mexico [109] to film a single scene in the 2007 film, The Flock . [110] She starred as
Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and
Richard Gere . Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes. [110] On her role in The Flock ,
Lavigne said, “I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too
fast”. [80] The Flock would not be released in American theatres, and because it would not be
released in foreign markets until late 2007, it would not be considered Lavigne’s debut.
The film made $7Â million in the foreign box office. [111]

Lavigne’s feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film Over the
Hedge , based on the comic strip of the same name . She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia
Opossum . Recording the characters’ voices was devoid of interaction with other actors.
Lavigne stated, “All the actors went in individually, and [director] Tim and
[screenwriter Karey ] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go
so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable…. That was the interesting part, going in by
yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.” [112] Lavigne found the recording process
to be “easy” and “natural”, but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while
acting. “I’d use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises,
so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still…. It’s hard to be running or falling down the
stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.” Lavigne
believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. “[The director]
thought I’d give my character… a bit of attitude”. [80] The film opened on 19 May 2006,
making $38Â million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336Â million
worldwide. [113]

In December 2005, Lavigne signed on to appear in Fast Food Nation , based on the book Fast Food
Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal . [114] The fictionalized adaptation,
directed by Richard Linklater , traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces
back to the slaughterhouses. [115] Lavigne starred in her on-screen acting debut [116] as a
high school student intent on freeing the cows. [117] The film opened on 17 November 2006 and
remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2Â million worldwide. [118]

Both Over the Hedge and Fast Food Nation opened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival , which Lavigne
attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she
would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the
“right parts and the right movies.” Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. “I
wanted to start off small and to learn [that] I wouldn’t just want to throw myself into a big
part.” [80] In August 2006, Canadian Business magazine ranked her as the seventh top
Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The
results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.
[119]

Fashion design



In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line Abbey Dawn , featuring a back-to-school
collection. [12] It is produced by Kohl’s , which is the brand’s exclusive U.S. retailer.
Named after Lavigne’s childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.
[120] [121] Kohl’s describes Abbey Dawn as a “juniors lifestyle brand”, [12] which
incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and “hot pinks and blacks”.
Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before
its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection.
“I actually am the designer. What’s really important to me is that everything fits well
and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.” [122] The clothing line
incorporates Lavigne’s musical style and lyrics, “after the release of my first album, I
realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career”. [65] â€œ I just love
clothes and colors and patterns. I’m very visual and very hands-on.

â€�

â€”Avril Lavigne, Billboard [123]

The designs were also featured on the Internet game Stardoll , where figures can be dressed up
as Avril Lavigne. [124] On 14 September 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her
clothing line to be a part of the New York Fashion Week , [125] returning in 2011. [65] In
December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line’s
official website. [126] [85] “It’s fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I’d
like for myself. I design things I [can't] find.” [62] At the end of 2008, Lavigne signed a
contract with Canon Canada to appear in advertising campaigns and commercials to promote the
latest line of cameras and a full range of other accessories. [127]

Lavigne released her first fragrance, Black Star , created by Procter & Gamble Prestige
Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne’s official website on 7 March 2009. Black
Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in
summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada. [128] When asked what the name meant,
Lavigne replied, “I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and
Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the
stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it’s okay to be unique and
be who you are.” [129] Black Star won the 2010 Best “Women’s Scent Mass” by Cosmetic
Executive Women (CEW). [130] Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, [131]
Forbidden Rose , which took two years to develop. [132] It features notes of red apple,
winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement,
sandalwood, and vanilla. [131] Its message is an extension of Black Star’s “follow your
dreams”, [133] though the tagline for the new perfume is “Dare to Discover”. [134] The
commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting, [133] where Lavigne, upon entering the
garden, finds a single, purple rose. [134] Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in
August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. [85] The tagline for the fragrance is
“Dare to discover more”. [135] It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum,
orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crÃšme brÃ»lÃ©e.
[136]

In January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate Alice in Wonderland
-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing. [58] Her designs were exhibited at the
Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in California beginning in May through
September, alongside Colleen Atwood ‘s costumes from the 2010 film. [137]

Philanthropy



Lavigne has been involved with many charities, including Make Some Noise, Amnesty
International , Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, Camp Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields,
U.S. Campaign for Burma , Make-a-Wish Foundation and War Child . She has also appeared in ALDO
ads with YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne took
part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of Unicef on 28 November
2007 at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. [138] In November 2010, Lavigne attended
the Clinton Global Initiative . [139]

Lavigne worked with Reverb , a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east
coast tour. [140] She covered “ Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door ” for War Child’s Peace
Songs compilation, and she recorded a cover of the John Lennon song “ Imagine ” as her
contribution to the compilation album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to
Save Darfur . Released on 12 June 2007, the album was produced to benefit Amnesty
International ‘s campaign to alleviate the crisis in Darfur . [141]

On 5 December 2009, Lavigne returned to the stage in Mexico City during the biggest charity
event in Latin America, “ Teleton “. She performed acoustic versions of her hits
“Complicated” and “Girlfriend” with Evan Taubenfeld and band member, Jim McGorman
. [142] In 2010, Lavigne was one of several artists who contributed their voices to a cover of
K’naan ‘s “Wavin’ Flag” as a benefit single to help raise money for several charity
organizations related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. [143]

On 14 September 2010, Lavigne introduced her charity, “The Avril Lavigne Foundation”.
The next day, the foundation’s official website was launched. The foundation aims to help
young people with serious illnesses and disabilities [139] [144] and works with leading
charitable organizations; [126] The foundation partners with the Easter Seals ,
Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS, [145] the latter two being charities Lavigne has
previously worked with. Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind
her own charity, with Lavigne stating, “I just really wanted to do more”. [144] Lavigne
said on the foundation’s website, “I have always looked for ways to give back because I
think itâ€™s a responsibility we all share”. [146] Philanthropist Trevor
Neilson’s 12-person firm, “ Global Philanthropy Group “, advises Lavigne with her
foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician John Legend . [139]

Personal life



Public image

â€œ I have to fight to keep my image really me …. I rejected some gorgeous publicity shots
because they just didn’t look like me. I won’t wear skanky clothes that show my booty, my
belly or my boobs. I have a great body.

â€�

â€”Avril Lavigne, MTV [5]

When Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her tomboyish style, [147] in
particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. [148] [149] She preferred baggy
clothes, skater shoes or Converses , [62] wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped
around her fingers. [7] During photo shoots, instead of wearing “glittery get-ups”, she
preferred wearing “old, crumpled T’s”. [5] In response to her fashion and musical
influences, the media would call her the “ pop punk princess “. [150] [151] Press and fans
regarded her as the “anti-Britney” , in part because of her less commercial and
“real” image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. “Iâ€™m not made up
and Iâ€™m not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the
anti-Britney, which Iâ€™m not.” [7] By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped
wearing ties, claiming she felt she was “wearing a costume”. [6] Lavigne made a conscious
effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. “I’m just
saying, I don’t want to sell sex. I feel that’s sort of lame and low. I’ve got so much more
to say.” [152]

Lavigne eventually took on a more gothic style as she began her second album, Under My Skin ,
trading her skating outfits for black tutus [151] and earning an image marked by angst . [153]
During The Best Damn Thing years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a
pink streak, wore feminine outfits, [154] including “tight jeans and heels”, [62] and
modelled for magazines such as Harper’s Bazaar . [147] Lavigne defended her new style: “I
don’t really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all… It had its
time and place. And now I’m all grown up, and I’ve moved on”. [154] She now tries to eat
healthy foods and practises yoga, soccer, surfing, rollerblading, and street hockey. [62]

Tattoos



Only a few of Lavigne’s tattoos are unique to her; the rest are matched with those of her
friends. [62] Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the
same time as friend and musical associate Ben Moody ‘s identical tattoo. [155] In late 2004,
she had a small pink heart around the letter “D” applied to her right wrist, which
represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley. [62] [156] Lavigne and then-husband
Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday. [62] In
April, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist: that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.
[157] â€œ Everything is always spur-of-the-moment. All of my tattoos, I decide that
second and do it.

â€�

â€”Avril Lavigne, Inked [62]

Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and Jenner
each got matching tattoos of the word “fuck” on their ribs. [158] [159] Lavigne appeared
in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine , where she discussed and showed off her
tattoos, including an “Abbey Dawn” on her left forearm and an “XXV” and star on her
right. Although she confirmed the “fuck” tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her
“favorite word” [62] ) she had it applied after the magazine’s photo shoot. [160] She
added that she eventually wanted to get a “big-ass heart with a flag through it with a
name…. I’m going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that
special someone to come back into my life.” [62] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend’s
name, “Brody”, tattooed beneath her right breast. [161] The couple announced that they
broke up in January 2012. [162]

Marriage to Deryck Whibley



 

 

Lavigne’s ex-husband, Deryck Whibley

Lavigne and Deryck Whibley , lead singer and guitarist for the band Sum 41 , began dating when
she was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17. [163] Only a few weeks before they
met, Lavigne admitted that she was not meeting boys because her bodyguards were frightening
them away. In June 2005, Whibley surprised Lavigne with a trip to Venice , including a gondola
ride and a romantic picnic, and on 27 June, he proposed to her. [164]

She at first wanted to have a “rock n’ roll, goth wedding”, but she admitted to having
doubts about going against tradition. “I’ve been dreaming about my wedding day since I
was a little girl. I have to wear the white dress…. People thought that I would [wear a] black
wedding dress, and I would have. But at the same time, I was thinking about the wedding
pictures, and I wanted to be in style. I didn’t want to be thinking, 20 years later, ‘Oh, why
did I wear my hair like that?’” [165]

The wedding was held on 15 July 2006. About 110 guests attended the wedding, which was held at a
private estate in Montecito, California . [166] Lavigne, wearing a gown designed by Vera Wang
walked down the aisle with her father, Jean-Claude, to Mendelssohn ‘s “ Wedding March
“. Lavigne chose a colour theme of red and white, including red rose petals and centrepieces
of distinctly coloured flowers. The wedding included cocktails for an hour before the
reception and a sit-down dinner. The song “ Iris “, by the Goo Goo Dolls , was played during
Lavigne and Whibley’s first dance. [167]

Seven months into their marriage, Lavigne stated that she was “the best thing that’s ever
happened to him”, and suggested that she helped Whibley stay off drugs since they had begun
dating. “He doesn’t do drugs. Clearly, he used to, because he talked about it, but I
wouldn’t be with someone who did, and I made that very clear to him when we first started
dating. I’ve never done cocaine in my life, and I’m proud of that. I am 100 percent against
drugs.” [165] The marriage lasted a little more than three years. It was announced on 17
September 2009 that Lavigne and Whibley had split up and that divorce papers would soon
follow. [168] On 9 October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, “I am
grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining
friendship.” [163] The divorce was finalized on 16 November 2010, officially ending the
marriage. [169]

{Mei 6, 2012}   Jessi Slaughter having a sexual relationship with Dahvie Vanity?

An 11-year old girl calling herself Jessi Slaughter had an emotional breakdown on YouTube
late last week. Nothing new, right? This story has generated a lot of buzz because although
everyone can agree that the whole situation sucks, no one is exactly sure who is to blame.

Her original uploads, which featured her declaring how she was better/prettier/more
popular than everyone on the internet, have been taken down, but the internet is keeping them
alive.

Trolls from prank-loving 4chan, the Tumblr blog network and elsewhere allegedly sent pizza
deliveries and considered sending call girls to her house and bombarded her social network
profiles with hateful comments.

Jessi, bewildered and hysterical, posted two response videos, which caught on mostly
because her father peppered the footage with instantly meme-worthy empty threats like
“You done goofed” and “Consequences will never be the same” and claimed that
offenders had been “back-traced” by the “cyber police.”

Her father’s helplessness and amusing lack of understanding of how the internet works only
fueled the trolls’ desire to further inflict pain on Jessi’s family. One troll called
Jessi’s home, posing as the police .

So that’s the short version. Now let’s go back to the beginning and see what led this
11-year-old girl to tell strangers to shoot themselves in the heads, and whose fault this
whole thing is.

We now know Jessi had also posted nude and suggestive photos of herself on Facebook and
allegedly elsewhere. There is also a bizarre side-story here involving the singer of an emo
band called Blood on the Dance Floor who goes by the stage name Dahvie Vanity. Know Your Meme
reports that someone accused Jessi of having a sexual relationship with Dahvie, and Jessi
quickly refuted these claims. A police report has now surfaced regarding rape accusations
involving Dahvie.

At some point, Jessi became aware that she now had “haters.” So she posted a NSFW video in
response.

But the drama was just picking up. She was upset by all the “hate” left in her videos’
comments that she posted a tearful video explaining how her haters were ruining her life. Her
dad chimed in too, threatening to report YouTube users to the cyber police.

Of course, all of this crying and moaning came after a video explaining that she couldn’t
care less about what people were saying on the internet.

The internet has turned this thing into a meme in under 24 hours, with dozens of photoshops and
remixes. Know Your Meme has a comprehensive gallery .

Anyway, Jessi did what any sane person would do, and closed her YouTube account. We thought
this would put an end to everything. Finally, her parents made the right decision to stop
engaging with the trolls. As of this morning, Jessi has been placed under police protection .
When Gawker talked to Jessi’s mom, she said, “I haven’t seen it,” she says. “I
don’t even go on the computer.” Which might be part of the problem!

The best you can do in a case like this is delete everything, stay off the internet for a while and
hope that the trolls will get bored and move on to the next target. 4chan has a long tradition of
simultaneously celebrating and vilifying annoying “cam-girls” like Boxxybabe ,
Lexibee and now Jessi Slaughter, for the same reasons that any group of young bored guys would
pick on weird annoying girls offline.

In an excellent Gawker piece about the scandal , Adrien Chen provides a few takeaway lessons.
Here’s one:

â€œDon’t pick on 11 year-old girls. Seriously. No matter how dumb they seem-no matter
how much they might seem to deserve it-they are, at the end of the day, 11 year-old girls. You
wouldn’t make an 11 year-old girl cry in real life; why do it on the Internet?â€�

I see where Adrien is coming from here. Who would excuse the scum who tracked down a child’s
home address?

But at the same time, internet trolling is a constant. If given the opportunity, people will
always be awful on the internet. Decrying the trolls is sort of like decrying a gang of thugs who
mugged a guy wandering dark alleys wearing a suit made of hundred dollar bills. The girl was
posting suggestive photos of herself, threatening people who posted nasty comments about
her videos and taunting her bullies. In other words, this girl was inviting it. This doesn’t
excuse the harassers , but no one would have come after her if she hadn’t been acting wildly
inappropriate for an eleven-year-old girl.

Only eleven and posting nudes and threats online! Which is why the real failure here lies
squarely on Mom and Dad’s shoulders. All 11-year-olds are idiots. When given the power of a
worldwide platform to exhibit their vanity, they’ll take it. Kids with unfettered
internet access need parents who understand how the internet works.

Mom Logic talked with Jessi’s mom , who had this to say:

â€œCommunicate with your child, try and watch them and try and believe what your child is
saying to you. Give your child the benefit of the doubt, because nobody else will. And talk to
your child about cyberbullying and about how bad it’s going to hurt another person. They
don’t know or understand the dwindling-down effect of what they’ve created.â€�

That’s her takeaway? I feel like the lesson here should be that you shouldn’t give your
child the benefit of the doubt and just assume that they’re probably up to no good online. How
much time would it take to buzz through the browser history once a week?

And it’s not just girls like Jessi. A lot of these trolls are underage too, and many of them
have little to no relationship with 4chan, the seedy underbelly of the internet that often
gets blamed when this kind of exploitation takes place online. 4chan’s users are hardly a
homogenous group, and most of them are harmless. The vast majority of 4chan users never
touched this story. Same for Tumblr, where some of Jessi’s other harassers hang out.

Take this kid for instance. Where are his parents, and how will they react when their son
can’t get a job someday because he was an idiot on the internet when he was 14?

 

The Atlantic’s Alexis Madrigal is sympathetic to the parents’ reaction. He did a great
job of explaining what must have been going through Dad’s head:

…this father tried to protect his daughter from the pain the world can inflict. As she sat
crying in the foreground, he kneeled behind her and roared into a webcam at the nameless,
faceless forces who had reduced his daughter to tears.

â€œBut you know, there was a time when these kinds of threats worked, and maybe it was a good
thing. Words like that from a dad just might put a scare into some cruel 13-year-olds on a
mission to ruin some kid’s life for fun. In the old days, dads could handle harassment of
their little girls. They’d pick up the phone line and yell at prank callers. They’d show up
at schools and tell some kids to back off.â€�

Madrigal says this strategy can’t work when the kids are completely anonymous and
attacking from anywhere in the world. So what should parents do to prevent this from happening
to their children, and if it does happen, how should they react to prevent some freak from
showing up at their house in a V for Vendetta mask ? Stay tuned for our how-to guide.

{Mei 6, 2012}   Dahvie Vanity

The name Dahvie Vanity is uttered on the lips of most sex-crazed and music-loving teens,
quickly becoming a household name. Following the trends of such internet celebrities as
Jeffree Star and Matthew Lush, the number of friends on his personal, public and band MySpace
profiles grows prolifically each day. But who is this guy?

Dahvie Vanity is the frontman of the increasingly popular electronic band â€˜Blood on
the Dancefloorâ€™. His scene aesthetic and sex appeal is demonstrated through the
music and identifies with teens around the globe. Both Dahvie and his music are fittingly
described as glam.

Not only is he in a band, but he is a Tigi trained hairdresser, with the ability to cut, dye and
style hair. Additionally he fashions clip-in hair extensions and advertises both his
services and products on his public MySpace page. It is this that has earned him the alias of
â€˜Elite Hair Godâ€™.

Dahvie has not allowed internet stardom to spoil him, remaining very fan-oriented.
Regularly does he post bulletins and blog entries addressed to the fans and replies to a lot of
the fan mail that he receives. Despite the controversiality portrayed about his person,
Dahvie remains friendly, down-to-earth and glamorous.

{April 6, 2012}   andy sixx (Black Veil Brides)

Here is an article that is going to tell you facts and opinions from people that you should know
about the famous celebrity Andy Sixx , from the band the “ Black Veil Brides “. His real name
is “ Dennis Biersack ” to be exact and all. His dad was the person that gave him the name that
he uses throughout his career and band.

Andy Sixx, has many talents even ones you wouldn`t expect from a lead singer. He plays the bass
guitar, the keyboard (Piano) and even sings. Now, Andy six or if you want to call him by his real
name “Dennis Biersack” can also Scream while singing in his songs. This was shown in some
of his songs like “knives and pens” and “perfect weapons” more than his other newer
songs like “the Legacy”.

Most people would say that Andy Sixx had become famous due to the internet. Now, the question is
from somewhere but where? Was it YouTube? Facebook? Twitter? Well, it was from a mix of things
but mostly from MySpace. MySpace was known before Facebook and overall created before it as
well. Andy six, had taken over 75 photos and put them on MySpace when MySpace was somewhat new.
This caused people to see who he was. The girls loved the way he looked.

YouTube was a big contributor for Andy sixx as an individual and the black veil brides when
starting up and becoming famous. Andy six, had started a simple vlog (video Blog) and made many
fans from it. He kept them short and very funny, the girl fans would make comments on how nice his
short/scene hair cut would look and how he had amazing bright blue eyes. These things got
people`s attention, his looks, his funny personalities and his smile (what the girls would
say). Andy sixx is also known for his “ Andy Sixx Hair “

They said that Andy Six was bullied as a teenager because he dressed as selective way like an emo
with black hair and painted figure nails. This is what inspired him to try and send out his
message with the “Black Veil Bride”. Andy six, at a young age decided to lose weight this
was shown in one of their songs called “Knifes and pens”.

Andy six was born a small town in Milwaukee- Wisconsin and was known for being the
“outcast” throughout his life and school career`s. They say that Andy 6, was a character
created to hide himself from the dangers of the world. This gave him strength within himself
and now he is trying to show everyone that the only person standing in the way is yourself and you
can overcome this at any time. His parents’ names are Amy and Chris. There is a growing fan
base for Andy 6 and the Black Veil Brides it will soon become something like the band “kiss”
and other rock and roll leagues.
