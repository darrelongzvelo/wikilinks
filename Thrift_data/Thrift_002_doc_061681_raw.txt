Making the Choice Between Money and Meaning



Umair Haque 3 Oct 2012, 2:00 pm CEST



Remind me: why is an average investment banker is worth, say, a hundred times as much as an
average teacher? And why does a top hedge fund manager "earn" enough to pay for thousands of
teachers?

Is there a trade-off between meaning and money? And if there is, how does one master â€”
and perhaps â€” resolve it? Can it be resolved?

There is indeed a stark, sharp, gigantic trade-off between meaning and money in our so-called
brain-dead shell-game Ponzi-scheme of an "economy."

But there shouldn't be.

In a "working" economy, one should gain a sense of meaning from one's work when one makes a
lasting, visible difference; and when one makes a difference, one should be rewarded for (and
in proportion with) it. Now, in the name of dynamism and accomplishment, one probably
shouldn't be guaranteed a fortune doing what one loves; I don't suggest that every wannabe
Hemingway and Picasso should be raking in the bucks like a mega-banker. But the fact that it
seems nearly impossible to build a stable, secure, happy life in the segment formerly known as
the "middle class" by doing worthwhile work that makes a real human difference is the
exception that proves the rule, illuminating just how deeply, and perhaps fatally broken our
economy is.

You and I face the difficult choice of trading meaning for money; we weigh the searing moments
of real human accomplishment against the soul-sucking "work" of earning the next car payment
by polishing up another meaningless PowerPoint deck packed with tactics to win games whose
net result is the creation of little of real value for much of anyone who's not a sociopath. This
is the deepest kind of theft; not merely prosperity having been looted from societies, but
significance having been stolen from human lives.

Yet, the unforgiving truth is: the trade-off between meaning and money is as real â€” and
as toxic, as characteristic of our post-prosperity present, and as strikingly intensifying
â€” as climate change. And, like climate change, while you can argue that it's existed
throughout history, to do so is a weak argument; so has, say, human trafficking.

In the simplest sense, the very point of a "capitalist" economy is to minimize the trade-off
between meaning and money. So, for example, you and I don't have to spend a lifetime building,
stone by stone, a Great Wall or a Pyramid â€” to satisfy the whim of an Emperor or a Pharaoh
â€” and so burn through our one invaluable precious life. Every life has worth; and
because it has worth, so it must seek, and discover, meaning.

So what can you do about it? There's only one good answer, and it's simple. Stop trading meaning
for money. It's the worst trade you'll ever make. But the truth is, you and I are encouraged to
make the worst trade in the world from the second we're socialized â€” from school
"counselors" who exhort us to settle for the safe; to schlock-and-awe advertising that
lamely attempts to brainwash us into buying our way out of emptiness and self-loathing; to
"jobs" that reward us for extinguishing what's good, noble, and true in us. Perhaps it's no
exaggeration, in short, to suggest: our way of work, life, and play revolves around hundreds
of millions of people, billions of times a day, trading meaning for money â€” so, of
course, the next hour, day, week, and money, they can furiously, eagerly, desperately spend
large amounts of money trying to buy tiny morsels of meaning.

Consider, for a moment, what noted economist Richard Easterlin has recently found : that as
China has gotten notably richer, its happiness has followed a U-shaped curve: first
declining, then ascending â€” but never ascending past its previous, historic,
poverty-ridden peaks. While I don't pretend societies should be held hostage to "happiness"
as the only end of life â€” to be sure, a full, rich life is in every sense larger and wholer
than a merely happy one â€” perhaps this now-familiar research demonstrates a truth
that I'd bet, deep down, most of us don't just know , but feel, live, and breathe: that while
we've become proficient at attaining riches, while the pursuit of material wealth is now
something like the application of a well-worn formula, living lives rich not just with
megabucks, but with meaning remains elusive, enigmatic, difficult .

And yet a life without meaning is like a day that never breaks.

But when I say, "stop trading meaning for money", I emphatically don't mean we should do the
opposite: start trading money for meaning. Instead, we must detonate this toxic trade-off
â€” for while it might not irreparably poison our lives, it surely will diminish,
reduce, and wither the worth of our limitless potential.

Step out of your shadow, the carefully constructed almost-self you've been instructed,
encouraged, cajoled to settle for. In this big-box store of the human spirit, the only choices
on offer are money or meaning. You can be the jet-setting exec (banker, trader, technocrat)
with a soul as deadened as the waning arctic winter â€” or the underpaid teacher (artist,
writer, designer) struggling to reach the high summer of prosperity. It's up to you not just to
reject and refuse those dilemma-ridden choices â€” but to rebel against them and forge
better opportunities; above all, the opportunities that make up a life worth living; the
stuff of eudaimonia â€” a life that matters because it's been lived meaningfully well.

This is what the unbending arc of human potential never stops asking of each and every one of us.
Stop trading money for meaning. Start blowing up the dilemma by investing money â€” and
much more significantly, time, energy, attention, relationships, imagination, and
passion â€” in the stuff of a life meaningfully well lived. Any fool with an empty wallet,
a gimlet eye, and an emptier head can sell his soul; just as any dilettante can trade meaning for
money, and glorify themselves as a starving artist. The greater challenge in any life isn't
merely extracting the highest price for your soul; nor safeguarding your soul while
opportunities pass you by â€” but earning, with the coin of mattering, a life that has
counted in the terms that make us not merely "rich", but whole, worthy of the privilege of
having lived .

Let me put that in real-world terms.

You're 25. You're finally offered a job at the corporobotic blue-chip institution your less
interesting acquaintances have always dreamt of working at. Turn it down. Start the next
Kickstarter instead.

You're 35. You're finally offered the big jump to VP. Take it â€” and then damn your first
year's bonus, make your first major project redesigning a product line that matters.

You're 45. You're sidelined. Quit. Start something that makes you feel something again.

You're 55. You're fired. Don't panic. Use your wisdom; mentor, coach, teach, lead.

Let me put that even more simply. You're going to need to apply not just the following
professional skills â€” entrepreneurship; "networking," pluck and drive, strategic
thinking, leadership, branding and marketing â€” but also the following human
capacities: a stubborn refusal to obey the dictates of the status quo , an unwavering empathy,
a healthy disrespect for the naysayers, the humility of the servant and the pride of the master
artisan, a persevering sense of grace, a heaping spoonful of that most dangerously
unpredictable of substances, love , and, finally, the unflinching belief in a better
tomorrow that those have always had who dust their saddles off, dig their spurs in, and forge
ahead into the great unknown.

One day, in the far-flung future, our so-called not-really-leaders-in-anything-but-name
might get their act together and begin to patch up this clapped out, wheezing train wreck of a
so-called economy. So that there's not a sharp, painful trade off between meaning and money;
so that bankers don't earn hundreds of times what teachers do. It's not, after all, rocket
science â€” jiggle GDP; juggle taxes and subsidies; break up the monoliths â€”
hey, presto: an "economy" in which material wealth roughly, crudely lines up with meaning; in
which "profit" reflects real human benefit delivered (instead of how many towns and lives
you've looted this quarter).

Until that day, the simple fact is: right here, right now, there's a trade-off between meaning
and money. And maybe, right back to the days of the first pyramids, ziggurats, and fortresses,
there always has been â€” and perhaps, right up to the days when humankind flits finally
between the luminous galaxies, there always will be. And so: your challenge is, perhaps, one
as ageless as stone, and as human as love. Forging a life â€” in the crucible of
possibility â€” in which there isn't.

Originally posted in The Technium

If you want to build a ship, donâ€™t drum up people together to collect wood and
donâ€™t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless
immensity of the sea. â€” Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, a very loose English paraphrase
of his French poem Dessine-moi un bateau, or Make Me a Boat, found in Citadelle, 1948 .

You say, "Why should I learn these difficult technical skills when it's all just gonna change?
Let me know when it's settled down." Problem is, by the time you catch on that it's *never* gonna
settle down, you're five years behind, with no real way to catch up, and you feel like a
one-person Soviet Union. -- Stewart Brand, on the WELL, about 1991

The ultraintelligent machine â€Š is a machine that believes people cannot think. -- Jack

A history of the entertainment business could be framed as a series of experts asking,
â€œWho the hell wants to watch that?â€� When the answer is â€œmore people than

If you are able-bodied and you see a person in front of you walk into the path of an oncoming car,
you have a responsibility to pull that person to safety. But, in a world in which we can know what

burdened with? -- Esyher Dyson, Technology's Mental Frontier, Aug 21, 2012

Demographic curves are very hard to bend. -- Jonathan Haidt, He Knows Why We Fight, Wall Street
Journal, June 29, 2012

You see, a wire telegraph is a kind of very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his
head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand? Radio operates in exactly the same way. The
only difference is that there is no cat. -- Old joke, starting in 1866 (!), Quote Investigator,
February 24, 2012

The young, multibillionaire technologist is left with only two avocations: space travel and
the engineering of immortality. Both are about escaping the gravity of the situation. -- Nick
Carr, Rough Type, Farmville, May 8, 2012

Some quite natural events -- hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, derechos -- have such
unimaginable power that the destruction they wreak will always take days, or weeks, or months
to fix. No society can afford to harden the infrastructure that supports it to make that
infrastructure immune to such destructive forces. (Sometimes it makes more sense to spend
money on mitigation than it does to spend it on prevention.) -- Randy Baum, C&EN, July 16, 2012

Parkinson's Law of Triviality states that, "the time spent on any item of the agenda will be in
inverse proportion to the sum involved." In other words, if you try to build a simple thing such
as a public bike shed, there will be endless town hall discussions wherein people argue over
trivial details such as the color of the door. But if you want to build a nuclear power plant
â€” a project so vast and complicated that most people can't understand it â€”
people will defer to expert opinion. -- C. Northcote Parkinson, 1957, Parkinson's Law.

A fact is a simple statement that everyone believes. It is innocent, unless found guilty. A
hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe. It is guilty, until found
effective. -- Edward Teller, Conversations on the Dark Secrets of Physics , 1991, p. 69
footnote.

The â€œuncanny valleyâ€� is a term coined by roboticist Masahiro Mori to describe
the revulsion people experience when seeing robots that look and act almost, but not exactly,

than any human salesperson, and theyâ€™re just smart enough to make you queasy. --

The Free Syrian Army deploys kittens, the ultimate Internet PR weapon



...My heart's in Accra 5 Sep 2012, 11:19 pm CEST



FSA Kittens is a tumblr blog dedicated to celebrating the kittens fighting to overcome the
Assad regime in Syria. The dozen or so posts range from the documentary to the deeply whimsical
:



Image: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m99n6xabBc1rdw61fo1_400.jpg This FSA
kitten, Yasmeen, is on sniper-duty. Yasmeenâ€™s commander shared with FSA Kittens
Yasmeenâ€™s sniper log for August 23rd:

8:30 am: Two regime soldiers observed marching a young child at gunpoint. Range: 500 meters. 2
shots fired. Both regime soldiers killed. Child ran free.

11:00 am: Conducted deep infiltration behind-enemy-lines. Identified Iranian
Revolutionary Guard officer among regime troops. Range: 250 meters. 1 shot fired. IRG
officer killed. Successfully evaded patrols and returned-to-base.

At first, this looks like confirmation that the Internet is made of cats . (See also the
Internet Defense Leagueâ€™s Cat Signal , the Cute Cat Theory and Googleâ€™s
experiments with cat-detecting AI .) But thereâ€™s slightly more than meets the eye.

An August 8th article in The Guardian by Martin Chulov focused on ferocious fighting in
Salahedin, but included some paragraphs that paint a vivid picture of life in the besieged
city:

Street 15 in Salahedin now resembles Leningrad in its darkest days, and the suburb itself is in
far worse shape than when the Guardian last visited on Saturday. Most streets on the eastern
side are now impassable by car. Broken sewage and water pipes and food leftovers have formed a
festering stew over the few surfaces that arenâ€™t littered with the flotsam and jetsam
of war. And Salahedin has a new arrival â€“ flies, which swarm around anything organic.
They are so thick in some parts that rebels look for detours to avoid them. As they do they need to
avoid trampling on the only other thing that seems to be living at ground zero of the battle for
Syria â€“ kittens.

Rebels have taken in many of them, and itâ€™s not uncommon to find a gnarled, sweaty
guerrilla sleeping on the floor of a commandeered flat with an abandoned kitten asleep on his
chest.

Two men sleeping in what passes for a first aid clinic in one part of Salahedin had to throw their
new pets aside late on Wednesday, when a wounded rebel appeared like a ghost in their darkened
doorway. He fell on a foam mattress clutching his left side. â€œA sniper, haram,â€�
he said. â€œI was going to meet the defector.â€�

Who doesnâ€™t love a freedom fighter who sleeps with a stray kitten on his chest?
Probably folks like Peter Beaumont, who warns that we need to pay attention to war crimes
perpetrated by the FSA as well as those carried out by the Assad regime. Or commenter on the
article, JoshRogan , who notes that â€œFar from being reported, the rebels are being
shown literally as kitten-loving good boys, while anyone who supports the government is akin
to a Nazi.â€�

In other words, even cute cats have politics.

If you were trying to get people to pay attention to the conflict in Syria, which fights for
media attention against the US elections, you could do worse than to recruit a few kittens to
the cause. The emergence of figures like Wael Ghonim as focal points for the Tahrir Square
protesters helped a global audience relate to the thousands of protesters trying to
overthrow the Mubarak regime. Itâ€™s been harder to identify the â€œfaceâ€�
of the Syrian civil war. Perhaps that face has whiskers? Permalink

TSA Pre-Check, Fairness and Opaque Algorithms



...My heart's in Accra 5 Sep 2012, 10:40 pm CEST



Running late for a flight from Boston to San Francisco today, I was delighted to discover that
my boarding pass made me eligible for the â€œ TSA Pre-âˆš â€� line. Instead of
waiting in a labyrinthine line, removing my bottles of shampoo, my shoes and my laptop, I found
myself as the only person waiting to use the metal detector, with TSA agents assuring me that I
could simply take my phone out of my pocket, leave my bags on the conveyer belt and step through.
It took less than 30 seconds to clear security. It felt great. And it felt like cheating.

I fly about 100,000 miles a year, mostly with Delta, so Iâ€™m just shy of Deltaâ€™s
highest tier of frequent fliers. Some months ago, Delta offered me the option of sharing my
frequent flier status with the TSA, in order to expedite security checks. Unlike programs
like Clear, which requires a substantial annual fee, a special ID card and biometric scans of
flyerâ€™s retinas, opting into this program was free and involved selecting a
checkbox. I opted in, and promptly forgot about it, until checking into a flight at Detroit a
few months ago, I found myself invited into the Pre-âˆš line and whisked through security.
It was surprising, weird and pleasant â€“ I thought about tweeting about how pleasant
the experience was, until I realized that I was also pretty uncomfortable with a system that
seemed to provide such unequal treatment for frequent flyers and occasional travelers.

The logic behind Pre-âˆš is pretty straightforward. Iâ€™ve flown a lot in the past
two decades, and havenâ€™t threatened the safety of passenger, plane or crew â€“
if we project future behavior based on past behavior, I look pretty unlikely to smuggle
dangerous items onto a plane. TSA has limited resources to passengers, so they should focus on
the unfamiliar, who are less predictable and more threatening. And since frequent travelers
experience the most frustration with TSA delays, changing their experience with security
procedures is likely to have the most impact on perceptions of the TSA and their function.

But there are some unexpected consequences in making security more pleasant for frequent
travelers. Bruce Schneierâ€™s observation that most airport security measures
represent â€œsecurity theatreâ€� rather than actual security enhancements
â€“ like reinforced cockpit doors â€“ comes into very sharp relief when your
shampoo no longer needs special scrutiny, and your shoes are assumed to be explosive-free.
Itâ€™s harder to tolerate the petty rules that govern flight security â€“
â€œSir, Iâ€™m throwing out your toothpaste because the tube once held 125ml, and
though itâ€™s obvious itâ€™s almost entirely empty, the rules say that anything
over 100ml canâ€™t fly, so good luck brushing your teeth tonightâ€� â€“ when
itâ€™s made abundantly clear that theyâ€™re completely arbitrary, largely
disconnected from actual security threats and enforced as public performance.
Thereâ€™s an odd cognitive dissonance in having the TSA abandon security theatre so
totally â€“ while I know the rules that have just been waived are arbitrary and
ineffective, I find myself experiencing brief anxiety at realizing that the rules have been
relaxed for me and others who fit some unknown sort of profile. (More on that in a moment.)

There are a variety of reasons to be discomfited by Pre-âˆš. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader
notes that splitting the security experience into a smooth one for frequent travelers and a
harsh one for infrequent fliers suggests that weâ€™re unlikely to loosen travel
restrictions across the board. Frequent fliers are the people most likely to complain about
TSA procedures and push for reform, and if theyâ€™re accommodated separately,
political pressure to reduce security theatre is lessened. â€œThe only thing that has
developed tolerance for this mass nonsense that is going on at the T.S.A. checkpoints is that
everybody is supposed to be exposed to itâ€Š. Once that is shattered there is going to be a
lot of resentment among those who watch others zip through while we wait and nudge forward and
get shouted at to take our shoes off.â€�

Heâ€™s right, which is probably why the two Pre-âˆš lines Iâ€™ve been through
are physically separated from the normal TSA screening area â€“ I know Iâ€™m
getting the light treatment, but the infrequent travelers donâ€™t, and the security
theatre is for them, after all. So long as Iâ€™m treated well, I have no incentive to lobby
for change, and if the infrequent fliers canâ€™t see my experience, they wonâ€™t
know how arbitrary and unnecessary the procedures theyâ€™re going through are. Long
security lines could be a source of solidarity, but we lose that possibility when frequent
travelers get special privileges. Writing in Salon, Michael Lind takes this argument to an
extreme , suggesting that frequent fliers clubs are a way of privileging the rich and reflect
the deep inequalities of our society. â€œWhy donâ€™t we just make the new
class-based discrimination official? Instead of leaving it to airlines and other
corporations to construct the new apartheid piecemeal and informally, let the government
issue a Premium Elite Citizen Card, valid for multiple purposes.â€� Iâ€™m far
from convinced that treating your most frequent customers well by letting them board an
airplane first constitutes apartheid, but Iâ€™d agree that blurring a line between a
status offered by an airline for frequent passengers to a status that gives you a different
experience with a government agency, the TSA, is complicated and uncomfortable.

The conversation about Pre-âˆš is more than a little different in frequent fliers forums.
Fliers keep score of how often theyâ€™re waved into the Pre-âˆš line and how often
they have to suffer ordinary security experiences. And they get annoyed at the
unpredictability of the system, noting that if they knew theyâ€™d be granted
Pre-âˆš every time they flew, they could arrive at the airport later. One flyer calls the
program â€œ amazing and useless at the same time â€œ, because he canâ€™t count
on a quick screening experience.

This randomness is unlikely to disappear from the program, as itâ€™s a major security
feature. The TSA has published some of the criteria it uses to determine whoâ€™s
eligible for pre-screening: frequent travelers whoâ€™ve opted in, who donâ€™t
have weapons or explosive violations on their criminal records. This suggests that would-be
terrorists could start looking for frequent fliers with clean criminal records and recruit
them as suicide bombers. One of the protections against that vulnerability is to ensure that
Pre-âˆš flyers experience more intense scrutiny on some flights so that thereâ€™s
no guarantee that a cleared traveler is a surefire path through less intense screening.

Because the screening is, in part, random, itâ€™s going to raise questions about
fairness. How do we know the TSA isnâ€™t engaging in racial profiling , prohibiting
travelers with Arab heritage from participating in Pre-âˆš? Friends whoâ€™ve been
closely involved with Wikileaks report that they are now selected for secondary screening
virtually all times they travel , making clear that profiles, based at least in part on
behaviors or political views, can affect your TSA experience. Itâ€™s reasonable to
expect that, if Pre-âˆš continues, frequent travelers will complain that
theyâ€™re systematically being left out, punished for some part of their profile they
canâ€™t review or challenge.

Here, the TSA faces a challenge that surfaces in a wide range of settings: the difficulty of
publishing algorithms. A truly fair Pre-âˆš system would involve publishing the
algorithm the TSA uses to determine whoâ€™s safe to fly, and allowing travelers to
review whether they qualified and why. But publishing that algorithm increases the chances
that it will be gamed â€“ if we discover that flying 20 times in a year is a key factor for
clearance into the program, itâ€™s easy to imagine an adversary flying 20 times with
clean hand baggage and a bomb smuggled on the 21st flight.

Google faces a similar problem with their search algorithm. Countless merchants have
complained that Google ranks their sites too low in search results, sending business to their
competitors. The more paranoid (or, perhaps, more savvy?) suspect that Google is running an
extortion racket, offering high â€œorganicâ€� placement to those who purchase
ads, punishing those who donâ€™t. Google could address this fear by publishing their
algorithm and allowing sites to see how they ranked on different components of the algorithm.
They donâ€™t, because this would be hugely useful to the many people whoâ€™d
benefit from gaming the system. (The entire SEO industry is based around the premise that
search algorithms can be gamed with sufficient knowledge â€“ actually providing that
information would be of massive benefit to SEO firms and their clients, and likely to very
little user benefit.)

Itâ€™s possible to make an algorithm transparent and gaming resistant â€“
itâ€™s just very hard. You need to engineer algorithms where signals are expensive to
fake. The purest form of Google â€“ the â€œBackRubâ€� algorithm â€“ is
vulnerable to gaming because the signal (the number of pages linking to a page) is inexpensive
to fake â€“ create a â€œlinkfarmâ€� of pages pointing to your page, and
youâ€™re all set. Googleâ€™s algorithm may need to be obscure because in an online
environment, virtually all signals can be faked, given enough skill and effort.

TSA Pre-âˆš could well be another matter. If the main signal the program uses is lots and
lots of trips without incident, thatâ€™s a reasonably expensive signal. Our aspiring
terrorist might need to take hundreds of trips, spending tens of thousands of dollars, before
establishing a sufficiently clear reputation. Or she might have a great advantage, now
knowing precisely what type of frequent flier she needs to recruit to smuggle on the
all-important 125 ml of scary liquid. I certainly donâ€™t count on TSA making the
algorithms behind Pre-âˆš transparent, but it would be a small step towards addressing
questions of fairness the program is likely to face.

Weâ€™ve seen a strong push for open data in the US, a movement based on the idea that data
should be available to the general public in machine-readable, API-addressable form,
unless thereâ€™s very strong reasons to keep it secret. Iâ€™d like to see a similar
push around transparent algorithms, a principle that our government should be disclosing
algorithms that affect the lives of citizens, in as many circumstances as possible. I suspect
weâ€™d learn a great deal about making algorithms transparent and gaming-resistant if
it were significantly harder to rely on security via obscurity. Permalink

If You Were the Next Steve Jobs...



Umair Haque 3 Sep 2012, 2:00 pm CEST



...what problems would you try to solve?

Let me answer that by telling you a story.

Every writer will tell you: first, find a good cafÃ©. And while I was hunched over my laptop in
one my favorite tiny cafes in London â€” the estimable Kaffeine , purveyors of some of the
best coffee I've had the privilege to have â€” something tiny, yet remarkable,
happened.

After a few days, James, the barista, noticed that I'd come in, order a flat white , write like a
man possessed for an hour or so â€” but never finish my coffee. He asked me why, and I
replied that I espresso leaves me too wired to write, but paradoxically, I always need a
little. Without missing a beat, James simply proceeded to create an entirely new drink for me,
on the spot: a mini flat-white, which he half-jokingly named after me.

Now, this might sound entirely trivial. Until you ask yourself: how often, despite billions
spent on "service," "creativity," "innovation," "changing the game," "motivation,"
"leadership," and assorted other magical buzzword-incantations, has something like the
preceding happened to you, anywhere â€” ever? My bet is: outside of a truly excellent
bar, almost nowhere, probably never.

Imagine, for a moment, that you (yes, you) were the next Steve Jobs: what would your (real)
challenges be? I'd bet they wouldn't be scale (just call FoxConn), efficiency (call
FoxConn's consultants), short-term profitability (call FoxConn's consultants'
bankers), or even "growth" (call FoxConn's consultants' bankers' lobbyists). Those are the
problems of yesterday â€” and today, here's the thing: we largely know how to solve them.

Whether you're an assiduous manager, a chin-stroking economist, a superstar footballer, or
a rumpled artist, here's the unshakeable fact: you don't get to tomorrow by solving
yesterday's problems.

To solve today's set of burning problems, you just might have to build new institutions,
capable of handling stuff a little something like this...

Singularity. Scale is a solved problem. We know how to do stuff at very, very large scale
â€” if by stuff you mean "churning out the same widget, a billion times over". What we
don't know how to do is the opposite of scaling up: scaling down an institution, to make a
difference to a human life. Lives are singular ; and for institutions to truly matter in human
terms, they must go beyond the homogeneous, to the singular.

Consider: Starbucks will make your coffee to their specifications (extra-hot triple venti
soy latte with caramel!). That's just the same car, with a different color scheme. What James
made for me at Kaffeine was a coffee deftly, expertly created to make a tiny, slight, yet very
real difference to my life, on the spot. Now that's singularity.

Sociality. Through Kaffeine's singularity, I feel a little special. Like while I might not
have a full-blown relationship with them â€” and perhaps they with me â€” yet,
we're surely in something resembling the advanced dating stage of the courtship ritual .

Now consider: there's rarely a complaint I hear more often from the besuited John Galts of
capitalism's less-than-glorious present than the fist-banging "Wait. We have a Twitter
account â€” but we still don't really have relationships with people!" You don't say. I
mean, think about it for a moment: is it any surprise? Imagine you came home, and your
robo-clone-partner-bot dully read you the same canned script they were also reading about a
million other people at exactly the same time, in exactly the same words. Would you call that a
"relationship"? I'd call it, for anyone not a gawping rube, a "sham." Relationships happen
between human people â€” not between corporate "people" and human people, and
definitely not between brain-eating zombies and human people. So if it's relationships you
want, then you're going to have to ask people to connect with people â€” not just "greet,"
"check-out," "analyze," "reward," or "inspire."

Spontaneity. So what did it take for Kaffeine's barista to offer to make me â€” the
slightly awkward dude in combat boots hanging out in the corner for the last few weeks working
furiously on his next book â€” a coffee that wasn't just "mine", but designed to improve,
at a tiny level, my life? Consider: James wasn't getting a big bonus, a company
award-cum-paperweight, or stock options: the stock answers in trade of management gurus who
wish to "motivate" worker drones. So what was James getting? Perhaps something like the joy of
accomplishment or the fun of the challenge â€” prizes that money, in point of fact, can't
buy. And he could pursue those higher-order rewards â€” and in the pursuit of those
rewards, create something singularly worthwhile for me â€” because, simply, vitally,
he was free to do so. At most McStitutions, the idea that a "valued team member" would be free to
act sans script, formula, or routine, is about as likely as the idea that you're really a giant
pink inflatable Godzilla named "Marmaduke." Look, think about it this way: every internet
dating profile in the world begs for some spontaneity â€” not just because it's
exciting, but because formula never led anywhere but to the same old stale, yawn-inducing
answer: the one you probably broke up with last month. Spontaneity is the act of human
potential unfurling in the moment â€” and if it's human potential you wish to ignite,
then it's spontaneity you need to spark.

Synchronicity. One common misinterpretation of management theory goes thus: pit your best
people against one another, like dogs in a fight, and the wondrous power of "competition" will
unleash vital energies heretofore unseen in the history of great endeavor. Taking a hard look
at the organizations that practice this style of management-by-Mordor, my guess is that the
unbridled exaltation of aggression is more like the express train to Sociopath City. Just
look at investment banks.

In point of fact, what distinguishes organizations that achieve enduring greatness is
teamwork and collaboration â€” and those are words so overused, they make my teeth ache
just saying them. Here's my bet: it's time to drop the fourth wall of the "team" â€” and go
beyond collaboration, to something like what Jung called synchronicity: a kind of uncanny
intersection of seemingly unrelated lives. At Kaffeine, I became something more than a
customer, and something more like a team member: the barista wasn't working "for" me, to dully
serve up another tedious, formulaic, McCoffee: he was, working with me, to craft a coffee that
benefitted me not just in the sense that I needed a shot of caffeine, but in real human terms; a
mini-coffee that fit the fact that I needed a tiny jolt to finish my book â€” and in that
moment, we were were synced up; on the "same team", so to speak; not just slack-jawed
"consumer" at odds with distant, aloof (or perhaps unscrupulous,
read-the-fine-print-of-the-fine-print) "producer."

Solubility. But the biggest lesson â€” and the one hidden in plain sight â€” is
this: creating institutions capable of not just solving the same old problems, forever. All
too often, I hear the furious debate of problems already long-ago solved. Consider the
curious case of profitability. Little is more intensely, heatedly discussed in boardrooms
â€” but the truth is that profits have never been higher, both in real terms or as a share of
GDP. Profit is a solved problem: we know, to a pretty good approximation, how to make companies
profitable (at least in the short run, for the benefit of shareholders, often to the detriment
of, well, everyone and everything else). Now, I don't mean that you, the struggling
entrepreneur, face no challenges â€” but I do mean that having read a few books, spoken to
a few mentors, and crunched a few numbers, probably have a shot at applying a set of well-worn
lessons that, should the fates smile on you, lead you to the promised land of profitability.

This is also true at the very micro and the very macro level. For instance, we know how to run a
meeting , but as any office worker will tell you, instances of effectively run meetings are
vanishingly scarce. To take a very macro, economy-wide example, look at productivity.
Though it's often still hotly debated hither and thither, the truth is that (simple)
productivity, like profitability, is something like a solved problem. Work fewer people
harder, with faster, smarter robots â€” and hey, presto: productivity. And that seems
to be, sometimes, our entirely inadequate recipe for national prosperity â€” one
destined to doom the middle class to even more striking levels of hardship and penury.

James, remarkably, was solving an unsolved problem. No one had ever made me the perfect coffee
before â€” otherwise, I probably would've simply asked for it. Nor was he simply
assuming that by brewing up a triple-venti-etc, he'd "solved" the problem of a coffee made not
just for me â€” but for me .

So I'd suggest perhaps the greatest challenge for tomorrow's would-be problem-solver
renegades is this: building institutions that don't keep solving the same old solved
problems, like profitability, scale, efficiency, productivity, and the like. Over and over
again, like algorithms of human organization run amok. Institutions that are capable of
taking a hard look at unsolved problems around the globe â€” as big as climate change,
sending humans to Mars, and redesigning the global financial system, and as small as Umair's
perfect coffee â€” and then accepting the difficult, often painful, always
fulfilling, work of attempting to solve them. Call this property, if you like, "solubility."
You know how our political parties are "debating"...pretty much exactly what they were in
1980? That's insolubility: institutions stuck, like glue, on the same old (readily
solvable) problems â€” instead of looking unflinchingly into the unresolved, hazy
future, and resolutely pioneering it.

Sure â€” it might seem laughably preposterous to read the future of prosperity into the
creamy foam topping an Umair (hey, that's what my coffee's called, remember?). Yet, if the
question is "Where do tomorrow's institutions come from?" my answer is: from today's
pioneers. Go ahead and burn me at the stake, but I'd advance the heretical idea that yes, even a
humble barista just might be light-years ahead of our so-called visionary leaders when it
comes to the art of reimagining the epic facepalm of a fail that you and I currently call the
status quo. You don't get to tomorrow by solving yesterday's problems, over and over and ov
â€” remember Einstein's definition of insanity? "Doing the same thing over and over
again and expecting different results."

So let me put it this way. Steve â€” that Steve â€” once famously dared the
buttoned-down John Sculley, then CEO of PepsiCo, thus: "Do you want to sell sugar-water for
the rest of your life â€” or do you want to come with me and change the world?" Let me, to draw
out the lesson of James's parable, revise Steve's question, dare you thus: "Do you want to
spend the rest of your life making the metaphorical equivalent of
triple-venti-soy-latte-chinos, forever â€” or do you want to build an institution fit
for a future worth fighting for?"

NB. Let's not turn this into a for-and against Apple discussion. Sure, one can take difference
with Apple's labour issues and platform strategy. If you'd like to, then your answer to my
question might be: "If I was the next Steve Jobs, I'd introduce living wages and open up
everything everywhere â€” because tomorrow's institutions ..."

Understanding digital civics



...My heart's in Accra 30 Aug 2012, 7:33 pm CEST



Earlier this week, I gave a lecture titled â€œThe Emergence of Digital Civicsâ€� at
Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. I was in South Austalia to give another lecture,
a joint lecture with Dr. Genevieve Bell of Intel in memory of her friend James Tizard . I hope to
write up the talks Genevieve and I gave, but since I had detailed notes for my civics lecture,
Iâ€™ve worked them into a blog post.





In Kansas City, a young man named Jase Wilson is trying to build a trolley system. Kansas City
applied to the US department of transportation for a grant to help build the trolley line and
was rejected. So Jase built a website called Neighbor.ly, and asked his friends and neighbors
to help him raise $10 million towards the project .

I donâ€™t know if Jase is going to succeed â€“ given that heâ€™s only raised a
few thousand dollars so far, it seems pretty unlikely. But Iâ€™m paying attention to
Jaseâ€™s experiment, because I think heâ€™s one of the pioneers experimenting
with what Iâ€™m calling internet-native civics. Whether Jase succeeds or fails, his
experiment raises the question: How do people whoâ€™ve grown up using the internet
engage in civic life? I see great potential and great possible harm from some of these
experiments. I worry weâ€™re heading uncritically towards a different way of
conceiving of the civic relationships between individuals and governments. But I also think
that if we can figure out how to harness these internet-based forms of civic engagement, we
might revitalize political participation.

Thereâ€™s a worthwhile critique of discussions about the internet and civic
engagement that asks why weâ€™d impute any special powers to a communication medium. I
agree that we are oversimplifying situations when we declare that Facebook overthrew
Mubarak or that Chinese authoritarianism cannot survive the rise of Weibo microblogging
services. But it would also be a mistake not to take seriously the role of new communications
media in understanding civic life. In democratic states, citizens need information about
what challenges a government faces and what itâ€™s proposing to do about it to be
effective citizens. And citizens need to be able to connect with one another to discuss,
debate and propose solutions. What a communications medium makes possible has a shaping
influence on civic life.

In the United States, the government made an investment early on in a technology designed to
connect citizens so they could govern themselves. This wasnâ€™t the internet, but the
postal system, established in the US Constitution, and implemented in a way that encouraged
citizens to use the mails, the connective technology of the time, as a civic space. The postal
system subsidized the distribution of newspapers, allowing newspaper publishers to trade
â€œexchange copiesâ€� with other publishers at no cost, a phenomenon which meant
content was often reprinted, with a paper in one state offering perspectives from a distant
city. It cost so much less to send a newspaper than a private letter that frugal correspondents
sometimes composed letters by placing pinpricks under words in newspaper articles. With
costs of newspapers so low, many Americans subscribed to several papers, reading news and
opinion from multiple political and geographic perspectives. (Iâ€™m leaning heavily
on Paul Starrâ€™s â€œThe Creation of the Mediaâ€� here, both for the
historical events and the core insight on media structure and democratic process.)

As the structure of the media industry changed, we see some parallel changes in politics. The
rise of advertising as a major source of newspaper revenue, replacing subscription,
encouraged newspapers to move from partisan, opinionated organs to
â€œobjectiveâ€� papers that sought to report events in a way to attract readers of
all political persuasions. Papers increased in size and began covering more national and
international events, relying on reports via telegraph to provide information, and
published less opinion content. This shift from a multifaceted party press, with a great deal
of local color and opinion, to a more nationally focused press coincides with the rise of a
strong two party system and the lessening of local influence over political platforms. As
broadcast media, and especially television, become dominant media forms, politics becomes
synchronized nationally. Itâ€™s no longer possible to speak one way in one region, and
differently in another â€“ pander to segregationists in the South and youâ€™ll be
seen by an audience in the North as well. My friend danah boyd refers to â€œunseen
audiencesâ€� in her work on social media â€“ young people writing to their friends
on Facebook arenâ€™t always cognizant of future employers, who might read their posts.
Politicians quickly became aware of these unseen audiences and changed their rhetoric to
appeal to these wider audiences.

This change has helped stamp out some of the peculiarities and quirks of US politics. Even
within a two-party system, we had political parties that had regional variations:
Dixiecrats were reliably democratic, but far from progressive on issues of racial justice,
while the Northeast featured a now extinct species of politician, the socially moderate,
fiscally conservative Republican. (I miss them. Such lovely plumage.) Broadcast media has
helped act as a synchronizing function, allowing party leaders to demand their candidates
stay in line with party values, whatever local sensibilities might otherwise dictate. Being
declared outside the mainstream of a party is the kiss of death. Once Lincoln Chafee, a
decidedly quirky Rhode Island liberal Republican, was declared a RINO â€“
â€œRepublican In Name Onlyâ€� â€“ his political career was over, even though
his stances might have been acceptable to local voters. The end result is two deeply polarized
parties, each with a deep geographic base and a largely unshakeable platform, with very
little incentive to talk with the other.

Another effect of the rise of broadcast media is a rise in fiscal costs of politics. Television
is very expensive, which turns political campaigns into fundraising contests. For years,
itâ€™s been routine to report on political campaigns by comparing how much money each
candidate has raised. Now the game has taken on a new dimension with the Citizens United
ruling, which gives corporations the same rights as individuals to spend in elections, and
has created a new category of SuperPACs, designed to work on behalf of a candidate, but not
â€œin coordinationâ€� with that candidate. Thus far, the 2012 campaign is shaping
up to be one of the nastier campaigns in recent memory, focused less on the issues and more on the
personal shortcomings of each candidate. (And, while I support President Obama, I fear his
campaign may actually be nastier than the Romney campaign thus far.)

Legal scholar Larry Lessig suggests weâ€™re in an age of corporate capture of American
politics, a form of corruption so deep that thereâ€™s no alternative but to strike at the
root: public financing for campaigns, end of corporate personhood. He may be right. But
thereâ€™s another school of thought that sees an evolution of politics in parallel with
a shift in dominant media. As we move towards participatory, internet-based media, perhaps
weâ€™re moving towards a newly participatory, internet-based democracy.

This idea surfaced in a big way during the Howard Dean campaign in 2004. Dean was a democratic
candidate for president in 2004, and while he fell far short of the nomination, he captured the
imagination of a large group of tech-savvy activists, who saw an opportunity to build a
political platform and policy proposals online. That participatory energy was harnessed
well by Barack Obama in 2008, who asked suporters to focus their efforts not on developing
policy proposals, but on promoting his candidacy. Obama built a massive email list, which
allowed him to raise huge sums of money through small contributions. But once he got elected,
it was less clear that his presidency would feature online participation. An early
experiment to set priorities for the administration for the first 100 days of the presidency
invited supporters to propose high priority issues. When online voters pushed marijuana
legalization to the top of the stack, Obama made it clear that he wasnâ€™t going to be
unduly influenced by this online input. Itâ€™s certainly possible that other forms of
online deliberation will have an influence in American politics, but itâ€™s far from
obvious that collaborative authoring of legislation (as with the effort to write
alternatives to SOPA/PIPA) will be embraced by those in power. And these systems tend to fall
victim to capture by those who are the most articulate or the most persistent, who are able to
out-talk others through skill or relentlessness.

If collective deliberation hasnâ€™t sharply transformed politics, perhaps access to
government data will. The Obama administration committed to policies of opening government
data, with mixed reviews . In the meantime, the Sunlight Foundation and others have been
collecting and presenting data designed to keep government accountable and expose possible
corruption. There have been some impressive victories in the space, like the exposure of
family members working for pay on political campaigns, allowing a politicianâ€™s
family to benefit financially from political donations. While these data sets and tools are
deeply useful for political junkies and to journalists, they donâ€™t seem to be
reaching the general public.

MySociety , a UK-based open government firm headed by Tom Steinberg, approaches the problem
of engaging the public with government data from a different perspective. While Steinberg
and his colleagues are deeply interested in and engaged with public data, they donâ€™t
assume that their users are. Instead, they offer tools like FixMyStreet , which allows
individuals to take a photograph of things that need fixing in their neighborhood and upload
the images and coordinates to the site. This allows FixMyStreet to provide local governments
with a map of complaints, but the real aim of the system is more subtle: itâ€™s designed to
teach users how to be powerful and effective citizens. When your complaint of a pothole
doesnâ€™t lead to rapid repair, FixMyStreet contacts you, reminds you that the issue is
still outstanding and suggests what you might do to get a response, escalating the complaint
up the local government hierarchy. FixMyTransport goes a step further and suggests that
youâ€™re unlikely to fix many transit problems unless you and others in your
neighborhood form groups to lobby for systemic changeâ€Š and then introduces you to
others in your neighborhood interested in these issues. What looked like a simple,
user-friendly tool to enable you to report a problem becomes an introductory course in
civics, with a focus on who need to nag, pressure and embarrass to achieve change.

One of the pioneers in civics education in the US is Senator Bob Graham . Graham spent a life in
public service, as a state legislator, governor and finally as one of the stateâ€™s two
senators, and with 38 years of public service, he knows a thing or two about how government
works. Graham has dedicated his retirement to helping students understand civics and become
engaged citizens. His book, â€œAmerica, the Ownerâ€™s Manualâ€� is a
thoughtful course in civics designed for the contemporary college student. Each of ten
chapters starts with a story in which young people are able to accomplish change through a
different set of tactics, then outlines the steps youâ€™d need to take to understand the
government well enough to know who to influence, how to marshall facts and test the waters of
public opinion, and to influence policymakers.

I read the book on the flight from Boston to northern Florida to meet with the director of the Bob
Graham Center at the University of Florida , and realized that was caught between two
reactions. On the one hand, I thought Grahamâ€™s book was one of the best introductions
to civics Iâ€™d read, and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible. My other
impulse was to declare the book completely unrealistic, impractical and out of touch with a
moment in time where American politics seems to be irretrievably broken.

Several of Grahamâ€™s examples involve influencing Congress, a body that now faces a
13% approval rating. As recently as two decades ago, congressional approval was near 70%.
Whatâ€™s changed? Partisan divides are so sharp that cooperation seems impossible,
and abuse of the senateâ€™s filibuster and hold rules has slowed the legislative
process to a crawl. The situation is so bad that the government came within days of defaulting
on treasury debt payments due to congressional intransigence. And this is the body Graham
would like young people to influence to seek change?

The rise of four popular movements suggests that activists to the left and the right
arenâ€™t looking to Congress for change. Consider these four groups â€“ the Tea
Party, the Occupy Movement, Anonymous and Wikileaks. The Tea Party begins from the
assumption that government is bound to screw things up, and that eliminating government or
blocking its effectiveness is the best citizens can hope for. Heavily influenced by anti-tax
crusader Grover Norquist, many Tea Party activists cheered the near-default on treasury
bills. Default would make it harder for the government to borrow, which would force
government to contract through a strategy called â€œstarve the beastâ€�. If we
donâ€™t permit taxes to rise and insist on eliminating deficits, government will have
to shrink.

Occupy has more global currency despite US origins, because the targets of the movement are
inherently global: theyâ€™re multinational corporations and larger systems of
capitalism. Inspired by frustration with bank bailouts and the perception that political
influence is no longer in the hands of citizens, some of the most interesting work of the
movement has been creating communities that are functioning independent of the existing
state. They accept Lessigâ€™s critique of corporate capture of the political process,
but while theyâ€™re criticizing corporate personhood and corruption,
theyâ€™re also trying to build alternative models on small scales, in individual
encampments.

Wikileaks, to the extent that itâ€™s an ideology and movement, rather than the
struggles of Julian Assange against extradition, has focused on the idea that governments
rely on secrecy to operate. Removing this secrecy will spark an immune reaction that will not
just right the specific wrongs uncovered, but will change the entire system, either by
prompting rebellion and demands for fairer government, or through a complex immune-system
reaction where the system becomes so paranoid, it destroys itself. (Here Iâ€™m relying
on Aaron Badyâ€™s reading of an early Assange essay to posit an agenda to explain
individual Wikileaks campaigns.)

Itâ€™s hard to know if Anonymous has a fixed mission, or just a method: using the internet
to attack, embarrass and call attention to wrongs in the world. Given Anonâ€™s tendency
to do things â€œfor the lulzâ€� and to condemn the â€œmoralfagsâ€� for
being too concerned with politics, itâ€™s always dangerous to pin a single philosophy
on the movement. But many participants see themselves as engaged in a civic movement
thatâ€™s making meaningful progress on the important issues of the day, including
copyright and repression of free speech.

What these four movements have in common is that theyâ€™re not about civics as usual. In
conventional civics, we define a problem, figure out whoâ€™s got the ability to change
it, marsall support for our movement and persuade the decisionmakers to make a change.
Thatâ€™s not what these groups are looking for. The Tea Party wants those systems to
shrink to the point of disfunctionality, removing problems from the realm of government and
leaving them for individuals, NGOs and corporations to solve. Occupy seems deeply divided on
whether it makes sense to try to influence existing systems of power, or to build new forms of
power. Wikileaks and Anonymous see power as being located within media, not existing
political systems, so theyâ€™re unlikely to pick loci of influence that are similar to
those used by Bob Graham or Tom Steinberg.

When I work with activists around the world, I ask them to think through some of the same
questions Graham asks: what is it you want, and who would you need to influence to achieve that
change? Once youâ€™ve got a theory of change, tactics tend to fall into place. In my
discussions, Iâ€™m seeing four primary theories of change at work.

The one Senator Graham is most focused on is a legislative theory of change. Assume that
weâ€™re working to achieve full rights for gays and lesbians. In an open society,
weâ€™d pass legislation prohibiting discrimination based on sexuality, enabling gay
marriage, etc. It might be a hard push, but once the law was on the books, we wouldnâ€™t
have to fight individual battles. In the US, most human rights organizations tend to work on
this level, which means their preferred tactics involve court cases to challenge bad
legislation and influencing legislators to pass good legislation.

Passing a law so that your pothole gets filled isnâ€™t the right solution to the problems
Tom Steinberg is interested in. There, you need to find someone in a position of power and urge
them to work on your behalf. This can work within complex governmental systems and in
non-governmental systems â€“ if you want a company to provide domestic partnership
benefits for gay workers, even if youâ€™ve not passed the legislation at a national
level, you might have success persuading the CEO. And in closed societies, influencing
authority figures may be the only theory of change that consistently works, as legislation
may be selectively enforced. We can influence authority figures through lobbying, through
petitions and through pressure campaigns, including boycotts and buycotts, as well as
through mobilizing media attention.

What if you donâ€™t just want gay and lesbian people to have the right to work and to marry?
What if you actually want people to like and accept them? Youâ€™re likely to work for
cultural change, seeking positive portrayals of gays and lesbians in the news and in
entertainment media. Itâ€™s helpful to have legislation passed and to get authority
figures to say the right things, but cultural change tends to be a media-driven theory of
change, designed to slowly win over the hearts and minds of millions.

Iâ€™m seeing lots of activism these days that recognizes that it may take a long time to
change laws, the attitudes of people in authority or the culture as a whole. In the meantime,
can we provide services to people in harmâ€™s way? If gay youth are at risk of bullying,
depression and suicide, we might provide hotlines and build support groups. Itâ€™s
hard to scale this work, but itâ€™s a deeply satisfying and practical way of working,
fixing addressable problems in a community. Whether or not our work sets an example for other
communities, it was worth doing.

(Two interesting places Iâ€™m seeing the service theory of change at work: Occupy, and
in Russia. Occupy encampments found themselves working closely with local homeless
populations, and often providing food, shelter and some counseling services. In Russia,
poor government response to forest fires in the summer of 2010 led to a volunteer movement to
fill cars with food, clothes and blankets and deliver what was needed to affected
communities. In both cases, the efforts are critiques of government failure, while
provisioning services that were needed.)

If Senator Graham and Tom Steinberg are teaching civics, helping us learn to influence
legislators and government authority figures, I think weâ€™re starting to see lessons
in cultural and service theories of change coming from the internet. Further, Iâ€™d
argue that the internet is especially well suited for enabling change using these two
theories, and that weâ€™re likely to see civics that reflect the rise of citizen power
through influencing culture and providing services directly.

The old civics taught us how to identify authority figures to influence and understand
processes to lobby for change. A new digital civics teaches us how to raise attention for
causes, how to use distributed populations to propose solutions to problems, and how to
synchronize supporters around a strategy.

Letâ€™s consider Kony2012 , a campaign intended to mobilize youth in the US that grew so
large it received significant attention on the Australian side of the Pacific. Invisible
Children, the organizers of the movement, are deeply passionate about arresting Joseph
Kony, Ugandan warlord and head of a group called the Lordâ€™s Resistance Army. The
organization faced a challenging problem, in that the LRA is not near the top of
anyoneâ€™s threats list globally, or even in eastern Africa, probably with good
reason. While Kony had a horrific impact on northern Uganda about a decade ago, he now has a few
hundred fighters at most, and is hiding deep in the jungle, far from centers of population.

Invisible Children needed to get Kony onto the political agenda, which they accomplished by
putting Kony on the media agenda. The goal of the Kony2012 campaign â€“ to make Kony
famous â€“ is a classic cultural theory of change using social media as the primary
tactic for spreading attention. With a deeply manipulative viral video and a very smart
campaign that used students already committed to the movement to build social media buzz,
lobbying celebrities to throw their attention to the movement, Invisible Children
generated 100 million views of their video in six days and caught the attention of political
leaders who may have been unaware of the issues previously. Was the campaign a success? If the
goal was to get millions of Americans focused on the LRA on an ongoing basis, the answer is no
â€“ Invisible Childrenâ€™s call to action, a night where students would take to
the streets and spread information about Kony, received far less attention than the initial
video. But itâ€™s likely that the campaign succeeded as a more traditional legislative
campaign, as Congress has reaffirmed support for an ongoing US troop presence in Uganda to
pursue Kony.

By contrast, the Occupy movement gained a large amount of attention, but has had little
success channeling it to specific legislative changes. The helpful website
WhatTheFuckHasOccupyDone lists some of the movementâ€™s accomplishments â€“
while one (commentary on a bank regulation bill) engages specifically with legislative
processes, and several point to concrete achievements in providing services, many of the
accomplishments focus on cultural change. Occupy, the site asserts, has made inequality
central to policy debates and called attention to ongoing issues of corporate influence over
political systems. This may be true, though itâ€™s hard to know how lasting these
changes will be. But given Occupyâ€™s reasonable skepticism of the legislative
process, it may not be reasonable to ask movement leaders to push for change through a system
they have little confidence in. The danger is that attention is a fragile commodity and tends
to decay quickly, if not harnessed to action.

As with KONY2012, activism around SOPA/PIPA began by calling attention to an issue that
handâ€™t been in the public spotlight, a bill backed by the copyright industry with
far-reaching implications for internet governance. A broad range of activists worked to
call attention to the bill, reframe it as a bill about censorship, not anti-piracy, and to
propose dozens of different strategies to protest the legislation. One particular tactic
â€“ blacking out a website in protest â€“ was promoted by online community Reddit,
and when Wikipedia declared that the English-language version of the site would black out,
hundreds of other sites decided to join the protest. This process of gaining attention,
brainstorming multiple tactics and converging on a specific, scaleable tactic looks like
one possible outline for successful digital activism, though itâ€™s not clear it will
work for other, less internet connected issues. But for the moment, SOPA/PIPA appears dead,
and the internet has gained a cadre of activists willing to follow a â€œcat
signalâ€� to mobilize in defense of threats to the internet.

Raising attention is useful for attracting money and for passing legislation, but
thereâ€™s a danger that attention can quickly dissipate if underlying political
systems are too badly broken to make real change possible. In those cases, using attention to
support direction action looks like a good alternative. This returns us to Jase Wilson in
Kansas City. If the government wonâ€™t create a trolley line, Wilson wonders whether he
might be able to build one himself by gaining attention and raising money from possible
supporters.

If Wilsonâ€™s effort succeeded, there would be some tough questions to answer . Would
the Kansas City government be required to maintain the trolley he and supporters built? What
if they canâ€™t afford to do so or decide they donâ€™t want to do so? What message
does it send that donors are able to provide services that a government canâ€™t provide?
Does this attempt to build public goods through crowdfunding inadvertently support the
notion that governments should do less and people should do more, replacing taxes with
voluntary donations?

Thereâ€™s lots of reasons to love civic crowdfunding. It allows for distributed
innovation, where individuals can propose interventions, raise attention to the most
compelling ideas and synchronize giving to make pilot projects possible. It takes advantage
of an internet-age fondness for choice. Weâ€™re interested in sponsoring exactly the
projects weâ€™re interested in, and having a relationship with the people
weâ€™re benefitting, whether weâ€™re lending money on Kiva, donating it on
GlobalGiving or DonorsChoose, or investing in an arts project on Kickstarter. But
thereâ€™s a reason to fear it, too, especially if crowdfunding turns into an
alternative to taxation and support for a minimalist state.

Efforts like Jase Wilsonâ€™s campaign quickly lead us into thorny philosophical
territory. Do we celebrate or condemn these new forms of civic innovation? I think we might
start addressing those questions by answering a simpler one â€“ what are the strengths
and weaknesses of these new forms of digital civics?

Thereâ€™s good evidence that the internet helps us: - Change the media agenda by
channeling attention towards an issue or cause - Brainstorming a wide range of possible
tactics and theories of change - Synchronizing people around one or more campaigns,
contributing attention, money and other forms of engagement

Thus far, thereâ€™s less evidence that the internet helps with - Creating spaces for
reasoned deliberation, particularly across ideological lines - Channeling attention to
move levers of power - Sustaining projects beyond their inception - Choosing between
competing demands for our attention â€“ i.e., is capturing Kony more worthy of our
attention that fighting for freedom of speech in Ethiopia, or was it simply better marketed. -
Ensuring that resources are allocated fairly

Iâ€™m beginning to think that certain types of civic participation are simply organic
to the internet. Once we have the ability to create and share our own information, we create and
spread media to promote the causes we care about and raise money to support the causes we value.
If these trends are general ones, they might suggest what we might hope governments could do in
response.

I believe we want governments to help us ensure that digital civics leads to a world
thatâ€™s more fair. Itâ€™s the nature of civic engagement that the articulate and
the angry get the most attention. This tendency may be amplified in digital civics, given that
much of the practice involves manipulating and channeling attention. If digitally savvy
activists gain support for their causes at the expense of the less wired, and communities with
disposable income finance new public goods, while poorer communities go without, we should
expect governments to help level the playing field. This might mean learning from civic
innovations in more privileged communities and providing funding and support for similar
interventions in less-resourced areas.

If internet civics are good at starting experiments and bad at sustaining projects, can we use
civic crowdfunding to start experiments and taxes to sustain projects in the long term? If
weâ€™re bad at online deliberation, can some of the tricks of contemporary offline
civics, like participatory budgeting, come into play in online spaces? In other words, if
weâ€™re moving to a world where online power complements offline power, how do we build
and teach a new form of civics that takes advantage of what seems to work best offline and
online? Permalink

â€œLong Flightsâ€� â€“ a somewhat serious business idea



...My heart's in Accra 30 Aug 2012, 5:06 pm CEST



Iâ€™m considering starting a new business venture. Itâ€™s called â€œLong
Flightâ€� and itâ€™s based on my experiences writing on airplanes.

Iâ€™ve hit a point in my career where I organize my schedule to maximize the number of long
flights I get to take. Sometimes this means accepting an invitation I might have otherwise
ducked â€“ i.e., coming to Australia for only five days on the ground, as I just did. Other
times, it means scheduling flights that look insane on paper â€“ Boston to Hong Kong the
long way around, via Amsterdam â€“ so I can get more writing time in. (Did that late last
year, and finished my favorite chapter of this book in the process.)

Obviously, scheduling a long flight as a form of writing retreat is stupid in all sorts of ways.
Unless someone else is paying you to travel, itâ€™s crazy expensive. And even if
someoneâ€™s paying you to fly to Adelaide for a few days, itâ€™s got massive
environmental impacts. So Iâ€™m thinking about a business that lets you stay on the
ground, but rent a writing space that mimics the key features of a long plane flight.

No connectivity â€“ Iâ€™ve been productive on long flights where Iâ€™ve had
internet access, but itâ€™s a very different form of productivity. Craig Newmark and I
were invited to the same conference in South Korea some years back and sat side by side for 15
hours, answering email on the way from NYC to Seoul. I reached inbox zero, but I didnâ€™t
write anything I was proud of, as I kept getting distracted by incoming mail. And that was
before Twitter.

â€œLong Flightâ€� facilities will be located inside Faraday cages. Once you enter
the facility, your phone will be cut off from GSM and CDMA networks, and Wifi wonâ€™t
work. Youâ€™ll be encouraged to download and cache anything youâ€™ll need to read
ahead of time.

Fixed duration â€“ I work well in libraries, but I tend to leave them after Iâ€™ve
accomplished the main task Iâ€™d had on my to do list. One of the reason long flights are so
productive is that youâ€™re committed to staying in a space well beyond the time you need
to accomplish a task. For me, that means I get a blogpost or chapter written, but I also catch up
on papers Iâ€™ve needed to read.

â€œLong Flightâ€� facilities will be bookable for durations of 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14
hours. Weâ€™ll refer to the duration by the names of cities â€“ book an 8 hour
session at our Boston facility and weâ€™ll reference your stint as an
â€œIstanbulâ€�. Youâ€™ll be free to walk around the facility, pass other
peopleâ€™s compartments, access the rest rooms and snack counter, but your access key
wonâ€™t let you leave the building until your session is up. (Youâ€™ll sign a
waiver that prevents us from being charged with holding you against your will. And
weâ€™ll have an emergency protocol, so you can press a button and call emergency
services. But if you abuse it to end your session early, weâ€™ll ban you from the
facility.)

Each pod will feature a screen that shows the progress of your flight to your
â€œdestinationâ€�. Since youâ€™ll be ending up back in Boston, perhaps
weâ€™ll start in Istanbul and follow a great circle route back. The screen will
helpfully inform you that itâ€™s -52C outside, which should serve as an incentive to
remain in the facility.

Visibility â€“ I often work in coffee shops because I find that I focus better when other
people can look over my shoulder. Iâ€™m less likely to watch a movie Iâ€™ve ripped
to my laptop or flip through my photo collection if everyone around me can see that Iâ€™m
procrastinating.

â€œLong Flightâ€� will assign you a pod within a shared space. Youâ€™ll be
able to see what your neighbors are doing, and they can see you. Conversation will be
discouraged by a loud white noise machine that permeates the space, encouraging you to put on
headphones and listen to whatever music youâ€™ve brought with you.

Food and beverage â€“ When Iâ€™m working in libraries, what ultimately breaks my
concentration is the need to go out for lunch or dinner. While the snacks and meals provided on
board planes arenâ€™t always the tastiest, the ability to eat where youâ€™re
working is helpful, and being able to walk to the galley for another beverage can be a useful
break in routine.

Your admission to â€œLong Flightâ€� will include unlimited food and beverage from
the galleys. The food and beverage wonâ€™t be very exciting â€“ cheese
sandwiches, salty snacks, and a soda fountain. Iâ€™m undecided on whether there might
be a booze option â€“ for an extra fee â€“ for those who want to work sober, then have a
drink or two and work more loosely.

Let me know if you have any other feature requests, or ideas for where we might locate these
facilities. Iâ€™m thinking about locations that are accessible via public transport,
but in lower rent neighborhoods, as no one will be leaving the facility anyway, and the windows
will simply show a blue sky with clouds below you.

Franchise opportunities are available, cheap. :-) Permalink

Now representing @Swedenâ€Š



...My heart's in Accra 23 Aug 2012, 12:40 am CEST



Last year, Sweden took on an experiment in social media as a form of nation branding by turning
over its national Twitter account, @sweden , to a different citizen each week. Citizens are
nominated and evaluated by a panel, but their tweets arenâ€™t reviewed or edited, which
led some observers to predict the experiment would be a social media disaster .

Those predictions came true, more or less, with the week Sonja Abrahamsson took over the
account. She spent the week offending as many people as possible, with offhand observations
about Jews, people with AIDS, and the suggestion that her life would be easier if she had
Downâ€™s syndrome. In other words, she used @sweden to troll anyone who was paying
attention . (Trolls, of course, hail from Scandinavian folklore and may be native to Sweden,
so perhaps this behavior is simply part of the national character.)

It was a happy surprise to see this weekâ€™s curator, an Iraqi-Swede named Naseer
Alkhouri who normally tweets as @naseeral , using the account to discuss complex ideas about
nationality and identity.

Let us talk a bit about something we in Sweden call â€œinbetweenhoodâ€�. I came to
Sweden from Iraq as a refugee at the age of 10.

@kinkymal maloki



At the first Global Voices summit, eight years ago, Hossein Derakhshan offered a model for
understanding the role social media could play in helping people understand life in another
part of the world. Blogs could act as windows, bridges and as cafÃ©s, offering us a glimpse
into life in another corner of the world, a connection to some place different than where we
already are, and, maybe, a space to gather and have a conversation.

Swedenâ€™s experiment proposes to use Twitter as a window. Inviting
â€œordinaryâ€� Swedes to tweet about everyday life promises a picture of life in
Sweden thatâ€™s likely to be different from impressions we get of the nation through
news, through entertainment media or through our interaction with Swedes in our social
networks. Ideally, it gives the sort of multifaceted picture we might have of the nation if we
had lots of Swedish friends in our social network, including â€œinbetweenersâ€�
like Naseer and trolls like Sonja.

But the Swedish experiment is an attempt at building bridges as well. For one thing, the
experiment asks participants to tweet in English rather than Swedish so the conversation is
accessible to a wider audience. Nasserâ€™s decision to start his stint representing
@sweden by telling his story is a form of bridging as well â€“ by understanding his
personal story, weâ€™ve got a better chance of paying attention to the trivia of his
everyday existence. And itâ€™s possible that the comments on some of his posts will open
a cafÃ© of sorts, a conversation about what it means to be Swedish, bicultural, racist or
nationalist.

Iâ€™m interested to see that my neighbors to the north, in Vermont, are trying a similar
model , hoping that showing tweets from Vermont will help portray the state as younger and more
tech savvy than we might otherwise assume. Iâ€™ll be interested to see whether more
Swedes or Vermonters use Twitter to tell their personal story and build a relationship while
theyâ€™re opening a window into their lives. Permalink

What would it take to start a gun control debate in the US?



...My heart's in Accra 14 Aug 2012, 8:58 pm CEST



2012 has been a bad year for gun violence in the United States. Yesterday, Thomas Caffall,
apparently distraught about being evicted from him home in College Station, Texas, shot and
killed a Brazos County constable and a bystander . Earlier this month, white supremacist Wade
Michael Page entered a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and killed or wounded 10
worshippers. And less than a month ago, James Holmes opened fire during a screening of
â€œThe Dark Knight Risesâ€�, killing or wounding 70 in Aurora, Colorado. Earlier
this year, Ian Stawicki shot 7 people in a cafÃ© in Seattle, Washington, and One L. Goh killed
or injured 10 when he attacked students at Oikos University in Oakland, California.

Mark Follman, Gavin Aronsen, and Deanna Pan have compiled a map and timeline of mass shootings
for Mother Jones, counting incidents where at least 4 people are killed. (By their criteria,
yesterdayâ€™s shooting in Texas, while tragic, is not a mass killing.) Reviewing their
data, 2012 is the worst year for mass shootings in recent memory, with 4 incidents responsible
for 97 deaths and injuries. 2009 also had 4 mass shootings with 77 dead and injured, and the 12
month period from April 2007 (the Virginia Tech shooting) through March 2008 included 111
killed or injured in five incidents. In other words, 2012 is horrific, but not unprecedented.

The Mother Jones story points out that there have been 60 mass murders in the US since 1982. The
vast majority â€“ more than three quarters â€“ of weapons used in the shootings
were obtained legally by the killers. This last point is an important one. Itâ€™s not
uncommon for gun rights advocates to argue that gun control is a law enforcement matter
â€“ that preventing the more than 11,000 annual firearm homicides in the US is a matter of
keeping criminals from obtaining guns illegally. In the case of mass killings, itâ€™s
clear that better law enforcement could not have prevented these tragedies â€“ we would
need to change our firearms laws.

A few days ago, I had dinner with some old friends and we found ourselves talking about gun
control in the United States. One friend, originally from Bangladesh, found it unbelievable
that two mass shootings within a month wouldnâ€™t spark meaningful debate in the US
about gun control. The other three of us, all born in the US, agreedâ€Š but argued that
there was no chance these two tragic incidents would meaningfully shift the national
conversation.

My main interest as a media scholar is â€œ agenda setting â€� â€“ what topics
enter our media and our national debate, and which remain off the table. Elected officials
have an agenda-setting role, choosing to speak about some issues and not others, as does the
media, when it entertains a topic like the validity of Obamaâ€™s birth certificate ad
nauseum.

Iâ€™m deeply influenced by the ideas of Daniel Hallin ( Jay Rosen offers an excellent
introduction to his work on agenda setting ), who suggests that media coverage of political
ideas sorts those ideas into three spheres: consensus, legitimate controversy and
deviance. We donâ€™t bother arguing about consensus ideas: democracy is good, free
markets allocate resources better than central governments. Other ideas are too â€œfar
outâ€� to be considered: reallocating wealth so that thereâ€™s a much smaller gap
between rich and poor is exiled into the sphere of deviance by being labeled
â€œsocialismâ€�. What remains between these spheres â€“ not too widely
accepted, nor to radical to consider â€“ is what dominates newspaper headlines and the
Sunday talk shows.

One implication of Hallinâ€™s theory is that you can often achieve political change not
by winning an argument in the sphere of legitimate controversy, but by keeping your ideas in
the sphere of consensus and your opponentsâ€™ in the sphere of deviance. When New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie announces in the wake of the Aurora shootings , â€œâ€Šthis
is just not the appropriate time to be grandstanding about gun laws. Can we at least get through
the initial grief and tragedy for these families?â€�, we should read his apparent
compassion, in part, as an attempt to keep gun control out of the sphere of legitimate
controversy.

This theory also helps explain why the NRA fights all attempts to limit firearm ownership ,
including apparently common-sense legislation like a proposed ban on high-capacity
magazines for pistols. If the NRA finds itself debating how many bullets a handgun should be
allowed to hold for reasonable self-defense purposes, gun control has entered the sphere of
legitimate controversy. Better to fight any attempts to restrict weapon sales as an assault
on the Second Ammendement and keep all talk of control in the sphere of deviance.

If elected officials, advocacy organizations and media â€œgatekeepersâ€�
fought for control of agenda setting twenty years ago, the battle now includes individuals
who produce and consume media, â€œthe people formerly known as the audienceâ€�, to
use Dan Gillmorâ€™s term . Bloggers and other social media users have figured out that
they can create media that questions ideas in the sphere of consensus, at advocates for ideas
in the sphere of deviance. Most of the time, these ideas get ignored; sometimes they get
amplified and end up influencing policy. Yochai Benkler uses the term â€œthe network
public sphereâ€� to refer to the media environment that includes and is influenced by
bloggers and others, and sees the successful fight against SOPA/PIPA as evidence that the
general public can change political agendas despite a process that all too often appears
captured by lobbyists and corporate interests.

Thereâ€™s another form of agenda setting powers individuals have: aggregated
interest. One of the reasons that media outlets cover reality television star and
existential philosopher Kim Kardashian is that we appear to have an insatiable appetite for
stories about her. News websites can and do monitor the traffic to each story they run and some
optimize their content to ensure we get more coverage of what we collectively show interest
in. If we collectively decided we were no longer interested in Kim Kardashian, she would
disappear â€“ not necessarily corporeally, but as a focus of media attention. If we
showed as much interest in gun control as in reality TV, itâ€™s likely weâ€™d see
more press coverage of the topic.

A blunt but effective tool to measure aggregated interest is Google Trends, which shows how
popular a search is on Google over the course of weeks or months. A search on Google Trends for
â€œgun controlâ€� shows a peak in interest in that search topic over the past few
weeks, while the Aurora shooting has dominated the news. Itâ€™s not the highest peak in
interest, though â€“ that happened after the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007. And Google
Trends suggests that there roughly as much interest in gun control around the 2004
presidential election as there is was in the wake of Aurora.

Click image to enlarge

I created a simple mashup of two data sets â€“ Google Trends data on â€œgun
controlâ€� and data from the Mother Jones researchers on mass shootings. Many mass
shootings correlate to surges of interest in â€œgun controlâ€�, but not all. The
shootings at Fort Hood, TX in late 2009 were committed by an Army major â€“ itâ€™s
unlikely that any gun control proposals on the table would keep arms out of the hands of
military personnel. (And itâ€™s likely that the shooting, by a man of Palestinian
descent who was in communication with extremist clerics, sparked conversation about
controlling the spread of â€œradical Islamâ€� instead.) But we can see peaks in
search interest around the Virginia Tech shootings, a shooting late that year at a mall in
Omaha, Nebraska, around the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson
Arizona, and now around the shooting in Aurora. ( Naunihal Singhâ€™s contention in the
New Yorker that the media treated the shootings in Oak Creek with less interest than those in
Aurora is echoed in the Google data â€“ thereâ€™s no major surge in interest in gun
control around the second shooting, while thereâ€™s a dramatic peak associated with
Aurora.) Itâ€™s worth noting that thereâ€™s a surge in search interest in
â€œgun controlâ€� in November 2008 that doesnâ€™t correlate to any
shootings: it appears to be a response to the election of Barack Obama and may reflect a
widespread (though misplaced) fear that Obama was likely to pass strong legislation
restricting gun ownership.

In other words, Chris Christie is being absurd when he demands that gun control advocates
desist from their work in the aftermath of a shooting for using the aftermath of a shooting
â€“ this is precisely the moment for advocates to seize, as there simply wonâ€™t be
nearly as much interest in the topic in a couple of weeks.

It takes an enormous amount of effort to bring a novel issue into the sphere of legitimate
debate. One of the reasons Invisible Children generated so much conversation around their
Kony2012 video in media cricitism circles is that they did something very, very difficult:
took an issue that most Americans didnâ€™t know existed and made it a topic for debate for
a few weeks. Raising attention â€œex nihiloâ€� is pretty rare (and Invisible
Children did it by leveraging a cadre of youth who were paying attention to this issue for
months or years). Itâ€™s more common to find a phenomenon thatâ€™s attracting
attention and reframe the issue to suit your advocacy goals.

Trayvon Martinâ€™s parents worked very hard to bring attention to his story once the
â€œnews windowâ€� had closed. Once the story was the center of widespread media
attention, we might have expected a surge of search interest in â€œgun controlâ€�.
(Googleâ€™s data shows no surge.) Instead, MoveOn.org and other progressive
organizations took advantage of the attention to Trayvon and shifted the frame to focus on the
American Legislative Exchange Council, which drafted legislation that became
Floridaâ€™s â€œStand Your Groundâ€� law. ALEC has lost 28 corporate members
since the Trayvon case , which suggests that the advocacy campaign was successful. But
itâ€™s possible that a campaign against civilian handgun ownership might also have
been successful, had advocates attempted to steer attention towards that framing of issues.

Attention to the Aurora and Oak City shootings is turning into advocacy for stronger gun
control in some corners of the US. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that curbing
gun violence will be a major priority for his next legislative session. New York, however,
already has some of the nationâ€™s strongest gun laws , and itâ€™s far from clear
that other governors will react in the same way. The Brady Campaign, one of the USâ€™s
leading gun control organizations, has announced a campaign to pressure Presidential
debate host Jim Lehrer to ask Obama and Romney a question about gun control .

In other words, with 97 dead or injured in mass shootings in 2012, the Brady Campaign
recognizes that gun control is so far in the sphere of deviance that it could take a petition
campaign to get either Presidential candidate to address the topic. Thatâ€™s the power
of agenda setting.

At our dinner party, the three of us born in the US tried to persuade our Bangladeshi friend that
one consolation to the American system is that the principle of stateâ€™s rights
ensures that some states will be saner on gun control than others, and that Massachusetts has
very tough gun laws. (Theyâ€™re tough enough that I canâ€™t accept a gift of a
shotgun â€“ which I use to shoot skeet when in Texas â€“ from my father-in-law until
I complete a 16 hour hunter education course. And, inconvenient as this is, I think
itâ€™s a good policy.)

Of course, the toughness of those state laws is under attack as well. â€œConcealed-carry
reciprocityâ€� is a major legislative priority for the NRA, which seeks to ensure that a
person licensed to conceal a handgun in a state with loose gun restrictions can do so in states
with stricter laws. Writing in Businessweek , Paul Barrett predicts that this issue will come
up in the Vice Presidential debate, as Paul Ryan is a supporter of reciprocity legislation. So
perhaps we can hope for debate about gun control in the USâ€Š but the debate is likely to be
about less control, not more. Permalink

How do we make civic crowdfunding awesome?



...My heart's in Accra 10 Aug 2012, 9:04 pm CEST



Ten people each contribute $100 a month into a pool. They meet once a month and discuss possible
projects to support. Each month, they give a grant of $1000 to a project that meets a simple
criterion: itâ€™s awesome.

Thatâ€™s the logic behind the Awesome Foundation , founded by Tim Hwang and friends,
brilliantly built and managed by Christia Xu . Awesome Foundation now has 50 chapters in 10
countries and has given 252 grants, sponsoring awesome projects like Float , which attaches
air pollution sensors to kites to report on air quality, and Free the Billboards , which
invites people to visualize alternatives to unsightly billboards by photobombing them.
(Full disclosure â€“ Iâ€™m on the board of Institute for Higher Awesome Studies ,
the shadowy organization that acts as an umbrella organization for the individual Awesome
chapters.)

This July, Christina and the Awesome Foundation convened a gathering at the MIT Media Lab to
discuss new approaches to philanthropy. ( Center for Civic Media blogged the conference , in
case you want to catch up on all the cleverness you missed.) Featured at the table were
well-known efforts like Kickstarter, and less visible efforts like SmallKnot , which helps
local businesses raise investment capital from their customers, rewarding investments
with premium products that are far cooler than tote bags or coffee mugs.

What these new approaches â€“ commonly called â€œcrowdfundingâ€� â€“
have in common is that they seek to democratize philanthropy. Why should George Soros and Bill
Gates have all the fun, deciding where charitable money goes? Roughly 80% of American give
time or money to charities , but very few are involved with deciding how those funds get
allocated. Thatâ€™s changing with efforts like Donors Choose and Global Giving , which
allow donors to pick the projects they want to help. Awesome goes a step further â€“ all
the management of the giving process comes from the donors.

Iâ€™m an enthusiastic supporter of crowdfunding, whether itâ€™s designed to
support charitable efforts, invest in art projects or fund businesses. But, as I sat at the
Awesome Summit, blogging talks about inspiring new efforts, I found myself starting to think
about the unanticipated downsides of this form of organizing.

Hereâ€™s a project thatâ€™s unlikely to succeed, but exemplifies some of my
worries. Kansas City was denied funds from the US Department of Transportation to build a new
streetcar line. Jase Wilson is now trying to raise $10 million towards the streetcar on his
site, neighbor.ly , designed to enable investment in â€œcivic projects.â€� (So
far, only $3600 has been pledged towards the goal . Ethan Mollickâ€™s research on
Kickstarter suggests that Wilsonâ€™s project is following a pretty common pattern of
failing bigâ€Š the majority of projects success by small margins, and those that fail
often fall far short.)

Writing on TechPresident , Miranda Neubauer points to two other civic crowdfunding sites:
Citizinvestor and Patronhood, which hasnâ€™t yet launched. In the UK, Spacehive
allows similar crowdfunding projects and can boast an enormous success, with nearly
800,000Â£ raised for a community center in Glyncoch, Wales . (Itâ€™s worth noting
that most of the funds for the center came from government, with roughly 2000Â£ coming from
community donations.) Brickstarter is pursuing a similar model in Helsinki.

Alexandra Lange calls these type of projects â€œKickstarter Urbanismâ€� , and she
warns that they are far from guaranteed to succeed. She points to funding for The LowLine
â€“ a proposed underground park in an abandoned trolley terminal â€“ as a widely
discussed project in this space. The $155,000 raised by the LowLine isnâ€™t building
the park, but allowing the park designers to build a demonstration installation, proving
their fiberoptic lighting technique works. Actually building the park, Lange warns, is much
more complicated â€“ itâ€™s going to require massive bureaucratic wrangling to
get the space permitted and supported as a public park.

Lange suggests that Kickstarter works best as a way to sell goods. The projects that have
raised massively more funds than they sought, like the Pebble watch , are most frequently ones
where your pledge purchases a product. Kickstarter allows a designer to aggregate
sufficient demand to make creating a product feasible. I recently backed a (failed) project
that sought to build a toy action figure of Rama â€“ the project sought $125,000 to cut
custom molds for the toy. Had it succeeded, a $35 pledge would have bought me a very cool action
figure for my son. Other successful projects function as pre-sales systems for audio
recordings or documentaries.

But parks arenâ€™t products â€“ they are public goods. And thatâ€™s where my
concerns about civic crowdsourcing begin.

The right in the US, led by anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, has been fighting a war against
government spending that is, in effect, war on public goods and services. Norquistâ€™s
conviction that private sector enterprise is inevitably more efficient and less corrupt
than the government has led to the privatization of services once provided by the government,
like prisons and defense, and elimination of other key services once tax revenues no longer
support their provision. A recent episode of This American Life â€“ featuring an
interview with Norquist â€“ makes clear that the elimination of public goods is no
accident. Demanding that Republican politicians sign a pledge not to increase taxes is about
forcing a crisis that will lead to elimination of programs and shrinking of government.

Sometimes, this shrinkage means that public services we rely on no longer work very well. This
American Life interviews government officials in Trenton, New Jersey, where massive cuts to
the police department have led to dramatic increases in crime . At other times, it means
services are only available if we pay for them. Colorado Springs turned off streetlights ,
stopped maintaining public parks and cut public transit when voters didnâ€™t pass a tax
increase. Affected citizens could pay to â€œadoptâ€� a streetlight turned off by
the government, paying $75 for a service that had previously been provided by the city. ( The
city council has abandoned this program , in part due to adverse publicity, and â€œall
residential streetlights are in the process of being reactivatedâ€�.)

When an underfunded police department canâ€™t prevent crime, it sends a message: the
government isnâ€™t doing a competent job, so perhaps we should look for alternatives,
like private security forces for neighborhoods who can afford to hire them . When community
efforts to maintain a park , despite cuts in government funding, succeed, they send the
message that we donâ€™t need the government to provide a public service, as volunteers
will take care of it. (This was the genius of George H.W. Bushâ€™s â€œ thousand
points of light â€� â€“ Americans love the ideas of volunteerism and community
organizations, and if those organizations can serve the public, why should government
provide the services they can provide?) Whatever the outcome, positive or negative,
Norquistâ€™s experiments â€œproveâ€� that we need less government and
fewer goods and services provided by the government.

The impact of cuts to public services is not evenly distributed. Cuts to public transport
donâ€™t dramatically affect people who own cars and use them to commute to work. Closure
of public parks matters less to people who can afford country club memberships or the dues at a
gym or YMCA. This uneven impact on the poor turns these cuts into a social wedge â€“ the tax
savings disproportionately benefit the rich and service reductions harm the poor, sparking
debate on whether wealthy people should be required to subsidize services to the less
privileged.

When Colorado Springs turned off the streetlights in 2010, they launched a secure website
that allowed residents to log on and pay to turn their lights back on. Itâ€™s not hard to
imagine a cash-strapped municipality taking a list of parks they canâ€™t build or
maintain posting projects to Kickstarter or Neighbor.ly, seeking crowdfunding for their
support.

I think that would probably be a bad thing. Unless done very carefully, crowdfunding a
cityâ€™s projects is likely to favor wealthy neighborhoods over poor ones. People in
poorer neighborhoods have less to spend on crowdfunding projects, and are less likely to have
internet access. If Langeâ€™s observation that people tend to Kickstart projects they
benefit from holds true, weâ€™d expect to see a wealth of parks funded in Brooklyn and few
in the Bronx.

But unfairness isnâ€™t the only problem. If crowdfunding parks succeeds, it supports
the case that governments donâ€™t need to build parks because theyâ€™ll get built
anyway through the magic of civic crowdfunding. That, in turn, supports the Norquistian
argument for a government small enough to drown in a bathtub, with services provided by the
free market and by crowdfunding a thousand points of light.

Is Jase Wilson, the guy whoâ€™s trying to fund the Kansas City streetcar line on
Neighbor.ly a secret agent of the radical right? Of course not â€“ heâ€™s a
well-intentioned guy whoâ€™s turning to a successful online model to support a project
he cares about. The nature of unintended consequences is that theyâ€™re the downside of
an otherwise worthwhile activity. Bringing neighbors together to make their neighborhood
better is a good thing. Figuring out how to do it while minimizing unwanted political impacts
is even better.

Civic crowdfunding is inevitable because itâ€™s so consonant with other forms of
internet-based organization. Thereâ€™s widespread acceptance of the idea that
software developers can build high-quality software, motivated not purely by financial
gain (though thereâ€™s certainly a role for commercial enterprises within the open
source ecosystem.) Wikipedia demonstrates that volunteers can produce a high quality
reference work. The campaigns against SOPA/PIPA and the Susan G. Komen Foundation show that
activists, loosely linked through the internet, can achieve social change. Civic
crowdfunding leverages many of the same mechanisms: rapid and lightweight group formation,
coordination of efforts, enlightened self interest.

Here are some thoughts on how we could embrace civic crowdfunding and avoid the downsides:

Avoid rhetoric that posits crowdfunding as a remedy for government inaction and failure.
Thereâ€™s a proud tradition on the left of building social services for communities
ignored or shortchanged by the government. I think of the Black Panthersâ€™ â€œ
Survival Programs â€œ, providing child nutrition, education and medical testing to the
African American community in Oakland, and more recently, efforts by the Occupy movement to
provide food to local homeless communities. Itâ€™s possible to provide these services
and argue â€“ as the Panthers did â€“ that these services are an alternative to
unfair government services. Itâ€™s also possible to argue, as Occupy has sometimes
done, that these services are an example of what we want governments to provide and a way of
pressuring government to do the right thing. This second argument is a healthier one, in light
of a sustained rightwing push against public goods and services.

Crowdfund projects that leverage existing government opportunities. ioby is a civic
crowdfunding site that seeks environmental change close to home â€“ â€œin our back
yardsâ€�. One of their featured projects is helping Latino communities in San
Francisco engage with a city planning process to convert unused lots into public parks. The
crowdfunding ask â€“ $5,185 â€“ isnâ€™t sufficient to build a park, but
itâ€™s enough to ensure that the Latino community in southern San Francisco can
participate in hearings and lobby city officials for their rights.

Use crowdfunding to brainstorm and innovate, and let governments implement. Crowdfunding
has been a powerful tool to bring innovative new design solutions to market. In the case of
civic innovation, the folks behind the LowLine may have the right idea â€“ crowdfunding
can help bring attention to a civic project and enable an innovative prototype design, but
actual implementation will surely involve the city of New York. Finding ways to cooperate
with governments to sustain new public spaces, works of art, etc. is surely going to be a key
part of civic crowdfunding projects going forward, and ensuring that projects have built
appropriate government ties should be a criterion for evaluating viable projects.

Look for projects that create community capital through volunteering. One of the promises of
civic crowdfunding is that it builds stronger neighborhoods and communities. We know that
participating in volunteer activities, like Kaboom!â€™s efforts to build
playgrounds , helps build local civic capital. Letâ€™s encourage projects that want
our time and input, as well as our dollars â€“ civic crowdsourcing as well as
crowdfunding.

Donâ€™t let governments dump unfunded projects into civic crowdsourcing. Instead,
letâ€™s look for ways that people excited about civic crowdfunding can lobby and ensure
that city, state and federal funding for transportation, public spaces and the arts
isnâ€™t cut any further. Civic crowdfunding should be about making public goods and
services more awesome, not shifting responsibility onto the backs of internet-connected
donors. Permalink

The Summer of Our Discontent



Umair Haque 3 Aug 2012, 1:00 pm CEST



Happy Summer! Time for a quick quiz. First, what's your favorite scandal of the year so far?
Interest rate rigging , phone hacking , up to 30% of global GDP squirreled away in tax havens ,
the fiasco in Rio , G4S, the desperate selling their organs , or the brand police at the
XXXLympics that might not let you wear your Nikes? Second, name me an institution that works
â€” as a reasonable person might expect it to. Here are a few probably not on your list:
banks, governments, schools, the media, corporations. Now, I will not ask whether you trust
institutions â€” odds are, you don't . Instead, here is my question: should you trust
yesterday's institutions? Some would argue that today, brothers and sisters, we enjoy
bigger TVs and SUVs than ever before â€” comrades, all hail the noble spirit of
capitalism! Others might say, as the great Deirdre McCloskey has eloquently suggested, that
there was a wee bit more to the case for capitalism than the accumulation of stuff; that the
truer case for a political economy centered on capital and grounded in the pursuit of
prosperity rested on its power to evoke and elevate the worthiest in us. Forgive me for
suggesting so, but whether or not you and I have 3D TVs the size of MegaCorp Stadium, phones that
let us take smiling pictures of ourselves to put on internet dating websites (because, you
know, humans never satisfyingly reproduced before the Golden Age of Digital Technology),
and running shoes that look, every season, a little more like the alien sharks of planet Europa
is almost besides the point. In between the two poles of this time-honoured argument over
whether capitalism is, as John Maynard Keynes put it, fair to be foul â€” or foul to be fair
â€” lie what I'd suggest are a pragmatic set of truths. If tomorrow's institutions are to
again earn the trust of today's suspicious, anxious, weary, jaded, angry people â€”
then, at the very least, among the following will be requirements: That the fruits of
prosperity are more justly distributed than the six heirs to the Walmart fortune being worth
as much as the bottom 48.8 million households in America . That the super-rich don't appear to
be a class to themselves, above the law that applies to the common folk. That those who helm
institutions aren't able to use them as tools to line their pockets with impunity. That
rewards aren't merely in proportion to "risk" â€” but that risk rests squarely on the
broad shoulders of the risk-taker , not the hunched, huddled masses. That rewards are in
proportion to real, enduring wealth ; that merely shuffling paper chits in a ponzi scheme
isn't a means to eye-watering fortune. That if there are to be billionaires in an enlightened
society, their accomplishments should, can, and must add up to more than the sum total of the
big box store, the mall, the climate catastrophe, the never-ending financial disaster, and
the panic attack about the no-future future. That, above all, the rules of the game, if obeyed
to the letter, don't leave us broke, miserable, lonely, unhealthy, and empty; that, at the end
of the day, institutions and their so-called leaders don't offer people a future made out of
pink slime , then retreat to the limo for their own SuperPremiumElite reserve of foie gras. But
the challenge isn't merely "fixing" the broken relationship between institutions and
individuals â€” preserving the status quo in a Damien Hirst-esque tub of cloudy green
formaldehyde. The challenge is reimagining that relationship, and then rebuilding it
â€” so, maybe, just maybe, you, I and our grandkids can inhabit economies, societies,
and polities that are fundamentally better. I know. I'm a hopeless romantic, a laughable
optimist. But for a system to have legitimacy in the eyes of the people that consent to be
governed by it, it must not be perceived to be grossly unfair. And the alternative, of course,
is the headlines.

Author's note: Clearly, these are my own impressions... but I'm curious: do you trust
institutions? Should you? If you don't, was there a specific, formative life event that
caused you to lose faith in our institutions?

In the network economy, ownership is fragmented...



KK Lifestream 26 Jul 2012, 8:31 pm CEST

Originally posted in New Rules

...into myriad parts, sped along electronic pathways, and dispersed among workers, venture
capitalists, investors, alliance members, outsiders, and, in minute doses, even to
competitors. Networks breed swarm capitalism.

Yet as networks rise, the center recedes. It is no coincidence that global networks appear at
the same time as the postmodern literary movement. In postmodernism, there is no central
authority, no universal dogma, no foundational ethic. The theme of postmodernism in the
arts, science, and politics is summed up by Steven Best and Douglas Kellner in their book The
Postmodern Turn : "The postmodern turn results in fragmentation, instability,
indeterminacy, and uncertainty." This also sums up the net.

Network principles renounce rigidity, closed structure, universal schemes, central
authority, and fixed values. Instead networks offer up plurality, differences, ambiguity,
incompleteness, contingency, and multiplicity . These qualities are ideal for disruption,
for the spread of networked-organized crime, and for fostering the lack of shared values.

Happy distractions: sumo, South African music, and Islamic hackerfic



...My heart's in Accra 18 Jul 2012, 3:44 pm CEST



This year is the first in decades where Iâ€™ve been beneficiary and victim of the
academic schedule. While I spent almost a decade at the Berkman Center, research at that
institution continues year-round, and thereâ€™s not much of a summer lull. The Media
Lab is closer to the traditional academic cycle, as many students head out of the lab for
internships and many of the professors hole up to complete research and writing.

Iâ€™m trying to follow their lead and am revising the book Iâ€™ve been working on
for the past two years, towards a spring publication date. And that, in turn, has given me a good
chance to think about distraction.

Like many people, Iâ€™m highly distractible. I do my best work in public places â€“
coffee shops, libraries, airplanes â€“ because they eliminate some of my favorite ways
of wasting time: cutting weeds in my back yard, investigating the contents of my
refrigerator, roaming the lab to see if thereâ€™s anyone interesting around to talk to.
But when youâ€™re writing a book on the Internet, itâ€™s very hard to eliminate
online distractions without cutting yourself off from your research subject. (And, if
youâ€™re sufficiently skilled at distractibility, youâ€™ll find ways to
convince yourself that the website youâ€™re frenetically clicking through is somehow
related to your core research topics.)

So, hereâ€™s whatâ€™s most distracting me today:

Weâ€™re nearing the end of the Nagoya basho, sumoâ€™s summer tournament. Two of my
favorites, Yokozuna Hakuho and Ozeki Harumafuji are both undefeated at 11-0, and everyone
who follows the sport is hoping to a showdown of the two on the final day.

Highlights from day 10 of the Nagoya Basho.

Sumoâ€™s getting much easier to watch thanks to the efforts of â€œ Kintamayama
â€œ, whose YouTube profile identifies himself as a 58 year old dude from Tel Aviv. He posts
daily summaries of the basho, evidently edited from the match livestreams. Iâ€™m not
able to watch the livestream, which airs in the early morning my time, so I generally rely on
torrents of NHKâ€™s English language coverage. Those take hours to find and download,
and theyâ€™re three hours long, featuring all the pre-bout ritual theatrics that
accompany sumo. Kintamayama cuts to the chase â€“ his ten minute videos feature the key
high-level bouts and occasional highlights from the lower ranks, with English language
information on who won and with what throw. As a bonus, his snarky subtitles during judges
deliberations are always worth a watch.

While my favorite Mongolians are dominating this basho, much as theyâ€™re kicking ass
in the global economy , itâ€™s wonderful to see a veritable United Nations competing at
the high ranks of sumo. The Japanese are back in force at the Ozeki rank, with Kisenosato and
Kotoshugiko. Baruto weighs in from Estonia (heâ€™s 200kg, so thatâ€™s a pun,
people) and Kotooshu from Bulgaria ensure that eastern Europe is well represented at the top
ranks of the sport. Iâ€™ve been having a lot of fun this basho watching Kaisei , a powerful
Brazilian rikishi whoâ€™s been having a great tournament.

If youâ€™re interested in following the next four days of the bout, try:
Kintamayamaâ€™s YouTube channel Asahi Shimbunâ€™s excellent
English-language sumo coverage Sumo Forum





Sumoâ€™s great for wasting at least half an hour a day, watching the matches and reading
up on the most impressive competitors, but to truly lose hours of productive time,
thereâ€™s no pastime like tracking down obscure records from the 1970s and 80s. Eric
Kleptone , the legendary remixer and prankster behind projects like â€œYoshimi Battles
the Hip-Hop Robotsâ€�, has recently turned his attentions towards one of the great
musicological mysteries of our time: the identity of the album that inspired Paul Simon to
travel to South Africa and record his â€œGracelandâ€� album. ( Iâ€™ve
written at length about Paul Simon, â€œGracelandâ€� and the controversies over
the album.)

Simon legendarily received a cassette tape from a friend, titled â€œAccordion Jive
Hits, Volume 2â€³ that inspired him to discover South African mbaqanga music. But, as
numerous frustrated African music fans have discovered, no album by that title exists.
Kleptone discusses the possible provenance of the album in the notes for his mix, Paths to
Graceland , which is an attempt to catalog possible influences that might have led Simon to
South Africa. Itâ€™s a gorgeous, lively and beautiful mix, filled with music
thatâ€™s new to my ears, but so clearly kin to the music Simon featured that it seems like I
must have heard it decades ago.



The rabbit hole Kleptone opens is through providing a thorough track listing, which leads me
to discover that Tau Ea Lesotho is responsible for the accordion and high-octave bass guitar
that causes me to engage in spontaneous, uncontrollable chair dancing. And that, in turn,
leads me onto blogs like Afro Slabs , which work to track down and digitize these amazing albums
. Itâ€™s probably possible to track down all the albums Kleptone references and build
your own collection of early 80s South African and Lesotho music â€“ I appear to be doing
so without really trying to.





Of course, if you truly want to ensure no progress is made on a massive project like a book
revision, youâ€™ll need to get lost in a book. Iâ€™m currently ensnared by G.
Willow Wilsonâ€™s â€œ Alif the Unseen â€œ. My wife is a huge Wilson fan, and has
reviewed her graphic novel Cairo , and her memoir about conversion to Islam, The Butterfly
Mosque , but Alif is the first book of hers sheâ€™s pressed on me. I understand why
â€“ Salon describes the book as â€œ hacker meets djinn â€œ, and the novel is an
amazing tale of an alpha geek who works to protect online speech in the Arab world and a world of
sinister, dark magical realism.

Itâ€™s a badass scifi yarn, with lots of provocative ideas about Islam, freedom,
submission, will, gender, culture and independence. And as someone who works with
dissidents around the world, including the Persian Gulf, it raises challenging and
uncomfortable questions about the power and limits of speech to create change. Iâ€™m
enjoying the adventure of the story, but suspect Iâ€™ll be savoring the larger
questions for weeks to come.





My hope is that, like singing an earworm aloud to banish it, honoring these worthy
distractions will give me a few hours of focus. Or, perhaps theyâ€™ll simply pull you
down to my level of happy unproductivity. Permalink

Kenya, power and questioning my assumptions



...My heart's in Accra 10 Jul 2012, 11:32 pm CEST



Iâ€™m discovering that one of my special joys in life is having my presumptions proved
wrong.

Iâ€™ve just returned from a ten day trip to Kenya, helping host the fifth Global Voices
summit, attending board meetings for two companies, and helping my students research an idea
weâ€™re playing with at the Media Lab. Our idea is a simple one â€“ we want to help
people in nations where electric power is scarce sell power to their neighbors. Weâ€™re
designing a piece of prototype hardware that plugs into a diesel generator or other power
source, distributes the power to multiple outlets, monitors how much power is used and
charges the customer for the power they consume.

Kenya is a great place to try this idea out, because itâ€™s got one of the most mature
electronic payment infrastructures in the world. Built on top of Safaricomâ€™s mobile
phone network, M-PESA is a money transfer system that allows phone users to send payments to
one another as an encrypted SMS. If I want to pay my taxi driver 2000Ksh for the ride from
downtown to the airport, I can access M-PESA on my phone, enter the size of payment and his
mobile number, and heâ€™ll receive an SMS within a few seconds telling him the
transaction has been completed. Money comes in and out of the system via thousands of M-PESA
dealers, who work in towns of any substantial size, turning money into credit and vice versa.

Because this payment system is used by 70% of Kenyan adults, according to our friends at
Safaricom, it makes sense to try to build our power system on top of it. What weâ€™re
designing currently looks like a Kill-A-Watt â€“ a unit that monitors energy usage via
an ammeter â€“ and a M-PESA-enabled mobile phone. When we build it, it will probably
resemble a power strip with a SIM-card slot. Someone who owns a generator can plug our strip in,
then invite neighboring shops or homes to run 20-amp power cords to the strip. Each outlet on
the strip has a user ID, and the strip itself has an M-PESA ID. To turn on the power, a user sends
funds to the power stripâ€™s M-PESA account. The strip monitors usage, sends an SMS to
warn a customer when sheâ€™s low on power credit and shuts the power off when
sheâ€™s out of credit.

This might sound clever (or stupid) on paper, but itâ€™s hard to know what works until you
actually talk to the people youâ€™d like to use your product. If we were on a research trip
designed to focus on this product, weâ€™d have planned trips to a variety of
destinations: rural villages, secondary cities, refugee camps. But we were mostly coming to
attend the Global Voices conference, so our research was confined to Nairobi. We sought help
from our friends at Pawa254 , an arts center that works extensively in low-income communities
like Mathare, to find guides who could show us their neighborhoods and ask questions about
electricity.

And so on our first full day in Kenya, my students Nathan Matias, Matt Stempeck and I found
ourselves in a profoundly cramped car, with our new friends Addu and Mike, on Baba Dogo Road.
Baba Dogo was intended to be an industrial area on the outskirts of the city, and there are
several large manufacturing plants lining the road. But thereâ€™s also thousands of
people living here, in neighborhoods that have sprung up where land was empty and
inexpensive. Baba Dogo isnâ€™t the sort of â€œfamousâ€� slum like Kibera or
Mathare â€“ telling some of our Kenyan friends where weâ€™d done our research,
they told us weâ€™d been to an â€œupscale slumâ€�, the sort of distinction
that makes sense in a town like Nairobi, where slum tourism is a growth business. Sammi, a
musician who lives in the area, led us in on his motorbike, and proceeded to show us around town,
talking to the dozens of merchants who ran shops in the area.

Assumption one: I had assumed power would be scarce in Baba Dogo. Nope. Legal power is scarce,
but power is extremely common. Kenya Light and Power is quite good about extending the grid
into this neighborhood, though few houses are directly connected. Historically,
thatâ€™s because it was both expensive and time consuming to get a grid connection
â€“ friends tell horror stories of connections that cost more than $10,000 and took half
a year to get in place. Now connections cost closer to $350 and take only a weekâ€Š but
theyâ€™re still way out of reach of ordinary Baba Dogo residents. What usually happens
is that a single dwelling within an apartment building has a meter, and they distribute power
to their neighbors.

Gym, in Baba Dogo

in this case, brake drums and gears.

While this system works, itâ€™s hard to say that it works well. Letâ€™s take the
example of The Hardcore Gym, a weightlifting gym in a small building made of corrugated iron
sheets (where I embarrassed myself by failing to bench press the pile of brake drums and gears
this dude is easily liftingâ€Š) The gym needs electricity to power a TV and a satellite
dish, used to watch major football matches: that nightâ€™s Euro Cup semifinal between
Italy and Germany was 30Ksh a head, or about $0.40. The gym doesnâ€™t have a formal grid
connection, so the proprietor buys power from the house next door, for 200Ksh ($2.50) a month.
He doesnâ€™t know whether this is a fair price or not, as neither he or the homeowner can
monitor the power heâ€™s using. He lives in some fear that the homeowner wonâ€™t
pay the bills, and heâ€™ll be left without power â€“ this is pretty common, as a
homeowner may be selling power to dozens of people, pushing her bills very high. Sometimes,
another businessman told us, the person selling you power disappears, leaving tens of
thousands of shilling in debt to Kenya Light and Power and leaving everyone dependent on that
power source out of luck.

It isnâ€™t any more fun for the person selling power. Youâ€™re forced to collect
small sums from dozens of very poor people every month, and if they donâ€™t pay,
youâ€™re short of money to pay your own bills. Itâ€™s all the trouble of being a
landlord, with no legal system to fall back on (as what youâ€™re doing is illegal) and
where the safety risk is the strong chance of setting your house on fire. (One popular business
in Baba Dogo is metal fabrication, arc welding the ubiquitous gates and safety grills that
protect most structures here. Smart welders have their own special circuits negotiated with
the power companyâ€Š but not all are smart, and you can imagine the consequences of
plugging a 400 amp arc welder into a cord thatâ€™s been attached, makeshift, to a tangle
of homemade wiringâ€Š)

So, thereâ€™s power, but itâ€™s expensive, unpredictable and unreliable.
Whatâ€™s absent from the neighborhood are generators. Theyâ€™re simply too
expensive, even the cheap, dirty Tiger generators that are sold by the hundreds on River Road
in Nairobi. The customers for those generators are middle-class Kenyans, looking for backup
power when the grid fails, not the residents of Baba Dogo, seeking a primary source of power.



Image: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8002/7535154338_cc2faebe31.jpg An
â€œelectronics storeâ€� in Baba Dogo, offering phone charging services

Assumption two: I assumed people would be reluctant to pay for power. And while no one really
likes paying for power, people are willing to spend a fairly princely sum charging their
mobile phones. In Baba Dogo, powering up your phone involves finding an electronics shop,
leaving your phone for an hour or two, and retrieving your phone by paying 20 Ksh for the charge.
The sum â€“ about $0.25 â€“ doesnâ€™t sound like much, until you consider
that most products and services in this neighborhood are priced for the very poor. Browsing at
the neighborhood cybercafe costs half a shilling per minute â€“ $0.40 per hour â€“
and users monitor their time online carefully. A CD filled with mp3s of popular Luo music cost
me 50 Ksh, a price that I assume included a fair amount of â€œtourist taxâ€�.

Hereâ€™s a better way to understand comparative cost: a project run by the Danish firm
Grundfos is building beautiful, reliable water systems in Kenyan communities that have no
access to clean water. Using a clever system that incorporates RFID tags and M-PESA as a
payment mechanism, theyâ€™re pumping clean well water into a storage tank and selling
it to villagers at 2 or 3 Ksh for 20 liters. Some systems arenâ€™t being used to capacity
because many villagers arenâ€™t able to pay the $0.03 it costs to fill a large jerry can
with water. Instead, they continue to use contaminated water from local streams, a
phenomenon that poses an ethical dilemma â€“ should Grundfos simply open the tap and let
everyone drink for free, or continue with an experiment that promises a sustainable, clean
water source over time?

How does charging a mobile phone become worth as much as 200 liters of clean water?

One brutally simple answer is that customers have an alternative when it comes to purchasing
water: they can get dirty water for free. Thereâ€™s no alternative when it comes to
power. Conventional economics suggests that, as power is a commodity, weâ€™d expect to
see sharp price competition until vendors were operating on very thin profit margins.
Instead, we see power providers settling on a price that seems high to me, but is evidently
sufficiently affordable that customers will pay. Itâ€™s unclear whether anyone is
trying to maintain cartel pricing and punishing defectors, or whether power vendors simply
have agreed that 20 shillings is a good price for customers to pay for the service.

Why would customers be willing to pay this much? Phones have become an indispensable
infrastructure in the developing world. If you are a carpenter, you probably donâ€™t
have an office or a shop â€“ you have a mobile phone number that people call if they want to
hire you. If youâ€™re a market trader, you use your phone constantly to figure out what
prices are in other parts of a city or the country. If youâ€™re seeking a business permit,
you call before you visit an office, so you donâ€™t waste time on transport if the person
you need to see is out. Even independent of payment systems like M-PESA, a phone is a difference
between being an economic actor in Kenya and being outside the economy.

Which bring us to questionable assumption three: I thought it would be difficult to convince
people to think of themselves as becoming micro-scale power companies. Actually, people
grasped this idea right away, and wanted to know how much flexibility they would have over
pricing. (Answer: we hadnâ€™t really thought about it, but it seems like thatâ€™s
going to be critical to product success.) People also explained to us that everyone in Baba
Dogo is already an entrepreneur of one fashion or another â€“ selling power was a natural
extension of existing businesses. But we had to understand that not all commerce in the
neighborhood was about the exchange of money for goods or services â€“ often businesses
provide favors to one another in complex webs of obligation.



Image: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8026/7535161364_f6a35f2ab4.jpg The local
liquor store, seen from Sammiâ€™s apartment

We discovered the complexity of these webs when we tried to get a taxi out of the neighborhood.
Weâ€™d passed a few well-washed, shiny taxis with wooden signs on top that advertised
their availability. But when we asked Sammi to help us negotiate with a cab driver, he quickly
found someone who lived in his apartment building. His car wasnâ€™t shiny â€“
indeed, the windows didnâ€™t open because the owner was trying to repair the controls,
which meant that our ride was unpleasantly sweaty. And we noticed that he wasnâ€™t a very
good driverâ€Š which he explained by pulling over and picking up his driver,
â€œbecause I have only been driving for a few weeks, and I am not very good.â€� So our
attempt to hire a taxi turned into hiring a car from a mechanic who was repairing it, and a driver
capable of driving it. Why this was an optimal solution, only Sammi knows â€“
itâ€™s possible he shared some of the (extremely high) fare we paid, or that he had other
obligations to his neighbors that required us to hire this adhoc taxi, instead of an official
one.

The ability to pay with favors as well as with money is something we need to take seriously if we
want people to use our product. Itâ€™s important, therefore, that we find a way to make
our device usable in ways other than pre-paid, so that someone with access to power could loan
power to someone who wasnâ€™t able to pay, in exchange for another good, service or
favor.

Assumption four: I figured neighborhoods like Baba Dogo would be the right place to try this
product out. Theyâ€™re probably not, as theyâ€™re already too well wired. This
isnâ€™t to say that thereâ€™s no demand for our device in Baba Dogo â€“ I had
the sense we could probably sell a few dozen, with Sammi as our local pitchman. (After all, if he
can sell me on a taxi ride without windows or a driver, he can surely sell out device.) But
itâ€™s likely that the use case in Baba Dogo is to use our meter to share a connection from
Kenya Power and Lighting with other usersâ€Š and itâ€™s quite possible Kenya Power
would be unenthusiastic about this use case. (On the other hand, they might welcome this as an
alternative to dangerous and adhoc wiring solutions that are already pervasive in
high-density neighborhoods.)

Our better use cases are likely in areas where thereâ€™s no power other than generator,
solar or water power. In some cases, these may be communities where the power grid
doesnâ€™t yet extend, but have GSM coverage. In other cases, they may be refugee camps,
unlikely to be wired for fear the camps will turn into permanent settlements. Thereâ€™s
something oddly encouraging about discovering that Nairobiâ€™s slums are too
advanced for our proposed product â€“ thereâ€™s no shortage of other markets
where access to power is a major problem and where our solution may prove helpful.

For me, the visit to Baba Dogo â€“ and other visits my students took while we were in Kenya
â€“ is a helpful counterbalance to the unlimited possibilities of the Media Lab.
Iâ€™ve argued for years that culture matters as much as technology when youâ€™re
designing new products. Being surrounded by roboticists and synthetic biologists is a great
inspiration to look for novel technical inspirations, but itâ€™s worth trying these
ideas out in the field early and often. While itâ€™s frustrating to discover that many of
my assumptions were wrong in pursuing this project, it would be vastly more frustrating to
learn this six months from now, having developed an inappropriate prototype for the wrong
market.

More photos from our trip to Baba Dogo. Many thanks to our friends for showing us around their
neighborhood, and everyone who was willing to share their thoughts about electric power and
microeconomicsâ€Š Permalink

Declare Your Radicalness



Umair Haque 4 Jul 2012, 2:06 pm CEST



Consider what I'd call the paradox of radicalism. Everywhere, we â€” especially
Americans â€” are told that we're the inheritors of the legacies of plucky adventurers,
grand risk-takers, resolute pioneers; those with the courage and sheer impertinence to defy
a status quo that tried its damnedest to stop them from creating a future that was brighter than
the drab present they refused to settle for.

Everywhere, and especially today, we celebrate the spirit and ethos of radicalism; still, we
fly flags vibrant with the colors of the radicals of yesteryear.

When it comes down to it, we spend our days sucking out each others souls in bureaucratic
organizations in which adding a new word to a slogan for a character that doesn't really exist
whose purpose is selling more pointless junk so people can spend money they don't really have
to live lives they don't really want for reasons that don't matter is considered risky.

In other words, we're incrementalists. We may honor the radical â€” but we surround
ourselves with the banal, trivial, humdrum, and tedious.

When it comes to the expanse of history, compared to the great and grand, the audacious and
downright outrageous, our ideas are small and our appetites smaller â€” hey, did you get
that mega-jumbo peanut butter at the new Walmart? ; our visions are tiny and our dreams tinier
â€” hey, we're going to be the greatest luxury hotel in the world! ; our senses are stunted
and our emotions blunted â€” hey, let's hit the mall because what really makes people
feel alive, exhilarated is more generic plastic disposable junk.

Consider, as an example, the terms of our national, global debate: both sides are arguing on
how to get back to the status quo. One side argues that more spending will fuel a recovery. The
other, that less spending will...fuel a recovery. It's about painfully hobbling back to
square one â€” not taking a quantum leap past the finish line, into a better kind of race
entirely.

If this so-called debate often feels a little tedious, trivial, and about as in touch with
reality as Kim Kardashian is with Kibare, it's because it's a status quo-preserving debate.
It's a debate run by folks who are "conservative" in a thin, narrow, intellectual sense: what
they seem to want to conserve isn't the authentic politically conservative notion of
heritage, culture, tradition, or values, but simply "recovering" a system that makes the
super-rich super-richer, while blowing up the economy, the middle class, the planet, and
your future.

In status-quo preserving debates, both (or all) options are concerned with getting back to
square one; how to maintain the status quo ante. Status-quo- disrupting debates are
concerned with getting past square one; not merely restoring a system to a previous state, but
rebuilding the system for higher peaks of performance â€” perhaps with the
understanding that yesterday's local optima is what caused the system's collapse.

Status quo-preserving debates are the realm of the incrementalist. Careful and cautious,
the incrementalist's overriding concern is the past and present â€” not the future, and
certainly not possibility, exploration, or to-hell-with-it levels of Picasso-like
reinvention.

If there's a single idea that made America great, I'd argue it's the notion that, like every
human, every human creation has a cycle of life; and the new must supplant the old for
prosperity to come to fruition â€” and if there's a single idea that's making America
stagnate, I'd suggest it's the notion that the best we can do in the future is the best we were
able to do in the past.

Call me crazy, go ahead and sic the dream team of Dick Cheney, Ted Nugent, and Oscar the Grouch on
me, but I believe that we, each and every one of us, is capable of more than incrementally,
cautiously, timidly, option-3-in-slide-14-in-the-powerpoint-deck not so bad. I think
we're capable of radically, explosively, dangerously, laughably, hopelessly, impossibly
better.

And I think America is capable of it, too. After all, it's spent two centuries being the
world's, well, radicals, pioneering what history and aristocracy once scoffed at the
impossibility of: Economic ascendance? Check. Highest living standards in history? Check.
Moon landing? Check. Middle class? Check. Black president? Check.

But to do it, we can't merely call for a set of broken institutions to work slightly better, to
restore the present to the state of the past. We've got to redefine better ; to redesign the
future.

So given my admittedly ambitious definition, are there any radicals?

Here are just a few beginnings â€” none perfect, immaculate, nor pure â€” from
heroes of mine, dreamers and doers both, that might begin to meet the definition above. Paul
Romer's idea of charter cities â€” cities that import institutions from other states
â€” is totally radical. Michael Clemens' argument that a world without borders would be
a radically more prosperous world? Totally radical. So is Denmark's recent quantum leap to
Green GDP. Elon Musk's dangerous idea that space travel can be pioneered by enterprise.
Occupy Wall Street's idea of radically open, decentralized decision-making. The General
Assembly. Yancey and Perry at Kickstarter's sweet, quiet, lethally powerful idea that
people should have the power to fund projects they find meaningful â€” not just
financially beneficial. There are plenty more examples of nascent radicalism in Robert
Safian's excellent essay about " Generation Flux ." All are ideas that don't merely
desperately attempt to preserve a status quo more clapped out than China's rivers â€”
but aim squarely at toppling it; all take a quantum leap past the boundaries of the possible,
into the realm of the delectably impossible.

It's time for each and every of us to get a tiny bit more radical. Not as in "Man!! This new
toothpaste box is totally rad! Quick, call the CMO!!" â€” but as in: "We need better ways
to live, work, and play: institutions and ideas that are radically better than the ones we've
got now; rules that make human interaction not just lead to minor-league baby steps in
efficiency, productivity, and effectiveness â€” but quantum leaps in real human
prosperity."

So here's my tiny manifesto for bigger, better, badder ideas.

Seek the roots. If it's at times of megafailure that human organization needs radical ideas
and thinkers, then to become one, seek the deeper roots of crisis. Humdrum collapses and
workaday crashes can be solved by pruning the shoots â€” but historic crises, Great
Resets, in Richard Florida's terms, require paradigm shifts: sets of ideas that challenge
yesterday's cherished assumptions and beliefs. Like, for example, that the apex of human
prosperity is churning out more, bigger, faster, cheaper, now .

Reorient the branches. If it's a new paradigm you want to pioneer, once you've drafted a new set
of assumptions and beliefs, how will they be brought to life? Radical ideas need equally
radical vehicles for real-world acceleration; you probably wouldn't ask McDonald's to be
the official restaurant of the Olympics â€” and if you did, let's be honest: you'd be a bit
of a laughingstock . In stark contrast, Clemens' big idea of a world without borders is a
radical reorientation of the way many of us think about prosperity.

Reimagine fruition. What's the point of your radical new idea â€” in human terms? How
concisely can you express it? The apex of human prosperity isn't merely more, bigger, faster,
cheaper, now â€” but wiser, fitter, smarter, closer, tougher. Kickstarter reimagined
fruition: it's not just earning a few bucks from a stock, but seeing the projects you find
inspirational and meaningful come to life. My favourite example, though, is punk: a musical
form that ear-splittingly shattered the leisure-suited conventions of the
spread-collared bourgeoisie â€” that gave voice to the marginalized, powerless, and
their dissatisfaction.

Seed the system. For an idea to be radical in human terms, it's got to seed a system, nurture a
thriving jungle of human interaction â€” not just sell a product or pump up a bottom line,
all in the monochrome realm of the incremental. Consider Romer's idea of charter cities: it
makes new systems possible â€” new sets of interactions between nations, that make
entirely new kinds of institutions probable.

Are you a radical? If all you're concerned with is selling more junk â€” no matter how much
shinier than last quarter's, no matter how clever your latest turn of phrase, no matter how
elegant the drape of your cloak â€” forget it: you're about as radical as a mystery meat in
a McBurger. If your only goal is that yesterday's broken institutions work slightly less
dysfunctionally, my apologies â€” but perhaps you're just another defender of the
failed status quo.

Let me speak plainly. I don't suggest you get radical because a) it'll help you sell more junk b)
it'll help punkwash your reputation as a zombie overlord c) it'll instantly elevate you to the
pantheon of human accomplishment. In point of slightly painful fact, it'll probably earn you
ire, wrath, puzzlement, disdain, a little bit of fury, and plenty of raised eyebrows. The
alternative, of course, is the (perhaps comfortable) life you have, on the (perhaps
cosseted) terms you're living it â€” and like the good burghers and barons of yore, it
might be the case that you're more than "happy" with it. If, of course, the point of "life" is
merely to be something like a finely-tuxedoed spectator in the grand endeavor of human
accomplishment, desire, imagination, creation, disappointment, elevation, and
fulfillment; if the point of "life" is something like totally and completely missing the
point of life.

Here's the problem with incrementalism in a time of breakdown: it's a bit like asking a
mechanic to tune up your tasseled loafers for your pioneering voyage to the edges of
interstellar space. Sure, you can wear your tasseled loafers, incrementalists of the
universe. But make no mistake: if it's the tired realm of the clapped out possible you wish to
take a quantum leap beyond, you're going to need a rocket ship.

Sure, radicalism's dangerous. But what's even more is dangerous is not enough radicalism in a
time of mega-failure.

John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten, the great poet of punk, chronicler of a bygone era of desperate
decline, of a ferocious disillusionment, a loss of faith in a rotten, decaying, failing
system, once said simply: "Don't accept the old order. Get rid of it." In case you didn't
notice, he wasn't wearing baby-soft tasseled loafers. He was trying to build a noisy, messy,
belching, thunderous rocket ship â€” straight into the heart of the impossible future.

It's your move.

The Libor Scandal and the Price of Prosperity



Umair Haque 29 Jun 2012, 4:23 pm CEST



Awesome news. To the long, dismal list of fatally broken institutions â€” GDP,
governments, schools, corporations â€” we can add the mysterious Libor , and its
conveniently comfortable calculation . It's difficult to overstate what a pillar of the
global economy Libor is â€” it's used in setting interest rates that affect the daily
lives of pretty much every citizen of every advanced economy across the globe. And it's
difficult to overstate how troubling it is that this, too, is an institution rigged by the few,
for the few ; that this institution too, is, corrupted.

This scandal isn't about price-fixing. It's not about a bank. It's not even about power and
privilege, corruption and compromise. It's about life, tragedy, and human potential. It's
about the capacity to create a worthwhile future. It is, in short, about you and I, and the
places we seek for ourselves in the world.

Let me couch this for you in the pedestrian terms of financial hydraulics â€” the tawdry
terms which seem to substitute for thinking in what's become of our thin, shallow economic and
political discourse. The most basic function of a financial system is to price money. If a
financial system can't undertake that simple task effectively â€” if the price of money
is fixed like a roulette wheel stuck on red â€” all else must necessarily fail:
investment must become malinvestment, speculation must precede creation, "profit" must
become divorced from benefit, and wealth is effectively transferred from poor to rich, in a
form of quiet but lethally effective institutionalized theft.

Now, let me couch this for you in the human terms of political economy â€” the terms in
which you and I should rightly conceive of an "economy" as the sum of the enduring human good;
not merely as a set of pipes for the grease of finance to be injected into.

Who authors the destiny of nations? Which compact governs the relations between the
powerless and the privileged? Whose rights are sacrosanct? How are fortunes earned â€”
and spent? What does "wealth" mean? If money is in a basic sense a currency in which the fruits of
enterprise past are safely kept, to seed the soil of prosperity tomorrow â€” and if the
value of that money itself is corrupted â€” can one be said to be a participant in "an
economy"? Or is one more a pawn in a rigged game of self-destruction; a mark in a ponzi scheme; a
dull-eyed pack animal to which the engines of extraction are yoked? Does "freedom" â€”
in the most primitive sense, autonomy from the circumscription of one's own inalienable
rights, those basic liberties which don't just accrue to us, but inhere in us â€” still
allow one freedom? Who's who â€” master and servant, mechanism and operator, principal
and agent, sovereign and serf?

These are the terms of the debate we're not having. These are the words that are left unsaid.
These are the concepts and ideas on which prosperity itself was built. These are the unspoken
phrases that flit like ghosts through what's left stammeringly unspoken by the
finely-suited pundits and so-called "leaders" too cowering and afraid, too tempted and
silenced, too timid and too petrified to challenge the primacy of a system that's leaving
millions to choke on the fumes of the collapse of their own futures.

When, exactly, did it become acceptable to sell out? To become a sociopath for a few million
bucks? "Ah," you darkly mutter. "We all sell out." Yet on such a norm of easy
shoulder-shrugging compromise nothing great can be built. Unless you believe that Abraham
Lincoln, too, for a few extra bucks, might have joined Barclays as a Senior Advisor for "Human
Resources."

Our institutions are corrupted â€” but it's not just money that corrupted them. It's the
norms that you and I endorse, every second of every day, with every tiny decision we make, that
value money over meaning; privilege over purpose; expedience over development;
convenience over sophistication; McPleasure over eudaimonia; system over existence.
Tempted by a devil's bargain, deep down, in our defeated hearts, you and I have already
surrendered. Faintly, in the distance, we protest, we shout, we object. You and I consent to
the system. And the system consents to us.

"The banker rigged the rates, and stole from you and me." Who stole what from whom? Was it the
banker who stole a dollar a day from us â€” or we who stole a life worth living from the
banker? Who consents to a deal with the devil â€” you? Or you and the devil? When the deal is
struck, has the devil stolen your soul? Or have you stolen, for a few searing moments, the
devil's due? If the basis of the contracts that govern men is consent, have you and I, with our
furious pursuit of more-bigger-faster-cheaper-now-at-any-cost already consented to the
compact of our own undoing; already tempted the banker with the devil's glittering deal
â€” and damned the banker to tempt us right back?

Let me tell you a secret. There is no system. You and I aren't the system. The bankers aren't the
system. The politicans aren't the system. Whom and what we elevate to exalted office isn't the
system.

There are a multiplicity of systems. For example, I've proposed redesigning the economy
around the idea of a national balance sheet, which redefines profit and wealth to matter in
human terms. Simon Johnson and numerous others have proposed banks be broken, split,
limited. Roger Martin has proposed that the overweening pursuit of shareholder value be
upgraded to the pursuit of human value. Michael Porter has suggested that shared value be the
linchpin the economy is held together by. Gary Hamel has suggested we redesign the
corporation as more a vehicle for human accomplishment than a military machine. Richard
Florida has suggested that we optimize for creative capital â€” not just financial
capital. And that's just a tiny list.

One remains trapped in a life one doesn't fully live until one sees the multiplicity of one's
potentials; the possibilities one can arc towards. So it is with societies. We will, I'd
venture, remain trapped in these lives, in these places, by these institutions, until we see
that there is no system, but a multiplicity of systems. A multiplicity of systems â€”
arrayed in ranks, shepherded into first, second, third, and last place by the norms we share;
by the values we're capable of mustering. A range of design choices that, like life choices,
bend one's trajectory towards the heights â€” or into the depths.

Like lives, economies and societies must be chosen . Not merely decided upon, by tired,
fearful old men in ornate rooms â€” but actively chosen, and rechosen, constructed and
reconstructed, by the norms we choose to enact, and the values you and I choose to live, every
second of every day.

You and I â€” we are more than pawns, marks, algorithms, "consumers," margins. At our
highest and fullest, you and I are here in the human world. And the systems we consent in every
moment to be governed by, through the ideals and values we share, can damn us not just to deal
with the devil, but to become the devils â€” to evoke from one another the smallest and
worst in our natures.

And yet you and I must fight fatalism. There are billions of stars in this galaxy. We're moored
to a rock perched on the edge of a single one. There is no system. There is only the journey past
the edge of impossibility. Who's who, mechanism and operator, sovereign â€” and serf?

Ghanaian Ambitions



...My heart's in Accra 28 Jun 2012, 6:56 pm CEST



I spent Tuesday on the crowded roads of the northern suburbs of Accra, catching up with old
friends and marveling at transitions and transformations: those my friends have made, as
well as the changes made to a city I love and dearly miss.

When I lived in Accra, in the mid-1990s, the city proper ended a few miles from the downtown,
around the airport that serves the city. A trip to the University of Ghana at Legon felt like a
trip to the outermost suburbs, if not altogether to the bush. The neighborhoods around the
airport and university are now fully part of the city, blessed with hi-rise buildings,
expensive houses and well-maintained roads packed with traffic. Finding the edge of the city
now requires driving to the edges of the Accra state, to towns Iâ€™d only heard yelled by
tro-tro drivers, advertising the terminus of their routes.

With the help of Edmund, who works with my friends at PenPlusBytes , I traveled to Medie, Accra,
a suburb Iâ€™d visited roughly ten years past. My memories of the last trip were of a two
hour long ordeal over rutted roads, packed with traffic, to a place that had more in common with
Ghanaâ€™s rural villages than with its bustling capital. Now thereâ€™s a
well-paved four lane divided highway, complete with flyovers and exit rampsâ€Š most of
the way. The interruptions in infrastructure were a great reminder of what had come before
â€“ as we decelerated from 120kph to 50, it was like moving back into my memories of the
chaotic, crowded and slow city.

The building of the Nsawam Road, as well as the M1 and other major Accra highways has
transformed the geography and real estate of the city. My friend Bernard Woma was an ambitious
dreamer when he settled in Medie twelve years ago, moving from the crowded zongo of Nima to a
plot of farmland a kilometer from the execrable road into the city. I saw him in Accra on Monday
and he insisted I had to come to his house to see how things had changed. He wanted me to see that
heâ€™d made a sane investment, and itâ€™s clear heâ€™s right. I
hadnâ€™t expected some of what accompanied the transition: gated and planned
communities lining some stretches of the road, John Deere dealerships on others. Signboards
for herbalists, who now that theyâ€™re recognized as â€œtraditional
healersâ€� work in public, instead of in secret as juju men. More signboards for
evangelical churches. More excavators.

Bernard is one of the top traditional musicians in Ghana: when President Obama visited the
country, he played the traditional drum salute to welcome him, and he later gave drum lessons
to Michelle and the presidential daughters. His project for the last ten years has been the
building of the Dagara Music Center, his school to teach the dance, drumming and xylophone
traditions of the Dagara people. For years, Bernard has been spending the academic year in the
US, pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree at SUNY Fredonia and a masters in African Studies at
Indiana University, then returning to his home to teach his music to American students hardy
enough to brave the road to his home, sleep in his spare bedrooms and endure his mix of teaching,
teasing and good-natured hectoring.

Bernard in his drum room

He built it and they came. His courtyard is now a mosaic of signs painted by the different
college groups whoâ€™ve visited him. His equipment room features 20 of the massive
xylophones (gyil) he trains his students on. We stayed for lunch and I met half a dozen
students, staying in Bernardâ€™s house or a nearby hotel, taking lessons from
Bernardâ€™s extended family and circle of friends. As student drummers do, they began
beating patterns on the picnic table whenever a lull crept into the conversation and I found
myself drumming along, playing patterns I learned from Bernard almost twenty years ago.

As I headed out, Bernard was preparing his neatly painted Mercedes bus for a run to the airport
to pick up the next dozen students. Roughly a hundred students will pass through this summer,
some for a few days, some for weeks or months. A few years ago, Bernard would tour the US with his
dance company to support the nascent academy â€“ now the revenue from the summer
students allows him to focus on his studies while heâ€™s in the states.

When I studied with Bernard, it was a happy accident that followed from a run of rough luck. I
came to Ghana to study at the university at Legonâ€Š which was on strike the year I was
there. I started studying with teachers Iâ€™d been pointed to by friends in the
USâ€Š who turned out to have serious drinking and personal problems. Bernard found me
moping in a corner of the National Theatre and rescued me, offering to teach me. I
couldnâ€™t be more thrilled that hundreds of people are now getting the opportunity to
learn from the master, no happy accident necessary.





About 45 minutes away from Medie, over humorously rough roads, is the village of Berekuso, a
small farming town in the Eastern Region. On a hill above the village is a gloriously modern,
architecturally stunning university campus. And, as you might imagine, thereâ€™s a
story behind it.

Patrick Awuah left Ghana decades ago, first to attend Swarthmore College, and then to go on to a
successful career at Microsoft. About a decade ago, he returned home, determined to build a
world-class liberal arts college in Ghana, so that his children would have the opportunity to
get an education at home that prepared them for life anywhere in the world.

I visited Patrick for the first time about a decade ago, when his university was a small office
in the Labone neighborhood of Accra and some ambitious architectural drawings. I visited a
few years later and was impressed to find a small, compact college in a leafy Accra suburb, with
several dozen students training on a mix of liberal arts and IT skills. The library was an
overgrown shelf of books and the computer lab looked much like any of the cybercafes that dot
the city. Still, it was deeply impressive to me that heâ€™d navigated the academic
bureaucracy of Ghana and been able to start an accredited private university.

The main courtyard at Ashesi

None of that prepared me for the stunningly beautiful campus that now houses 500 students in
Berekuso. The main buildings are organized around a terraced, landscaped courtyard filled
with flowers. Tile-roofed dorms flank a basketball court and look out over the hills and the
village. Ashesi University is simply one of the most beautiful academic institutions
Iâ€™ve ever seen.

Patrick toured me around the campus along with Computer Science professor Dr. Ayonkor
Korsah, and we sat down with a handful of Ashesi faculty and students. It became clear very
quickly that itâ€™s not just the facilities of the university that are world class.
Ashesi is attracting some of the brightest young students in west Africa, and faculty who are
excited about teaching in a liberal arts tradition with a focus on project-based learning. We
talked about ways Ashesi faculty and students could engage the local community in research
and design experimentsâ€Š exactly the same set of questions I find myself asking as I try
to build the Center for Civic Media at MIT.

Patrick Awuah shows off the new campus

I admitted to Patrick that, when heâ€™d described the scale of his ambitions to me,
Iâ€™d assumed he was crazy. Now I find myself wondering whether Iâ€™ve been
thinking to small in building the institutions Iâ€™ve tried to build.





This trip was a precursor to the Global Voices Summit in Nairobi, my chance to reflect on the
community and site weâ€™ve built over the last eight years. My friend David Sasaki
helped put those matters into scale, reflecting that Facebook has also been around for about
eight years , and has had a trajectory that seems to humble anything else in comparison. But
thereâ€™s something to be said for judging the success of a project on their own
ambitions and merits. Iâ€™m thrilled for my friends Bernard and Patrick, and
challenged by their success in bringing their visions to scale. Hereâ€™s hoping that I
feel as proud reflecting on how far Global Voices has come once our summit is at a close.

The Rule of Transformation

Originally posted in The Technium

Copyright is a slippery realm. But here is a copyright case extraordinarily slippery. Both
parties have legitimate claims . One party is an origami artist and the other an abstract
painter who appropriates patterns.

I am all for appropriation, a venerable and necessary practice in art. I am also all for process
art, that is art created by processes, or in the process of making other stuff.



Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//imgres-1.jpeg

Andy Warhol appropriated the "found" image of a grocery store soup can. Roy Lichtenstien
appropriated the images found in comic books. Both are revered artists.

Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//imgres.jpeg

A few years ago street artist Shepard Fairey appropriated a photograph of Barack Obama to turn
into a poster; the photographer sued and that case is still pending.



Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//23387.jpeg

Painter Richard Prince appropriated photographer Patrick Cariou's rastafarian photos.
Prince lost in court.



Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//legalities30.jpeg

Jeff Koon appropriated a photograph for his sculpture on right; He lost.



Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//legalities30-1.jpeg

Here Jeff Koon appropriated a photograph of feet for a painting. He won.

In the latest case, painter Sarah Morris appropriated the crease pattern of Robert Lang's
origami folds. Lang is a origami genius. He helped NASA design satellite folding/unfolding
solar panels. He uses computers to devise folding patterns to create impossibly detailed 3D
organisms from a single piece of paper. The pattern on the left below will, when folded by him,
turn into a convincing Rhinocerous Beetle. The pattern is an intermediate artifact of the
origami process, often published for other origami fans.



Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//image.jpeg

Sarah Morris is a respected abstract painter, who has painted grids and geometric shapes, and
"found" patterns for decades, and has had major shows in major museums. Many of her early
paintings look origami folds.



Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//Endeavor.jpeg

So it was no big stretch when she started painting "found" origami fold patterns, adding
colors, removing lines here and there. One of the patterns she found was Lang's Beetle
pattern. Her painting of it is on the right.



Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//sarah_morris_fig_b.jpeg

Not just one pattern, but several.



Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//sarah_morris_copyright_infringement.jpeg

Lang claims that he has been displaying and even selling his fold patterns as art for years.
Morris claims she has been painting found patterns like this for years, and that she
"transforms" the found piece into something new. Just as Warhol transformed the soup can, and
Lichtenstein transformed the comic panel, from artifact into art.

I can see Lang's point and share his anguish, but in the end, I'd rule in Morris's favor, because
I think she has transformed the found artifact. I follow the question, "Is it bettered by the
borrower?" In this case, yes.

Did Warhol better the soup can? That is hard to say, but he did transform it. "Transformation"
works even better as a guide to these hard questions. Did Fairey transform the photo into a
poster? Yes. Did Morris transform Lang's crease pattern? Yes.

I find the notion of transformation is a pretty good question to ask about copyright
conundrums. Did the copier transform the work? If yes, then the derivative is not really a
"copy"; it's been transformed, mutated, improved, evolved. That is still a judgement call,
but it is the right question.

I See Cats

An artificial intelligence discovered cats on the internet.

Google researchers connected 16,000 computer cores together into a huge neural net (like the
network of neurons in your brain) and then used a software program to ask what it (the neural
net) "saw" in a pool of 1 million pictures downloaded randomly from the internet. This is
called "unsupervised learning" because the researchers and algos were not biasing the
program in certain directions. What it learned, or learned to see, what up to the program. So
what visual patterns did it notice? Google's AI program answered: Cats! It did not use the word
"cats" because no one had taught it cat-ness, but it presented the form of a cat face as what it
saw in the million of images. LOL!

It is not clear, but I believe the image of the cat below (from the NYT article by Markoff) is not
found on the internet, but is the image that emerged in the mind of the AI. This is what the neural
net "thinks" it "saw."



Image: http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//CATS-articleLarge.jpeg

The research mentioned in this abstract will be presented later this week.

This is one of the clearest advances in AI in a long time. We'll see how scaleable the
intelligence is once it is peer-reviewed. But imagine 1 million computer cores trying to see
what's on the internet. Oh, BTW, Google owns 1 million computer cores.

Electric Bicycles



KK Lifestream 26 Jun 2012, 10:17 pm CEST

Originally posted in Cool Tools

This is not an official Cool Tool Review.

I am trying out electric bicycles. Today e-bikes have a limited range of 20-30 miles (50km)
because of battery constraints. So most e-bikes are sold for daily commuters, especially in a
hilly city like San Francisco. Zip to work and back with no car, faster than public transport.
You can get some very good e-bikes these days. Millions of them are sold and used in China, and
there are also very good models from Europe.

But I am looking for a touring e-bike, one that could give me mild assistance over 80 miles. I am
doing a 1,000-mile tour with my teenage son and his cousin, and I can't keep up with them,
particularly on the hills. So I need a very mild assist to "flatten the hills" yet lightweight
enough that for the rest of the time while I am pedaling, the bike with motor is not a burden.

Eric Hicks, the expert at ElectricBike.com recommended I try out a German Stromer e-bike. The
legendary bike rental store Blazing Saddles rents e-bikes to tourists near the Golden Gate
Bridge, so I headed there last weekend. The Stromer uses a motor on the back wheel, called a hub
motor, and retains some of the chain derailer shifting. When the motor is off you can pedal as
normal (the motor doesn't impede your pedaling), and you pedal even while the motor is running
-- thus it is called Pedal Assist. You can set the amount of assist you want, from very low to very
strong. The motor will only assist when you pedal. So it is not a lightweight motorcycle, but a
pedal assist bicycle. A downside of the a hub motor is that changing a flat is a huge project.

So on Saturday I rode the Stromer with my son on 30-mile roundtrip across the Golden Gate Bridge
into Marin. I was able to keep up with him (he's on a fast road bike), but only by using the assist
on most hills, more than I thought I would. I can handle most hills on a road bike myself, so I was
only looking for assist on the steepest hills. But the e-bike is so heavy with motor and battery
and the gears do not go low enough so that I had to use the lowest help for any hill. Catch-22. I
could only go non-assist on the flats and downhills. But we did 30 miles and I had 3/4 of the
charge left, so it is possible I could get twice that mileage out of it using it as I did, only in
the lowest setting.



Image: http://www.kk.org/cooltools/FO11_E-Bike_Jarifa_Speed_01_307db8f0d0.jpeg

Also on Friday I test rode the Focus e-bike from New Wheels in Bernal Heights, San Francisco.
The Focus Speed is from Europe and uses a Panasonic mid-drive. Rather than turn the back (or
front wheel), it turns the chain from a place near the crankshaft (mid-point). The Focus has a
mighty 18-amp battery, and in low "eco" mode, and with a smaller drive sprocket, New Wheels
believe I can get 80 miles from it. I did not find it noisy, a complaint of some other mid-drives.
Like the Stromer, it is too heavy and high geared to pedal up any kind of hills without assist,
especially if loaded with touring gear. I preferred it to the Stromer because the controls
were nicer, battery bigger, and the mid-drive would be less complicated to fix a flat tire.

I tried out one other e-bike, a recumbent, and today I hope to try another. I'll report here on
which, if any, I buy. But whatever one I go for, it's a bike for touring, with only mild assist. If
I were buying one just for commuting, I might choose another.

If you know a lot about bikes, or have one to recommend as fantastic, please rave about it in the
comments, or send us a review.
