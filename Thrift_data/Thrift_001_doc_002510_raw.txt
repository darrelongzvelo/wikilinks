What’s new in ICS 4.0.4?

  android , photos , review   No Responses » Jul 13 2012

 

Downloaded the ICS 4.0.4 via OTA today. I had gotten a prompt on my phone yesterday afternoon.
It was about 100MB. OTA updates is usually very easy. Just need to click OK and usually it will
run without any problems. In less than 30 minutes after downloading and starting the update
process, my Samsung Galaxy Note is now running the fairly new version of Android — Ice Cream
Sandwich 4.0.4. Let’s not talk about Jelly Bean (Android version 4.1).

So, what is new?

OTA – ICS 4.0.4 for Galaxy Note

  quickie   1 Response » Jul 12 2012

 

Just got a prompt for firmware update on my Samsung Galaxy Note . Looks like I’ll be getting
Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 (ICS 4.0.4) soon…

OTA too! No need to use that really ridiculous Samsung Kies .   Posted by atai at 19:17   Tagged

Apex launcher

  android , gadget , photos , review   2 Responses » Jun 04 2012

 

From Wikipedia :

A launcher presents the main view of the phone and is responsible for starting other apps and
hosting live widgets.

Launcher provides the OS with a certain look and feel. TouchWiz (by Samsung) and HTCSense (by
HTC) are launchers as well.

Last week, I tried out Nova Launcher on my Samsung Galaxy Note running ICS4.x . Nova Launcher
seems quite good but the gesture features are only found in the premium (paid version) called
Nova Prime.

This evening, I tried out another similar launcher — Apex Launcher . Like Nova Launcher,
there is also a premium version. But gesture support is available on the free version of Apex
Launcher. So, how is Apex Launcher? Continue reading »   Posted by atai at 22:17   Tagged

Ice Cream Sandwich — A Galactic Noteworthy dessert?

  android , gadget , photos , review   3 Responses » May 30 2012

 

In case you’re wondering… Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) is the nickname for the Android 4.x
Operating System (OS) by Google .

OVERVIEW

I have been holding back my review of the Samsung Galaxy Note because I felt that my review would
not do justice to the phone. I felt that at the time the Galaxy Note was released, it really felt
like a half-baked effort from Samsung — just make the phone bigger (than the Samsung Galaxy
S2 ), modify the software a bit and call it the Galaxy Note. Yes, that was how I felt about the
software — half-baked and disjointed at times.

SIZE MATTERS…

The hardware itself… With a 5.3″ screen, you either love or hate the size. Some (like me)
would love the screen size. Pocket-able yet browsing the internet and watching movie does not
strain the eyes. Everything is big, clear & vibrant! But there are others who would be turned
off by the size. And the S-Pen (a stylus)… I feel it really does make a positive difference.
Scribbling and drawing is whole lot easier and fun! And then there’s the battery — even
with my heavy usage, the Galaxy Note can last about 12 hours! That is really good.

My Samsung Galaxy Note recently had its software and OS updated… So, does it still feel like a
half-baked effort by Samsung? Continue reading »   Posted by atai at 13:17   Tagged with:

Draw Something

  android , photos , review   1 Response » Mar 13 2012

 

OK, I’ve been bitten by the ‘ Draw Something ‘ bug. It’s currently the IN thing and the
developer even has this line in their description at Google Play (formerly Android Market):

***The #1 Word Game in US, Australia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Malaysia , and Singapore***



Image: http://adriantai.com/2011/wp-content/uploads/draw_something_01.jpg

It’s really addictive and hilarious (especially when you play with someone who sucks at
drawing).

In this game, each player takes turn to draw out the word they have chosen (you have three
options) and the other player would have to guess what the word is. Yes, it’s that simple.

One can actually get a good laugh looking at some of the ‘masterpieces’. Here are two of
them (mouse over the image to find out the word being drawn):

But sometimes, the words given can be really ‘tricky. I mean… How do we draw BEYONCE ?



Image: http://adriantai.com/2011/wp-content/uploads/draw_something_04.jpg

OK. I’m no artist. I got an earful from my friend when I drew these for him:

Image: http://adriantai.com/2011/wp-content/uploads/draw_something_05.jpg

Image: http://adriantai.com/2011/wp-content/uploads/draw_something_06.jpg

I was trying to draw the word AUTOBOTS .

The first picture shows the emblem of Decepticons and Autobots . The second picture is
supposed to be Bumblebee (cartoon version) transforming into a robot.

Oh ya… Beyonce. I think I got it figured out. Click ‘Continue reading’ to see what I
drew… Continue reading »   Posted by atai at 20:17   Tagged with: android , apps
