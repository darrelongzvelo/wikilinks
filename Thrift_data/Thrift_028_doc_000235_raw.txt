Wack Pack



The Wack Pack is the name given to a wide assortment of regular guests of The Howard Stern Show .
As a parody of the Rat Pack or Brat Pack , they were often as memorable as Stern’s regular
airtime celebrity guests. Wack Packers tend to be unusual in some way, such as blatantly
racist , mentally disabled , sexually deviant or having a comical voice or appearance. Not
every regular guest is considered a member of The Wack Pack, nor are staff members like Robin
Quivers , Fred Norris , Gary Dell’Abate , Artie Lange , Benjy Bronk , or the now-departed
Stuttering John .

Some Wack Packers appear to serve as cautionary figures; for example, Crackhead Bob , who
suffered a debilitating stroke from smoking crack cocaine , or Joe Cancer , who smoked tobacco
. Jeff the Drunk and the deceased Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf suggest moderation . Wack
Packers are often pariahs or outcasts from mainstream society, with difficulty finding jobs
or mates. Stern alternatingly revels in, sympathizes with and ridicules the loneliness and
desperation of their lives.

Through their appearances on Stern’s radio program and the now defunct E! television show ,
some Wack Packers have gained notoriety for personal appearances around the country and
occasionally, have gotten small roles in movies and television . Castmember Artie Lange has
referred to them as “G-List Celebrities,” based on their modest level of social and media
popularity.

On October 20 , 2005 , Stern announced plans for the Wack Pack to elect their own “ Pope ” from
their ranks. In addition to the honor of leading the Wack Pack, the winner would receive a US$
10,000 prize. This bit appears to have been abandoned as it has not been mentioned on-air since
Stern’s Sirius Radio debut. Though it seems Stern exploits them wantonly, Wack Packers are
well-respected (yet mocked like most Stern regulars) and are fiercely protected by show
staff and fans alike. During the December 16 , 2005 terrestrial finale webcast on Yahoo! , one
of the hosts remarked that Yahoo! had received instructions for Wack Pack to be treated
“better than celebrities.”

On June 19 , 2006, Howard Stern announced a contest for the next Wack Packer, with the winner
receiving $5000. The winner was Bigfoot (Mark) .

Current members





[ edit ] Angry Black



Angry Black is a black man who attended the Connecticut School of Broadcasting and works for a
telephone company. Angry Black is an avid New York Giants fan, and once fought Crazy Cabbie in a
five-round boxing match which ended in a draw. He recently scammed his way into the audience
during the roast of Daniel Carver , earning the ire of Stern and crew. Angry is an avid boxing and
New York Yankees fan. When asked why he’s so angry, he stated: “I would rather be feared
than loved because fear lasts longer.”



[ edit ] Ass Napkin Ed



Ass Napkin Ed , A caller from Buffalo who asked Howard for help with his hygiene problems. After
a few minutes of conversation we learned that Ed lodged a napkin between his cheeks to keep from
staining his underwear. His insanity made everyone on the show laugh and he was called to make
an appearance shortly after his call. [1]



[ edit ] Beetlejuice (Lester Green)

    

        Main article: Beetlejuice (entertainer)

    



Beetlejuice is a mentally challenged microcephalic dwarf . He is known to make outrageous
claims (i.e., that he is 6Â ftÂ 7Â in (2.01Â m) in height) which are rarely
consistent. In a 2006 show, Green admitted to taking Paxil and smoking pot to alleviate
depression.



[ edit ] Big Black



Often labeled a black nerd , Big Black was a regular on The Howard Stern Show until being evicted
from his apartment. Black worked as representative for NYNEX . He used his position at NYNEX to
learn of WXRK radio’s “inside” lines, which he called constantly, until discovered by
Howard.

On June 28 , 2006, Howard officially dubbed Big Black a Wack Packer, although Black’s
appearances are rare.



[ edit ] Bigfoot



Hailing from Newport, Vermont , Bigfoot (Mark Shaw) is the winner of the “Pick the Newest
Wack Packer” contest held August 3 , 2006 (the first Wack Packer to receive entry to the group
by contest). Stern once suggested that Bigfoot’s nickname be changed to “ Sasquatch ”
(or other name) to avoid confusion with the deceased Matthew McGrory, an earlier Wack Packer
who had the “Bigfoot” moniker .

The deep-voiced Bigfoot is 6Â ftÂ 4Â in (1.93Â m) tall and has size 14EEE feet. He
claims to be a schizophrenic suffering from sleep apnea and multiple personality disorder ,
and claims to be a former lighter fluid sniffer with a lengthy criminal record, including an
18-month jail term for breaking and entering . In an April 11, 2008 interview with Howard 100
News, his mother said “he is retarded, though he doesn’t like to admit it.” He tends to
finish many of his sentences with, “it is” (for example, “My nickname is Bigfoot, it
is.”), and never with any apparent reason or regard to proper conjugation.

It was alleged on February 5, 2007 that his girlfriend Lori, with whom he had been living since
recently winning $8,333.33 in Stern’s annual football pool, had kicked him out of her
house, claiming not only that he falsely accused her and her daughter of having an incestuous
relationship, but that he threatened to overdose in her home. Bigfoot claims to have ingested
â€œ14 trays, it isâ€� of pills due to distress over the breakup, adding that he would
find happiness even if it meant “he had to move to fâ€™ Africa…it is.â€� After a
telephone spat with Lori on the February 6, 2007, show, Bigfoot admitted that life was much
simpler when he blew guys instead of dating girls.

On March 11, 2007 at the “Killers of Comedy” show at Higher Ground in Burlington, Vermont ,
Bigfoot was a special guest. During the show, Shuli and Bob Levy were searching for a girl to
have him eat blue cheese dressing off of her stomach. Instead, Bob suggested a hefty fan from
the audience named Tom to come on stage. Bigfoot was reluctant at first, but then Shuli offered
him $100 to do it, and he accepted. Currently, a video of the event can be seen on Shuli’s
Myspace webpage.

According to a July 20, 2007 Howard 100 News report, Bigfoot attempted suicide and was in
intensive care. On September 17, 2007 Bigfoot won a contest to star in a porno film opposite
Tabitha Stevens .



[ edit ] Blue Iris



A 68-year-old woman from Burbank, California , Blue Iris performs in “granny porn “, and
guest-hosted the Howard 100 program Tissue Time with Heidi Cortez . She rode the Sybian on
April 6 , 2006 , and sidelines as a stand-up comic who performs weekly with her comedy troupe
‘The Ding Dong Show’. She reportedly had shock therapy in her 20s which she blames for her
many ailments. Iris’s popular catch phrases (used during Stern Show prank phone calls)
include “I love a black cock”, “Can I put my finger in your ass?”, “This is better
than rejuvenation”,”I’m getting myself hot!” and “Hurry up sonny, I’ve got a
hot shit in the chamber!”

Her first Stern Show appearance occurred on February 4 , 2004 , but was not until Stern’s show
went to Sirius Satellite Radio in 2006 when Iris finally gained Wack Packer status. On October
18 , 2006 , Artie Lange engaged in a ten second French kiss on-camera with Blue Iris, to settle a
bet made with pro wrestler Chris Kanyon when the New York Yankees failed to advance past the New
York Mets in the 2006 Major League Baseball playoffs . On January 30, 2007 “ Howard 100 News
” (on Howard Stern Sirius channel 100) reported that Iris was hospitalized after suffering
a stroke. On January 31, 2007 she called Stern’s show to explain that she was experiencing
weakness on her left side, as well as impaired verbal and math skills. She recently had a 7 pound
tumor removed from one of her ovaries.

Captain Janks is known for prank calling publicly aired radio and television programs,
especially in times of crisis.



[ edit ] Crackhead Bob



Crackhead Bob is a recovering crack cocaine addict whose right side was paralyzed by crack
cocaine-induced strokes . He named himself “Bob” as he was unable to pronounce his real
name “George” due to his paralysis. In the summer of 2001 Bob retired from The Howard Stern
Show and went on to make anti-drug commercials. He revisited the show on October 18 , 2005 after
a four year absence and attended Stern’s last day on terrestrial radio on December 16 , 2005 .

Bob reemerged on Howard’s Sirius show in 2006. The clarity of his speech and phrasing has
improved noticeably since reducing his use of marijuana . He claims that the money he received
from The Howard Stern Show appearances and promotions contributed to his addiction . Along
with Jon Hein and Will Murray , he provided the color commentary for the “ Stupid Bowl ”
which first aired half time during Super Bowl XLI on Howard TV .

On the October 8 , 2007 Howard Stern Show, Bob stated he was moving to Texas for financial
reasons, and will no longer be appearing in person on the show. He said he would still
participate as a caller from time to time.



[ edit ] Crazy Alice (a.k.a Angry Alice)



Originally hailing from Alabama , Crazy Alice claims to be half African-American and half
Italian (with the surname Gotti ), who freely admits to hating black people . Alice was
discovered when she called the show from her California home, after which she flew to New York
to appear live in Stern’s studio on December 9 , 1999 . She is best known for filibustering
during arguments (as heard in the Touch-Tone Terrorists , particularly with “Junkyard
Willie”), having wild mood swings , and engaging in long screaming rants when called
“Crazy Alice”. During her long-winded rants, it is common for Stern to turn down the send
(audio) from his microphone to the phone patch, while the crew discusses her lunacy or wagers
on the duration of a given rant. On May 4 , 2006 she expressed a preference for the moniker
“Angry Alice”, as she blames domestic abuse for her temper and erratic behavior. She
often refers to Howard as “Gay Howard” in retaliation to being called crazy. The “Who
dis?” soundbite, commonly used throughout the show, was spoken by Crazy Alice.

Since the move to Sirius Alice has had a tremendously disdainful relationship with Artie
which came to a head on June 15th, 2006, when the two engaged in an on-air feud which lasted for
approximately twenty-five minutes, and was spurned during a quasi-apology that she tried to
deliver to show announcer, George Takei .

About six minutes into her phone-call, Artie started a Star Trek -themed
Crazy-Alice-rant-impersonation, which quickly spiraled into a lengthy squabble dubbed by
meticulous show archiver, Mark Mercer, “Crazy Alice vs. Crazy Artie”. This argument
lasted at least 15 minutes. [2] The two have since buried the hatchet and when Alice came to
visit the studio in late 2007, the two patched things up in-person, after which Artie took her
for a shopping trip to the official Yankees Store.

On April 10, 2008, Artie abruptly departed the show after an angry physical altercation with
his assistant, Teddy, saying “Howard, I resign!” which Stern then accepted. During the
following week, which was a vacation for the staff featuring specials opposed to new
programming, Alice left an emotional voicemail for Howard 100 News reporter, Shuli ,
throughout which she (somewhat uncharacteristically) was crying, saying to make sure
“that Artie knows Alice loves him.” Artie returned with the rest of the cast once the
vacation ended and regular programming resumed where the voicemail was played again on the
air.

Her latest feud is with Howard News reporter, Steve Langford.



[ edit ] Daniel Carver

    

        Main article: Daniel Carver

    



Daniel Carver is a Klan leader and Wack Pack member since the 1980s. He has often been the target
of Stern crew prank calls, and was roasted in one of the Stern’s Sirius shows by comics from
the gay, lesbian, black, Hispanic and Jewish communities. The roast was regarded as a dud as
Carver simply used offensive epithets before dismissing each comedian with a wave of his
hand.



[ edit ] Dan the Farter



Dan the Farter is a flatulist capable of passing gas on command. First appearance: 9/29/1998.



[ edit ] Debbie the Queef(er)



Debbie the Queef(er) is capable of passing vaginal air on command. She was on the air the very
first day Howard 100 broadcast.



[ edit ] Double A



Double A’ s name is derived from one of his favorite wrestlers Arn Anderson who used to be
called “Double A”, the two A’s stand for Awesome Angelo . He is best known for his
obsession with all things Stern, his intense “crush” on Stern’s fianceÃ© Beth
Ostrosky , and his love of professional wrestling (often wearing replica wrestling belts).

Double A sports multiple Stern-related tattoos including one of Stern’s face and another
of the Howard 100 “fist” logo. His phone calls to the show invariably begin with the phrase
“Hey Howard, how’s it goin’, what’s goin’ on?” in a strong, nasal New Jersey
accent. He claims that his family won a large sum of money in a lottery , enabling him to invest in
real estate and retire early. In 2006, he “revealed” that, at the young age of 12, he had
sexual intercourse with a friend’s mother.

Double A’s behavior was a subject of controversy at The Howard Stern Film Festival . He
allegedly tried to extort extra tickets from Howard Stern On Demand producer Doug Goodstein
beforehand. Later, he was apparently caught on video sneaking a girl into the “after
party” and then leaving the affair with a few gift bags, which Double A categorically
denies. Irish John, Angry Black, and Bobo support Double A’s version of the events, while
Zolar and Joey Boots insist that he is lying.

Double A most recently used irrelevant association with the Howard Stern Show to get dinner
reservations at New York City’s Nobu restaurant. When calling he was told there were no
tables available for his party. He then said “This is Double A from The Howard Stern Show”
(a title he gave himself), the hostess pushed him ahead on the list. Nobu’s manager Richie
Notar was annoyed by this and informed Howard 100 News.

On September 20th 2007, Double A bad-mouthed Playboy’s Haydn Porter during a call-in
segment when Haydn accused Double A of stalking her and inviting her over to “watch
Goodfellas and cuddle.”

On November 15, 2007, Double A was on Stern and he claimed to have a tape of he and Haydn Porter
having phone sex. In an ironic turn of events, Double A claimed he had too much class to play it on
the air. In a quick interview after the show, he raised concern of Porter possibly being
underage and wanting to burn the tape.



[ edit ] Elephant Boy



Elephant Boy (real name Fred Schreiber) is best known for his severe speech impediment and his
on-air tales of sexual experimentation. He works as an accountant in New York City, but
originally hails from Cleveland . Elephant Boy was referred to the Stern show in 1988 by a
coworker and Stern fan who thought Fred’s speech impediment would be show-worthy.

Elephant Boy once called a dateline to solicit couples for swinging , with the stipulation
that the male partner be bisexual or bi-curious but only succeeded in humiliating himself
once a Stern fan alerted the show about the dateline voice message.



[ edit ] Elliot Offen



“Elegant” Elliot Offen is a flamboyant crossdresser who speaks in his own gangster
slang. He often appears on the show yelling about his “healthy lifestyle”, which
consists of eating only raw fruits and vegetables and running 20 miles a day in women’s
lingerie . Because he wears women’s clothing, many believe that Offen is a homosexual. To
disclaim these allegations, Offen visited the show with hired actresses pretending to be his
girlfriend, and often rants that he is heterosexual (Stern discovered that Offen had hired a
woman to pose as his girlfriend when he asked them to kiss). Since the show’s move to Sirius,
Offen has only been interviewed from the street outside the Sirius building, as security
wouldn’t permit him entrance. He hasn’t appeared on the show since mid-2006.

Offen was known as a con man long before his first appearance on the Stern show. In 1988, Offen
was arrested in New York City for fraud . He recently starred in a degradation video with a
dominatrix , and is known to have a large penis. Oddly enough, he went through a period where he
used the word “right” to punctuate his sentences, in a manner similar to 1920s-era
mobsters. He also has a penchant for mispronouncing large words, perhaps deliberately, or
using them in nonsensical ways. He often shows a preference for technical scientific or
medical terms, often using them in bizarre or incorrect ways. He shows a preference towards
alliteration , often in a way similar to what psychologists call ‘ clanging ‘.

He is known for rewording his sentences into what he calls “gangster talk”, ending
sentences with the word “RIGHT???”, and in his October 2006 fallout with the show,
started using a “ maniacal laugh .”

Offen also occasionally alludes to an alleged attempted robbery in Queens where he claims he
was accosted by three individuals who demanded money. According to Offen, he “had the guy
who was six-foot-six around his trachea , cutting off his air supply”. [3] It is not known or
discussed by Offen what happened to the remaining two perpetrators and why they did not react
to his act of self-defense.



[ edit ] Eric the Midget

    

        Main article: Eric the Midget

    



Eric the Midget is a dwarf born with a medical condition that confines him to a wheelchair. He
insists that he not be called a midget , preferring to be called Eric the Actor . He is known for
his devotion to American Idol and professional wrestling as well as his distinct voice. Eric
is considered extremely ungrateful by Stern fans and staff for only hesitantly expressing
gratitude at any favors he receives from Stern Show staff despite the fact that he has had
acting opportunities and met celebrities due to his connection with the Stern Show . Eric’s
Stern Show claim to fame also results from accepting and declining invitations to become
levitated with balloons.

On June 27, 2007, Eric vowed to never call into the show ever again after; according to Eric,
Howard disrespected Chris Benoit and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The alleged
disrespect came from Howard’s discussion of the fact that Benoit killed his family and
himself. Because of Eric’s obsession with the WWE, he took any negative comments about the
Benoit murders personally.

Eric also has obsessed about American Idol contestants like Diana DeGarmo , Kelly Clarkson
and Katharine McPhee . Howard, along with his staff and fans believe Eric won’t live up to
this and will be calling in to future shows. He did, in fact, call in again on September 11, 2007,
and again the next day for a full hour claiming that he “wasn’t calling into the show.”
Eric has since been a regular caller to the show and still does not understand why Howard
doesn’t put him on the air immediately. Eric has complained about the recent reports of his
death. On February 25, 2008, Eric claimed that he would stop calling into the Stern Show . The
very next day, he called back into the show and again claimed he was done with the show. That
night, he held a press conference to explain his reasons for being done with the show.



[ edit ] Evil Dave Letterman

    

        Main article: Evil Dave Letterman

    



Known on the show as either Evil Dave Letterman or Evil Dave , he is a frequent guest on The Howard
Stern Show who is able to very accurately imitate the voice of late night show host David
Letterman . Due to his strikingly accurate impersonation, Evil Dave is sometimes able to
confuse people into thinking he is the real Letterman, and has duped several people over the
phone (e.g. George Takei and Riley Martin ). While portraying the real Letterman, Evil Dave
typically makes politically incorrect comments that the real Letterman would not say, which
are often along the lines of being anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic,
paedophilia-inspired, sexually suggestive, homosexual, or autoerotic. While delivering
lines, Evil Dave has a tendency to mispronounce words and names, ruining the punch line of many
jokes.

Evil Dave is also known to improvise with his own material despite being warned repeatedly
(and sometimes physically restrained) from doing so. While he is generally a “hit” early
in the broadcast, he tends to “wear out his welcome” near the end, although this effect is
typically well received by the cast members.

In addition to his Letterman impersonation, Evil Dave is also known for his tendency to be
easily duped by Stern Show staff, often being persuaded into performing ridiculous tasks,
such as bogus public service announcements and unnecessary apologies for people suffering
from illness.

Evil Dave is often the subject of intelligence-related tests that highlight his below
average level of intelligence or inability to pronounce words and names. Evil Dave describes
his own physical appearance as similar to fellow albino Edgar Winter .



[ edit ] Gary the Retard



Gary The Retard is a mentally challenged frequent guest of The Howard Stern Show . His thick
glasses, cheerful attitude and toothless grin make him a favorite among Stern show
listeners. He is frequently antagonized by Artie Lange, who often merely has to say
“Retard!” to elicit an angry tirade from Gary. On August 12 , 1998 he was scheduled to
appear on the show but got lost at the airport. A listener who worked at the airport eventually
found him and called the show. In 2003, Gary was a member of the show’s weekly football pool
along with Daniel Carver, Gary Dell’Abate’s son Jackson, and a chicken named Sanders.
Gary the Retard picked the Seattle Seahawks to win every week. They seem to be the only NFL team
he knows. He lives in Albany, Oregon and works at Burgerville, USA . Gary recently claimed to
have a girlfriend who was just released from incarceration. It has been indicated that the
woman has been taking advantage of his handicap to get money and access to the show. According
to employees at the local Radio Shack , Gary is a CB radio and scanner enthusiast. [ original
research? ]

Early in 2005, staff member Sal “the Stockbroker” Governale, pulled a prank phone call on
Gary, using an assumed name and informing him that a flu was in his phone line, coming to “get
him” and that he would have to repeat the phrase “Shoo, shoo, no retarded flu!” in order
to keep it away. In doing this, the flu would be weakened. Gary was warned to be careful though
and tried to disguise his voice. Since then, the “retarded flu” prank has been pulled on
Gary numerous times, including at live appearances, and he always falls for it, chanting
“Shoo, shoo, retarded flu!”.



[ edit ] Gay Ramon(e)



Gay Ramon(e) is a frequent caller and guest of The Howard Stern Show . He often talks about his
homosexual experiences and has participated on the show in various games in which straight
men must do gay things in order to win prizes.



[ edit ] Hanzi



Hanzi is a weed smoking young man with Pakistani descent. He is unemployed and smokes a lot of
weed. He is currently living off of money he gets from his Engineer father. He writes journals
that center on his depression and neurotic tendencies.



[ edit ] Hate Man



Hate Man is a caller who leaves strange racist messages, screaming “I love you monkey,
monkey, monkey!” in reference to Robin Quivers. He was heard previously on terrestrial
radio and was heard on the Sirius show for the first time on June 7 , 2006 .

Hate Man has recently reappeared on Stern’s Sirius show with his “monkey monkey
monkey” tirades against Robin Quivers and perhaps moving towards an eventual in-studio
appearance, although no one associated with the show had ever (knowingly) met him. Very
little is known about him; in one voice mail he alluded to the possibility that he was or had been
an NYPD officer.

Hate Man however, is usually considered a caller, and not a wack packer.



[ edit ] High Pitch Eric



High Pitch Eric , is known for his trademark falsetto speaking voice and for his obesity , poor
hygiene, willingness to submit to degrading acts just to please Howard Stern, and failure to
return owed money and favors. He has used notoriety garnered from multiple appearances on The
Howard Stern Show to shamelessly ask for free money, services, event tickets and favors. He
first appeared on the Stern Show on 8/15/1997, where he was brought in off the street into the
studio because of his unusually high voice and “superfan” demeanor. High Pitch was
recently confronted on the air by several businessmen he had scammed by writing bad checks for
various services, such as limousine rides, a fully catered holiday dinner for his family, and
an industrial coffee machine installed in his apartment. High Pitch Eric also has an
unnatural fear of fish , and flees in terror whenever the show staff bring fish near him. He also
has tried unsuccessfully to imitate other people such as Gary Dell’Abate and even Kelly
Clarkson. This lead to his much played sound drop, “Who’s High Pitch?” in response to
his intended phone prank victim recognizing his voice to be High Pitch Eric, and not Kelly
Clarkson. He has, however, somewhat successfully fooled people into believing he was former
show staffer KC Armstrong . As “KC” he created another much used sound drop of him saying,
“Nice!” in the manner that KC would use it to emphasize something nasty or inappropriate.

He suffers from Gout , possibly due to his ever-increasing weight and bad dietary habits.

On September 7, 2007 it was mentioned by the Howard 100 News Team on Sirius Radio that Eric is
also facing eviction for not paying his rent for over 8 months. He was evicted on August 2, 2007.

According to the Howard 100 News Team on Sirius Radio, Eric is currently working as a laborer
for a construction company on Long Island . He was hired in late August 2007 as a laborer, but
fired after two weeks due to the length of time it took him to paint a door. In recent months
charges were filed against HPE for making threatening phones calls to a girl. She would later
drop the charges.



[ edit ] Irish John



Irish John is a regular caller to the show who works selling and renting construction
equipment in the Bronx. He hangs out with the likes of High Pitch Eric, Angry Black, Double A,
Eddie the Produce Guy. Irish John was allegedly kicked out of 2 Amsterjam concerts for
drunkingly demanding VIP status, which Irish John denies. Irish John and Joey Boots have had
an ongoing feud because of Joey’s accusations that he is trying to buy his way on to the show.
This feud escalated during the High Pitch Erik Craptacular and almost came to blows. His
brother was featured on the show because he dated and slept with former porn star Tabitha
Stevens. Irish John was also called by Howard TV to take part in their first national
commercial filmed in Bloomfield, New Jersey in early April, and is set to premiere in late
April. Also featured in the commercial are Nicole Bass, Siobhan, Double A, High Pitch Erik,
and Eddie the Produce Guy. Irish John called in during a bit where Joey Boots claimed in yet
another revelation that he was gay. Irish John claimed Joey was just an attention whore
looking for a new angle to get on the show. After High Pitch Erik was evicted, Irish John invited
High Pitch to live with him along with his dog. Irish John told Howard that the tenants in his
building were complaining about the dog, and that he would keep them there out of spite. When
asked about how it is living with High Pitch Erik, Irish John said he was pretty neat, but
because of the frequent usage of the air conditioning, he equated it to living with Mr. Freeze.
Artie told Irish John that the colder his place is, the better, this way whatever was festering
on High Pitch Erik would not be able to come to life. On September 12th, Irish John competed in a
segment to win a date with the exwife of Jackie “The Jokeman” Martling, along with 2 other
contestants. The date went to a listener to the show Paulie, who is also known for his
threatening on air calls to former mobster-turned-artist Henry Hill of Goodfellas fame.



[ edit ] Jeff the Drunk (Jeff Curro)



Jeff The Drunk , is an alcoholic with a paralyzed arm, who frequently gets into trouble because
of his alcohol and drug problems. His paralyzed arm is the result of an injury suffered in a
drunk driving accident. In 2007, he underwent several surgeries to remove a large ulcer and
graft skin on his buttocks. Jeff lives in a trailer in East Berne, New York with his brother
(since the death of his mother). He is known for drunken rants featuring the epithet “little
bitch” and the catch-phrase “ni-i-ice.”

Jeff Curro attended and graduated from Berne-Knox-Westerlo Central School District in

[ edit ] Jeff the Vomit Guy (Jeff Levy)



Jeff the Vomit Guy has appeared on the The Howard Stern Show to meet women interested in
emetophilia (vomit fetish). Due to the difficulty of finding willing participants for the
fetish, Levy usually resorts to paying prostitutes to vomit on him. On the show, a number of
guests and show members have vomited on him, a practice known as a “ Roman Shower “. Jeff has
been vomited on by the following people on air: Glen Zolar’s girlfriend Tara (12/11/2000),
a transvestite named Danny (8/2/2001), porn star Kendra Jade (9/6/2001), a woman named
Jessica (3/2/2004), a girl competing for breast implants named Leighann (5/18/2005), a
woman named Jasmine competing for a trip to the AVN Awards and later Richard Christy
(11/17/2005), and most recently porn star Paris Gables and later Richard Christy
(5/24/2006). Levy insists that he is strictly heterosexual and is only aroused by women’s
vomit. Levy seems to feel this practice is normal , and that people who do not enjoy this fetish
are abnormal . He is a former garbage man and postal worker who receives Supplemental Security
Income (SSI). Levy has been a guest on the Jerry Springer Show and was featured in Hustler
magazine.

It was revealed on September 17, 2007 that he has a very odd looking penis during a contest in
which the winner would be in an oral sex scene with Tabitha Stevens. Despite not being willing
to vomit on Levy, Tabitha Stevens entertained his fantasy by spitting on him multiple times.



[ edit ] Joey Boots



Joey Boots was a long-time regular caller, Joey also used to be regular on the Super Fan Round
Table that airs at 7:00pm Eastern on Thursdays on Howard 101 on Sirius Satellite Radio, until
he was asked to stop showing up. According to show producers Joey’s presence on the round
table has been causing issues and new views are needed. Joey once participated in a stunt where
he had “Icy Hot” applied to his small testicles.

He has admitted to having problems with drugs and alcohol and once announced on the Stern Show
that he was entering into rehab. He then relapsed, snorting coke on webcam and embarrassing
himself, the owner of Sinus Buster who employed him, and the late Leslie Armstrong (“Meet
the Shrink”).

Prior to entering rehab, Joey revealed on 2/15/2006 that he once had been anally raped when he
was 15 years old. This revelation was to be a part of the “Wack Pack Revelations,” but Joey
had to make his revelation early due to his entering rehab. Boots also once admitted on the show
that he used to pretend to be a gay hustler, and then rob his “Johns” but claims that he never
actually engaged in any sexual activities with the Johns, he only robbed them and gave oral
with a condom. On Thursday, June 28, 2007, Joey came on the show to make another revelation. The
staff speculated on what he was going to say. Howard and Fred thought Boots was going to admit
that he was gay. Artie guessed that Joey had HIV . Robin guessed that Boots was going to have a sex
change operation. Shuli guessed it was either something gay, or that he’d been “born
again.” Boots said that he hoped getting the revelation off his chest would help him with his
recovery process. Boots revealed that he was gay, and said that he’d been going out to gay
clubs “on the sly” to get oral sex. Boots said he wasn’t bisexual but since he slept with
fat, ugly, old women he must be about “80/20.” He also has had sex with his own father.

On Thursday, September 6th, 2007 Joey attempted to prove to the skeptics that he was indeed gay
by making out with a gay male porn star on the Howard Stern Show, the stunt was not well accepted.



[ edit ] John the Stutterer



John the Stutterer (not to be confused with Stuttering John Melendez ) first appeared on the
Howard Stern Radio Show as a “Dating Game” contestant with the Dahm Triplets . He won the
contest and, due to his severe nervous stuttering , is considered an official Wack Packer.
John is unemployed and relies on SSI. He lives in the Rittenhouse Square region of
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania .

John has had several on-air fights with Yucko the Clown , who has repeatedly called John a
“stuttering prick,” while John often accuses Yucko of being a child molester . Recently,
John called Yucko a Robin Williams look-a-like. Stern often asks John to act as a judge for
various on-air contests. Like ‘Wack Packer’ Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf, John is very
good at classic rock trivia.

Sound effects man Fred Norris often tries to exacerbate John’s stuttering by doing a
stammering impression as John speaks. Some have accused John of faking his stutter, either
for the publicity or malingering . He can speak clearly on some occasions, especially when
angry. Norris will frequently call attention to instances where John loses his stutter.

John claims to suffer from psychological problems including obsessive compulsive disorder
and depression . Some Stern Show staff have suggested that the stuttering may be a side-effect
of drug use. John has refused offers of free professional treatment, arguing that without the
speech impediment, he would have no excuse for his failures in life. John has appeared in a few
low-budget porno films , but on August 16 , 2006 , John declared himself “retired” from the
industry after being embarrassed on-air by “G-Spot”, a former porn co-star.

On March 8th , 2007 he defeated Howard TV director Scott Depace in a political debate dubbed the
“Not So Great Debate” by 3-1 margin as voted by the listeners. Although he won, he was
ridiculed by the staff for talking too long and not getting to the point quick enough.

Debuting on July 30th , 2007 , John got his own show on Howard 101, discussing various political
topics. Surprisingly Howard and the staff were impressed with the show, and Tim Saeban said it
will go on for another episode.

On May 14 , 2008 , John made a fully nude appearance in the Howard Stern studio and propositioned
that he and porn star Tabitha Stevens engage in various sexual acts. He concluded his
appearance by exposing his entire asshole to Stevens and the Howard TV cameras. During the
anal exposure, a large white hemorrhoid was revealed, to which John attributed to his
excessive wiping technique after defecating.

[ edit ] King of All Blacks



King of All Blacks is an Englewood, New Jersey garbage man , and a frequent Stern caller. He
claims to be the only black home-owner in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. He currently
is involved in a lawsuit against his employer, the local sanitation department, claiming he
was sexually harassed by his female supervisor, leading to his demotion from the position of
street sweeper. His many years of work in the sanitation industry has given him the uncanny
ability to identify peoples’ race or ethnicity based upon the trash they discard, a skill at
which he proved adept when Howard put him to an on-air test. He is known for his knowledge of
fancy lifestyles and criticizes other blacks for having poor style and taste. He was born into
a wealthy family, and admits that he looks down on people with less money. He is known for
mentioning brand names of expensive items he owns, especially Moen faucets, wearing a fur
coat, and having cosmetic surgery to improve his appearance. Recently, he had his own show on
Sirius Howard 100 (Sirius Satellite Radio) but was quickly canceled. First appearance:
12/2/1993.



[ edit ] Mark the Bagger



Mark the Bagger is grocery bagger from Collegeville, Pennsylvania , who works at the local
ACME supermarket and is a newer member of the Wack Pack. Mark is best known for his high-pitched
voice. (In a prank call often played in early 2006, Mark tells High Pitch Eric that he is the new
High Pitch Eric, which set off an ongoing feud between them). He probably has below-average
intelligence but denies being mentally retarded. He claims to be bisexual , having engaged in
sexual relations with a single man and a single woman in his lifetime. He was introduced to the
show by The Bloodhound Gang on January 26 , 2006 when they pitched Howard for their own radio
show, with Mark as the announcer. During the pitch, Mark showed his penis to Howard (upon
request), who commented on its very large size. Almost two years elapsed before Mark
reappeared, explaining that his mother did not allow him to go places without the Bloodhound
Gang. Mark returned to the show on March 17 , 2008 after an almost two year absence. He explained
that the reason for his absence was that he mother was upset with his homosexual confessions
from his previous appearances. He has a role in Bam Margera’s upcoming film, “ Minghags
“. Mark the Bagger used to be called Wawa Mark by Ursinus College students.



[ edit ] Mariann from Brooklyn



Mariann from Brooklyn is a frequent caller obsessed with Howard Stern. Due to her gravelly and
grating voice, Fred plays sounds of crows cawing when she calls. (She likes to sing the line,
“All I need is Howard in my life” to the tune of Enrique Iglesias ‘ The Rhythm Divine ).
Mariann is a 47 year-old homemaker . The first time the Stern crew met her in person, they were
shocked to discover that she is relatively attractive. She recently rode the Sybian fully
clothed and did not like it.

Mariann called the show on September 12, 2001 to report her sister-in-law missing from the
September 11, 2001 attacks , who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald . It was later revealed she had
perished that day.

On May 17, 2006, she called the show and tried to talk to Artie Lange about the dysfunctional
situation with his girlfriend Dana. Lange became defensive, calling Mariann an “unfunny
cunt “, to which everyone responded in mild disgust, as Mariann seems to have good
intentions. She “diagnosed” Lange with “Sad Clown Syndrome”. She did not ask for an
apology, but instead participated in Lange’s roast on the evening of June 8 , 2006. The two
have since patched things up.



[ edit ] Melrose Larry Green



Melrose Larry Green once carried signs promoting Howard Stern at the intersection of Melrose
and Highland Avenues in Los Angeles, California , near his apartment. He appeared on

handed out a business card proclaiming to be a “ C.P.A. , Piano Player and Marathon Runner”
[ citation needed ] . He is well known for screaming “Good morning, murderer” as O.J.
Simpson headed to the court house during his trial. He has stated that he will also stand
outside and scream at Simpson during his robbery trial.

While frequently calling (and sometimes appearing on) Stern’s show during the 1990s,
Green’s time on the show has been curtailed since about the year 2000, and is currently only
heard on brief call-ins before Howard disconnects him. Like other Wack Packers, Green has
vied for greater fame. He self-published his biography, made several personal appearances,
and had a cameo in a Madonna music video . Politically, he is right -leaning, and is a harsh
critic of Bill and Hillary Clinton . First appearance: 3/27/1992.

Siobhan (pronounced /ÊƒÉšËˆvÉ‘Ë�n/ ) is a male-to-female transsexual often
mocked by Stern and staff. In October 2006, Siobhan had sex with a man known as ‘KDK’,
co-founder of Prank Call Underground Radio, for the first time. Richard Christy, assigned to
document the event, supposedly vomited at the sight of her.

High Pitch Mike, a news producer for Howard 100 news had Siobhan sit on his face as part of a
contest to win a 50 inch TV. Mike won, however the prize allegedly still sits in a box, untouched
because of the trauma he suffered.



[ edit ] Sour Shoes (Michael DelCampo)



Sour Shoes (aka Michael DelCampo ), whose name was coined due to the fetid stench of his feet and
shoes, enjoys singing and playing classic rock songs on keyboard and talking in silly voices.
He sometimes calls the Stern Show for song requests, and has the uncanny ability to recall and
play a song instantly. He still lives with his parents and works part-time helping autistic
children, and claims to have graduated from St. John’s University with a degree in
communications. He does an accurate impression of Scott Ferrall . Sour Shoes is a frequent
caller to other New York radio shows. He is known as “Mike from Mahopac” on the “Mike and
The Mad Dog” sports show, where his specialty is spot-on impressions of broadcasters Jon
Sterling, Howie Rose and Bob Murphy. Stern has frequently quipped “He’s very talented.
I’m just not sure what that talent is.”

Sour Shoes has revealed that he lives in Mahopac, NY.



[ edit ] Wendy the Retard



Wendy the Retard lives in Deltona, Florida and is a frequent guest on The Howard Stern Show . She
is a retarded adult like fellow Wack Packer Gary the Retard , who lives with her mother and
sister. She enjoys bumper bowling and singing pop song karaoke in her bedroom, and will
occasionally do so while calling Howard’s show, clearly to the amusement of those in the
studio. In many of her on-air telephone calls, she answers “yes” to any question from
Stern, no matter how insulting or sexual. Based on her recent conversations with Daniel
Carver, she may also be a racist — or merely impressionable. She is known for an inconsistent
ability to pronounce difficult words, and claimed on-air that, while drunk, she shoved a
tomato up her ass, and ate it. Miss Howard Stern beat Wendy in a trivia contest, and her family
lost to Daniel Carver’s in Wack Pack Family Feud . She claimed to have eaten an entire large
pizza , pancakes , and a McDonald’s meal in one day. She has been the target of Stern prank
calls, including one from fellow Wack Packer Bigfoot (Mark) . She was also a frequent caller on
a central Florida morning radio talk show The Monsters in the Morning (on Real Radio 104.1 as
well as XM Channel 152), wheres she proclaimed her love for Dirty Jim (show co-host).



[ edit ] Will the Farter



Will the Farter can fart on command. At birth, his anus was flawed, and after doctors corrected
it surgically he gained the ability to suck in and expel air from his rectum at will. In November
2006 , Will the Farter proposed to his girlfriend in Howard Stern’s studio at Sirius, which
she accepted.



[ edit ] Yucko the Clown (Roger Black)



Yucko the Clown is a foul-mouthed insult comedian who dresses like a clown . Yucko is also a
street performer who has nearly won two of Stern’s contests; coming second in the World’s
Meanest Listener contest (losing to the Reverend Bob Levy ) and coming third in the Win
John’s Job contest (losing to Richard Christy). He wears clown makeup, including the
signature red clown nose, and carries a bugle horn which he honks to punctuate a punchline.
Yucko will happily insult anyone based on their physical appearance, religious belief or
ethnicity. It has been noted on the Stern show that Yucko has never once washed the clown suit,
and this is obvious due to the general smell and stains found on the costume.

While part of the Stern Show, Yucko was the star of a sketch comedy show titled “
Stankervision ” on MTV2 but was not renewed for a second season. Many of the skits and gags
featured on Stankervision originated on a DVD that Yucko produced called “The Damn
Show.”

[ edit ] Cleft Palate (Lynn Zimmermann)



Cleft Palate ( March 19 , 1952 – March 7 , 2006 ), also known as Lispy Lynn to North Texas
listeners, was a Wack Packer whose speech was very difficult to understand. Zimmermann
claimed to have a cleft palate which was never surgically corrected, and was therefore on SSI
for not being able to find employment. He lived at home with his mother, much like Jeff the Drunk
Curro .

Zimmermann revealed on March 7 , 2006 that he lied about his cleft palate, but insisted he had a
speech impediment from a partially paralyzed tongue . Stern briefly considered renaming him
Pinocchio on account of his dishonesty . Just six hours after admitting to Stern he had no cleft
palate, Zimmermann apparently collapsed and died from complications related to
myelofibrosis and aneurysms on his kidneys . Many local Stern fans attended his funeral.

Debbie the Space Alien (? – April 1995), also known as Debbie Tay , was a mentally ill lesbian
contestant in Howard Stern’s New Year’s Rotten Eve from Los Angeles, California, who
committed suicide by overdosing on heroin in 1995. A saddened Chaunce Hayden announced her
death via telephone on the air and later brought her cremated but unpulverized remains into
the studio during an appearance. Her mother appeared in a video with Debbie which was
pre-produced for the pay-per-view pageant special but died shortly before the actual
pageant . Reportedly, Roach’s relatives objected to Hayden trying to capitalize on
Debbie’s remains, and filed a lawsuit against both the Stern show and Chaunce, which was
later settled.

album Leader of the Banned , and died in 1996.



[ edit ] Dr. Remulak



Obsessive-compulsive caller who would incessantly repeat the phrase “I am Dr. Remulak”
to any reply Howard and company would offer. The only person who would verbally interact with
Remulak was Stuttering John Melendez. He would only have conversations with Stuttering John
during the call screening process. If he slipped up and said something other than his name to
anyone else, he would supposedly smack himself. Remulak asserted that he was in fact a Doctor
and had OCD , hence his repetition of the phrase “I am Dr. Remulak” ad infinitum.
Eventually, he was forced to face his disorder in-studio, and he has not been heard from since.



[ edit ] Gina Girl



Gina Girl (pronounced like the end of the word ‘vagina’). A feeble minded monstrosity who
debuted on Stern as a protÃ©gÃ© of Crazy Jerry . Around `88 or `89 Howard invited
undiscovered potential wack packers to call in to try and get invited to the Christmas party
show. With her weird speech impediment (combined with Jerry’s prodding in the background)
she expressed her desire to come to the Super Bowl party on the show and do what she called, “a
`gina-dance” (Jerry was trying to get her to say: “vagina dance”). Everyone looked
forward to seeing the person that matched that voice and she did not disappoint.

She was reportedly huge, disgusting, and wore like a crude jogging suit. Her
“`gina-dance” consisted of her abruptly yanking her pants off by the elastic waist band
and rolling her fat, naked body around on the floor while everyone yelled/gagged in disgust.
The infamous `gina-dance ended in a chorus of the entire room chanting, “put it on, put it
on…” Howard said, “probably the only time in my life I’ve ever averted my eyes to the
sight of a naked woman.” Later she spoke of her “Mini” skirt and her love for “Tom
Fruise” (Cruise). Within weeks her guardian found out about this and ordered Howard not to
have her on the show, which Howard reluctantly had to accept. Previously, recordings of her
were no-longer played on the air, and her parts had been edited out of produced bits she was a
part of (e.g., the Speech Impediment Christmas Carol ). This changed on the May 29, 2008
edition of the “Dracula Gottfried Meets the Wack Pack” special in which Gina Girl’s
segments were played in full.

Jerry later went out and found a postal worker who also had mental problems called, Gina man and
basically at Jerry’s prompting would yell out non sequiturs , the most famous being “This
is Mother Theresa speaking from the bed, God don’t want me yet, man, I got more feet to
taste.” Jerry and Gina Man can be seen on Howard Stern’s US Open Sores video . Jerry has
since retired to Florida .



[ edit ] Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf (Henry J. Nasiff, Jr)

Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf ( April 20 , 1962 – September 4 , 2001 ), was an alcoholic dwarf
known for his tirades and ongoing feud with Beetlejuice . His passing from complications due
to alcoholism were mourned on the Howard Stern show until his passing was wiped from the front
pages by the events of September 11th, 2001 .



[ edit ] Hate Woman



Hate Woman (or Hate Lady) is another caller who makes very vocal her disgust of Howard, in
particular, of his face. Over the years, she has left numerous voicemails (and possibly
emails, as Howard once alluded to) obsessing over how gross Howard’s face is, how large his
nose is, and how freakish he looks. She has also composed songs and poems to this effect. She is
notable for her grating New York accent and her “Yaaawzzaa!”. Her most famous phrase is
“I saw you…” with heavy emphasis on the word “saw” and proceeds to say that she saw
Howard here or there and that he is hideously ugly. Show staffer Artie Lange used to imitate her
delivery of that line.



[ edit ] Ian the Drunk



Ian the Drunk was a very well-spoken, very well-educated, and very
obviously-intoxicated-at-early-morning-hours Russian man who would call into the show to
insult and ridicule Stern. True to form, Stern would allow Ian to rant and rave but would turn
down the send from the microphones to the telephone patch . Show participants could then
freely ridicule each statement from Ian, who believed he had a rapt audience. (This gag was
also played on celebrities such as Richard Lewis , and Dick Cavett on whom Stern once hung up in
mid-sentence).

Perhaps his funniest show moment occurred in December 1993 when Howard called Joe Walsh to put
him on the phone with Ian while ranting. Walsh, also inebriated , tried (unsuccessfully) to
have a reasonably coherent conversation with Ian. Ian was oblivious to the fact that he was
talking on the phone to a world-renowned rock star, and Walsh seemed equally oblivious to the
fact that Stern and company were having fun at his expense. (A few months later, Walsh entered
rehab and rejoined The Eagles for a new album and tour. As part of his recovery from drug
addiction and alcoholism , Walsh “abstained” from Stern’s radio show, which he had
often visited while stoned . He eventually returned as a Stern Show guest in 2005). Ian was last
heard on the show in 2005, when he declared that he was to be deported to Ukraine .

[ edit ] Ted the Janitor (Ted Green)



Ted the Janitor ( November 24 , 1935 – January 31 , 1996 ) was a janitor at WXRK , who made popular
the game “Road”, which he wanted to play with Robin. The hypothetical game would be played
by having a woman lie down, whereupon Ted would “ blacktop ” her — ie, throw his body on top
of her. He is now deceased. He was on the show occasionally for his unique voice or just for
everyone to hear him hit on Robin. The most memorable bit he was in was “Sukhreet & Ted’s
Excellent Adventure”, a spoof on the movie “ Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure “. The
‘Sukhreet’ refers to Sukhreet Gable, daughter of Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York
State Supreme Court justice. The raspy voiced “excellent” Fred used to play often was
taken from that bit. He was also used in the many parodies of New York’s first black mayor,

Underdog Lady , whose real name is Suzanne Muldowney , [7] [8] is a woman who does performance
art pieces focusing on the exploits of the cartoon character Underdog , and believes the
character was underserved by being comically portrayed on television. She often asserts
that Underdog deserves to be considered among the pantheon of great superheroes , and uses her
performance pieces to emphasize this belief. After a falling out with Stern, whom she came to
view as vulgar and crude, Muldowney described him in an interview as a “classic
supervillain “. During attempts at reconciliation, Stern often tries to curry favor by
mentioning that his father Ben Stern did the audio for the Underdog cartoon show. Muldowney
made her longest show appearance yet on October 5 , 2006 , in a nineteen minute telephone
interview before hanging up abruptly. During the conversation, she reluctantly admitted to
having no sexual feelings for men, and was told as a young girl by a health education teacher
that such feelings were wrong. The following day, Muldowney left a voicemail confiding to
Howard’s producer Gary “Bababooey” Dell’Abate that she was “deeply troubled”
by Stern’s frequently sexually-oriented questions. Stern noted that a cartoon was
playing in the background as she recorded her message. Muldowney is perhaps the most
reluctant member of the Wack Pack. It has been speculated that Muldowney suffers from
Asperger’s Syndrome, an Autism-like condition that caused sufferers to be unable to have
typical socialization with other people. First appearance: 3/3/1992.



[ edit ] Vin the Retard

seems of normal intelligence.



[ edit ] Wheelchair Steve



Wheelchair Steve received sexual favors as a show bit, for which his parents expressed
gratitude. Gary Dell’Abate mentioned him briefly during the June 5 , 2006 show, during the
Wackipedia discussion with Eric the Midget. [ verification needed ]



Yaqi (the Tickler)



Yaqi is a lanky, gray-haired purveyor of tickling fetish -themed DVDs. During Yaqi’s
visits, women (of whom Jenna Jameson was most notable) were strapped to a specially designed
“Tickle Chair” and subjected to prolonged tickling at the hands of Yaqi and Howard
himself; Howard continued this routine long after Yaqi stopped appearing on the show.

Yaqi was known for recording speeches which sought to legitimize tickling as a healthy,
life-affirming activity suitable for man, woman and child. Yaqi was mocked mercilessly by
Artie Lange and other members of Howard’s crew for these speeches, and for being generally
“creepy”.

Yaqi was a regular guest in early 2002 and sporadically thereafter. In August 2004, Yaqi
called in to the show claiming to be terminally afflicted with sarcoidosis .
