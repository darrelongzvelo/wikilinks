JFK Obama and Hatred…

Posted: November 30, 2011 | Author: Wenke | Filed under: politics | Leave a comment »

What Killed JFK , Frank Rich’s New York Magazine’s article, connects the vitriol that
surrounded Kennedy at the time of his assassination to Obama.Â  It is a very disturbing
analysis.Â  But, a must read.

“Immediately after the assassination and ever since, the right has tried to deflect any
connection between its fevered Kennedy hatred and Oswaldâ€™s addled psyche with the
fact that the assassin had briefly defected to the Soviet Union. But at the time even some
Texans werenâ€™t buying that defense. An editorial in the Dallas Times Herald
chastised its own city for supplying â€œthe seeds of hateâ€� and â€œthe
atmosphere for tragedy.â€� The editor of the Austin American wrote that â€œhatred
and fanaticism, the flabby spirit of complacency that has permitted the preachers of
fanatical hatred to appear respectable, and the self-righteousness that labels all who
disagree with us as traitors or dolts, provided the way for the vile deed that snuffed out John
Kennedyâ€™s life.

That atmosphere doesnâ€™t surface arbitrarily in 11/22/63 . Though King had first
considered writing the book in 1971, what inspired him to finally do so was the spectacle of
that Republican backbencher shouting out â€œYou lie! â€� when Obama addressed
Congress in the fall of 2009. â€œOne of the reasons to write the book was because
thereâ€™s so much hate in the air now,â€� he told the filmmaker Errol Morris (also
at work on a Kennedy-assassination project) in a recent interview for the Times website, and
â€œa lot of itâ€™s directed at Obama.â€�

Nature’s Perfect Food

Picasso

A mother and her baby are bonded by the closest possibleÂ  human relationship—-for nine
months they are almost one person.Â  The mother’s body supplying everything needed for
her baby to grow.Â  There is an intense unspoken communication that exists, her baby knows
her voice and her scent. Once her baby is born this bond continues, as her body manufactures
milk specifically for her child, even if her baby is premature or sick. Â  As her baby grows,
the breast milk changes, adapting to the changing needs of her baby.

As important as breast milk is for the baby’s optimum development, the act of caressing your
baby while nursing is as important.Â  This feeling of closeness and connection is
incomparable and lasting for both mother and child.

Occupy the Tax Code

Posted: November 28, 2011 | Author: Wenke | Filed under: politics | 1 Comment »

http://thedailywhatever.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/200-age-of-greed-jeff-madrick-imgcache-rev13061846254651.jpg?w=590

OFFSHORE CORPORATIONS, NONPROFIT OR CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS, BORROWING AGAINST STOCK,
FAMILY TRUSTS….are some of the ways the the ultra rich shield their money from taxes.Â 
It’s all legal, but it must change.

NYTÂ  A Family’s Billions, Artfully Sheltered …

As he stood in the opulent marble foyer of a Fifth Avenue mansion late last month, greeting the
coterie of prominent guests arriving at his private art gallery, Ronald S. Lauder was doing
more than just being a gracious host.

… an heir to the EstÃ©e Lauder fortune whose net worth is estimated at more than $3.1
billion, the evening went beyond social and cultural significance. As is often the case with
his activities, just beneath the surface was a shrewd use of the United States tax code. By
donating his art to his private foundation, Mr. Lauder has qualified for deductions worth
tens of millions of dollars in federal income taxes over the years, savings that help defray
the hundreds of millions he has spent creating one of New York Cityâ€™s cultural gems.

From offshore havens to a tax-sheltering stock deal so audacious that Congress later enacted
a law forbidding the tactic, Mr. Lauder has for decades aggressively taken advantage of tax
breaks that are useful only for the most affluent.

Some tax reform advocates say that it is unfair that the wealthiest can subsidize their
lifestyles using myriad offshore maneuvers and complex accounting strategies.

â€œItâ€™s admirable when people back their charitable impulses up with
donations,â€� said Scott Klinger, tax policy director of the group Business for Shared
Prosperity. â€œBut the tax code shouldnâ€™t allow the wealthy the kind of
loopholes that let them, essentially, force other taxpayers to underwrite donations to
their pet causes.â€�

Ms. Huffington, You’ve Got to be Kidding!

Posted: November 26, 2011 | Author: Wenke | Filed under: politics | Leave a comment »

http://thedailywhatever.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/normal_ian-symbol-weather-vane.png?w=590
Vanessa Grigoriadis writes in her article, Maharishi Arianna , that Ms. Huffington is
disappointed in Obama and could see herself voting Republican in the next presidential
election.Â  Ms. Huffington is quoted saying, “To me the issues are more important than
the party. Trust me, I realize how hard it is to change the system, but Obama has demonstrated
only the fierceÂ  urgency of sometime later and at the same time the middle class is under
assault.Â  Which of course is the topic of my last book.”

“Trust me,” she says.Â  How can anyone trust Ms.Huffington when she could conceivably
vote for a Republican who represents a party that denies a woman’sÂ  right to choose,
supports gutting the safety net for theÂ  needy (did she discuss this in her latest book?),
supports tax cuts for the 1%, denies climate change and wants to drill, drill, drill to end our
dependence on foreign oil—all because she’s disappointed in President Obama.

Somehow this makes me think that Ms.Huffington has the “fierce urgency of me.”Â  She is
reinventing herself once again to further her goals.Â  Over the years she’s been an
anti-feminist, a socialite with a personal guru,Â  an avid Republican, a liberal Democrat
and now, who knows. Â  She has written two biographies, one of Maria Callas the other ofÂ 
Picasso, both times she was accused of plagiarism. Ms. Grigoriadis states that one author
called her an “intellectual kleptomaniac.” Could the same also be said about her
“brainchild,” the Huffington Post?

Well Defined Biceps Look Good…

Posted: November 25, 2011 | Author: Wenke | Filed under: health and fitness | Leave a comment »



Image: http://thedailywhatever.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/bicep.jpg?w=590 The
biceps are responsible for elbow flexion, forearm supination (turning your arm in and out)
and are also involved in shoulder flexion to a small degree.

A strong well defined bicep looks great in a sleeveless shirt, but also helps in many daily
activities that involve lifting, pulling and carrying.

In order toÂ  strengthen and define your biceps,Â  you will need to work with weights in a
pulling motion—bringing your hands, palms facing up (which causes forearm supination),
to your shoulder. This exercise is called the bicep curl .

As always, when working with weights, you exercise the targeted muscle on three non
consecutive days. Start with weights that you can lift for 3 sets of 8 repetitions.Â  The
sets should be challenging, but you should be able to complete them.Â  Holding the weights
firmly (not letting wrists fall back!) but loosely stand with legs shoulder distance apart,
knees bent slightly, tailbone down which flattens the lower back (removing any stress),
abdominal muscles should be contracted toward spine (also for back support) but chest and
shoulders stay relaxed.Â  Upper arms and elbows should be held against the body as you lift
the weights toward your shoulder.Â  Work slowly and in a controlled manner—-with a full
release between each repetition.Â  Once you have mastered the front bicep curl add the side
curl by pressing your elbows more firmly into your side, turning your arms out and pulling your
hands up to the side ofÂ  your shoulder for another 3 sets of 8 repetitions. Again, work
slowly with control and a full release between each repetition.

When you are finished working your biceps, use the weights to also strengthen your
wrists.Â  This is extremely important as we age, when the risk of falling increases. With
arms along side of the body, palms facing back, hold the weights firmly, but loosely— flex
your hands up for 3 sets of 8 and then side ways for 3 sets of 8—relaxing hands between each
repetition.

Any questions about proper body positioning, which is of utmost importance while
exercising, please E-mail me.

Avarice and the Affordable Care Act

Posted: November 22, 2011 | Author: Wenke | Filed under: politics | Leave a comment »







Image: http://thedailywhatever.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/greed1.jpg?w=590



The current Republican Party is the party of the 1% and every proposal suggested by the GOP
lawmakers and presidential candidates preserves or expands tax privileges for the
wealthiest Americans.Â  In Tim Dikenson’s, excellent article in Rolling Stone , he
explains the GOP’s intense hatred of the Affordable Care Act. “To truly understand the
depth of the GOP’s entrenched opposition to Obamacare, it’s crucial to understand how
the reform is financed: The single largest source of funds comes from increasing Medicare
taxes on the wealthy â€“ including new taxes on investment income. According to the Tax
Policy Center, Americans who make more than $1 million a year will pay an extra $37,381 in
annual taxes under the plan. The top 400 taxpayers would contribute even more: an average of
$11 million each. Rarely in American history has a tax so effectively targeted the top one
percent. “It took Republicans about four months to figure out how much they hated it,”
says McIntyre, president of Citizens for Tax Justice. Republican rage over the
president’s health care plan has far less to do with the size of government or the merits of
the individual mandate than the blow to the investor class. If Obamacare remains in place and
the Bush cuts for the wealthy expire as planned, top earners will be paying a tax of 23.8 percent
on capital gains â€“ more than they have at any time since Clinton cut the capital gains
tax in 1997. Health care reform, griped The Wall Street Journal , was nothing but a “sneaky
way” for Democrats to wage a ‘war on the rich.’”

Definition of AVARICE



excessive or insatiable desire for wealth or gain : greediness

built the platform bed a few years ago for an extra room in my house. We recently did some work in
my yard and I decided to take it outside. I purchased an outdoor foam mattress and usually have
more pillows. It has become my favorite place to read a book.

NYPD Stop and Frisk

“The NYPDâ€™s stop-and-frisk practices raise serious concerns over racial
profiling, illegal stops and privacy rights. The Departmentâ€™s own reports on its
stop-and-frisk activity confirm what many people in communities of color across the city
have long known: The police are stopping hundreds of thousands of law abiding New Yorkers
every year, and the vast majority are black and Latino.”Â  The New York Civil Liberties
Union . The statistics compiled by the NYCLU for the last five years are listed below:

In 2007, 468,732 New Yorkers were stopped by the police.

407,923 were totally innocent (87 percent)

242,373 were black (52 percent)

142,903 were Latino (31 percent)

52,715 were white (11 percent)

In 2008, 531,159 New Yorkers were stopped by the police.

465,413 were totally innocent (88 percent)

271,602 were black (51 percent)

167,111 were Latino (32 percent)

57,407 were white (11 percent)

In 2009, 575,304 New Yorkers were stopped by the police.

504,594 were totally innocent (88 percent)

308,941 were black (54 percent)

179,576 were Latino (31 percent)

53,466 were white (9 percent)

In 2010, 601,055 New Yorkers were stopped by the police.

517,458 were totally innocent (86 percent)

317,642 were black (53 percent)

190,491 were Latino (32 percent)

55,083 were white (9 percent)

During the first six months of 2011, 362,150 New Yorkers were stopped by the police.

317,376 were totally innocent (88 percent)

184,186 were black (51 percent)

119,853 were Latino (33 percent)

33,805 were white (9 percent)

How can this not be called racial profiling?!Â
