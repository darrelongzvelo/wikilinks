Ubuntu: I am because we are

I’ve been trying to write a blog reflecting on the past three months but I’m having a hard
time putting an experience like this into words, let alone a simple blog post. I’ve written
one, started over with another, and done that once more. Here is my best attempt.

This trip has been everything I hoped it would be and at the same time nothing like I ever thought
it would be. I have learned more about the world and a way thousands if not millions of people
live than I ever could have imagined. The relationships I have built over the past three and a
half months have literally changed my life. From my internship at City Mission Educational
Service, where the group of students was challenging yet the conversations I had with them
opened my eyes to a life I could never imagine. They were some of the most real, down to earth kids
I have ever met. Working with the Firefighters FC had the same effect on me. I was in a
“dangerous” township, yet I still managed to always feel safe and at home. I am proud to say
I am a Firefighter. I had the most fun doing the “nontraditional” stuff, the kind of things
I never could have done had I done a normal student exchange to an international university. I
got to hang out in townships with local people, which is the only way to truly get to know a place.
In addition to all this work I also got to be a tourist. I climbed beautiful mountains and went on
safaris; I visited vineyards and countless shops; I toured museums and ate at amazing
restaurants; I learned how to surf and jumped off a bridge. All of this shouldn’t be taken for
granted or taken lightly, without it my experience in Cape Town would be incomplete. Through
my classes I learned about the history of South Africa, allowing me to engage in meaningful
conversations with locals; I learned the ins and outs of NGOs, connecting the lessons with my
work at CMES; and I had my previous teachings and ideas challenged, which isn’t always
comfortable.

In addition to all of this, two aspects of Cape Town were the most meaningful: my relationship
with Bongi and my student. The effect these two individuals had on me I cannot even begin to
articulate. They each inspired me in their own ways and saying goodbye to them was the hardest.
I will miss them more than I can imagine and everything they have taught me will affect how I live
my life until the day I die.

Ubuntu is an African proverb that is very prevalent here. The rough translation is “I am
because we are.” I think it relates my trip perfectly. I couldn’t have had the experience I
did without the people I traveled with and the people who I met here. South Africa is a beautiful
country, but it doesn’t even compare to how beautiful its people are. As heavy of a heart that
I have to leave, I’m also incredibly excited to go home and be reunited with my family,
girlfriend, and friends whom I left behind that rainy January morning. I’ll do another,
final blog post later in this week after I get myself settled in at home. Posted by Dan Couture at

How do you teach a teenager how to read?



Two months to learn how to read.

Where do you start?

First with letter sounds: A, B, C, D…what the hell kind of sound does X make? It took me a few
weeks to realize that Z is pronounced “Zetta.” I’m learning as I go.

Next step vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Sometimes Y is definitely too complicated. How do you help
someone with a heavy accent get these sounds right? Long and short vowels, which one is which?
Thank god for the internet.

Let’s try some combined sounds: Ch, Sh, Th, Ing, Er…but sometimes “er” is written
“re” here. If I don’t know it, how do I teach it?

We need games, they make it fun. Matching games, computer games, memory games. But all these
games are for little kids, my student is 16. I want to treat him with a sense of dignity. Looks
like I’ll have to search a bit harder and create some of my own.

Now it’s time for words. Let’s start with the “100 most common words in the English
language.” Thanks Wikipedia. Flashcards. They’re amazing. Let’s go through them
once, let’s go through them again, separate the words we struggle with the most and go
through them one last time.  

Time for a book. First the most basic book, for toddlers almost. We struggled, words were hard.
We have to learn to sound them out. What sound does that “b” make…no, that’s a “d”
sound I said a “b!”  Okay, on to the next book, we’ll take turns reading, I’ll help you
sound out the words.

How do you teach a teenager how to read?

Step by step I worked with my student after school. Once we started a few weeks after I arrived at
City Mission Educational Service he stayed nearly every day. We’d go to an empty classroom,
sit at a desk. I’d take out two pieces of fruit, usually bananas, one for me, one for him.
“Wow thanks! It’s beautiful!” was the typical response. Then we’d start. How do you
teach a teenager how to read? I didn’t know. I made it up as I went along, sometimes right there
on the spot. Progress was slow, but eventually I started to see it. All of a sudden we had the
letter sounds down and we could move on, then all of a sudden words were coming with greater
ease.

My time tutoring my student after school came to an end on Tuesday. The past few sessions we had
been really practicing actual reading rather than the basics that we had spent so much time on.
He would read a simple book, the same one three days in a row, and I would read a chapter in other,
longer book. Our lessons culminated with his biggest book yet, one that had a lot of “big
words.” We started off alternating pages. He was doing great and I kept telling him how proud
of him I was. Then, all of a sudden, he skipped my turn. He wanted to keep reading. Page after page
he read, until almost the very end of the book, when it was finally my turn again. He sounded out
words he wasn’t familiar with, and the best part is, he wasn’t just reading words, he was
reading a story and he comprehended it. Every once in awhile I’d ask him what was going on in
the story and he could articulate it back. It was amazing. All the hours were paying off and were
being justified right in front of me. I can’t even begin to describe the feeling.

This kid has stolen my heart. I spent countless hours with him after school, reading, talking,
laughing. We spent just as many hours outside of school going to soccer matches, the aquarium,
the movies, bowling, and for walks. We have possibly the most opposite lives that anyone could
have but somehow somewhere along the way he became like a brother to me. He has inspired me and
influenced me in ways that I cannot put words to. All I know is that he will be forever with me, in
everything that I do for the rest of my life.

The days are winding down here and goodbyes are becoming more frequent. Today was my last day at
my internship, which meant I had a few dozen students whom I spent the past three months getting
to know to say goodbye to. Not to mention all the teachers who helped me so much along the way.
Later in the evening we had a big Thank You dinner for all our internship supervisors. Two of my
fellow students were asked to say thank you on behalf of all of us, and well, sometimes others
can just say things better than you can. This is an untitled poem written by Nicole Hellthaler
that is a perfect summary of my time in Cape Town.

No one wants to be clichÃ© But I feel I have no choice Because before I even realize These words
escape my voice. We have found ourselves And lost ourselves And found ourselves again. We have
broken down Been beaten down And learned the value of a friend. Our eyes have been opened wider
Forming a new lens Of how the world should be And what we want to mend. We have literally climbed
mountains, To realize there are many more. This time however is different, We are stronger
than before. We have formed bonds so important That we will never be the same. It’s not easy to
say goodbye, And you are all to blame. A thank you is in order, Even though you can never be
repaid. Instead of mourning our goodbyes Let’s enjoy the rest of today.

Goodbyes are never easy, just as she said. Leaving for this semester was difficult, but the
goodbyes were only temporary. We could literally count the months, weeks, days, seconds
until we would see each other again. These goodbyes on the other hand have much greater sense of
permanency to them. I would love to come back to South Africa, but who knows when that will ever
happen. So as I get more and more excited to reunite with everyone back home, I will also be
struggling to say goodbye to those who have affected me in so many ways here in Cape Town.

Vernon, CT



I grew up in Vernon, so when I learned that the man who would be teaching one of my classes and
coordinating my internship while I was in Cape Town was named Vernon I immediately knew I was
going to like him. I had heard about him from past participants: he’s amazing, manages to
place you in the perfect internship, and literally knows everyone in Cape Town. My
expectations were high and I wouldn’t be disappointed. Reverend Vernon Rose has to be one of
the most incredible, humble, kind, and personable persons I have ever met. He has an amazing
life story and recently sat down to tell our class it. Check it out.

To understand where he is now, you have to go all the way back to Vernon Rose’s childhood. As a
youngster, his family was forcibly removed from their home in District 6 to Bridgetown, where
I work and he currently lives. In 1960 his third grade teacher, Dulcie September (an
anti-apartheid activist who was assassinated), gave him his start on a life of activism.
Before he could begin that though, he had to make some noise as an athlete. As a kid he was the
Western Province Community Centre’s Table Tennis Champion and represented the Western
Province in soccer. To give you a perspective, South Africa only has nine provinces. Then, in
the 10 th grade his history teacher played Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have A Dream”
speech and it changed Vernon’s life; he aspired to be like Dr. King. While getting an
undergraduate degree in social work from the University of the Western Cape, a local
university, Vernon worked as a house parent in a children’s home. By the time he was 25 he was
promoted to be the principal.



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e3csd_a1tLw/T5Yx8JxBOAI/AAAAAAAAAKI/-UStxFH7xYA/s320/vernon.jpg
The next stage of his life occurred in the United States when he traveled to UNC Chapel Hill and
Duke. He moved overseas with his soon-to-be wife, Esme, to work at an internship (ironic,
huh?) and study theology. In 1979 he worked with the American Communist Party (before you
freak out at the word communist, remember that Nelson Mandela also worked with the Communist
Party) to get medical supplies to Tanzania. He worked in the prison system where he met with
Benjamin Chavis ( who among many things was an assistant to MLK and Director of the NAACP).
After getting a Masters in Divinity from Duke he moved up to study at Yale to pursue yet another
Masters degree. Being South African, he didn’t realize the prominence of the university.
There, his mentor was Cornel West (arguably the leading African American scholar in the
States). To top off his list of celebrity appearances, Vernon also worked with Stokely
Carmichael (known also as Kwame Ture, who popularized the term “Black Power”) while
State side. Somewhere along the way, Vernon was ordained as a Baptist minister.

The interesting phase of his life starts back in South Africa, where on September 2, 1989, his
birthday, he was arrested and subsequently spent a night in jail for protesting against the
apartheid government. After doing developmental work through the University of Cape Town,
he became the Director of the South African Council of Churches, where he worked with Desmond
Tutu organizing Peace Talks. As if one Nobel Laureate wasn’t enough, as a Regional Director
of the Urban Foundation, Vernon was later invited to attend the World Economic Developmental
Forum where Nelson Mandela was speaking and subsequently was able to meet South Africa’s
first democratic president. Further, he has worked with the top eight gangsters in Cape Town
at the time and helped the National Lottery Board develop policy for their Distribution
Agencies. All of this still doesn’t explain how Vernon knows everyone in Cape Town though.
In the early 90s Reverend Rose facilitated the process of organizing an NGO forum of 4,000
Capetonian organizations. So, traveling through Cape Town with Vernon feels like you’re
traveling with a celebrity, everyone is constantly waving and saying hello.

So what could this man possibly be doing today? Aside from organizing all the internships for
my program and the school of nursing that comes in the fall, he is serving as a consultant for the
government as well as various local organizations. He is currently mediating a case between
two towns, one affluent and the other middle class and colored, that is receiving national
attention. Oh, and he’s also writing a musical.

Personally, I think Vernon should file a lawsuit against Dos Equis, because he has to be the
most interesting man in the world. He never would though, as he is probably the most humble and
modest person I have ever met. He didn’t want to go through his life story with the class
because he didn’t want to talk about himself, and when I asked his permission to write this
blog he took a moment to think before giving me the okay. I am so fortunate to be able to call
Vernon my professor and my role model; this program wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for him.

Life in a Shack



If you’re being politically correct, it’s called an informal settlement. You may also
know it as a shanty town, the slums, or a squatters camp. The houses are shacks made out of
corrugate metal, plastic, or wood. It is poverty in one of its most extreme forms, and Cape Town
is littered with them. On the rainy and dreary day we arrived, an informal settlement was the
first thing I saw coming out of the airport. “Welcome to South Africa, this is what life is
like here.” The entire time I’ve been here I have wanted to walk through one, so I asked my
friend Amanda, who leads the Wednesday night tutoring sessions, to bring me. This morning,
along with her sister, we took a walk through a settlement in Khayelitsha, which by the way has
the largest informal settlement in South Africa.

The sights and sounds were as I expected, though you can never expect the emotions you’ll
experience walking through such a setting. People young and old literally stopped in their
tracks to stare at me as I walked by; white people don’t frequent these parts. Some kids
smiled and waved, a few wanted to shake my hand, others scurried away and hid. I wore my hiking
shoes because I knew I would be walking through dirt, rocks, broken glass, and garbage. Most of
the kids ran around playing barefoot. Kids were everywhere, one group kicked around a flat
soccer ball, two young boys drove around old milk cartons turned into toy cars, and another
group of elementary aged boys and girls played a dodge ball type game with a grocery bag-turned
ball. A woman fetched water from a water spigot to do her washing, while other women hung their
clothes from lines tied to whatever they could find. Men mostly hung around, smoking,
drinking, and conversing. It didn’t matter that it wasn’t even 11am yet. The shacks were
on top of each other; as we walked we would have to squeeze through the maybe foot and a half gap
left in between them. Electricity wires were all over the place, both running along the ground
and from poles up above us. When a line would break, it was simply tied in a knot back together.
 You can imagine how dangerous, deadly, and common fires are in these communities.

Despite it all, the people are proud of their homes and live with dignity. Every shack had a mat
in front, and many times the dirt beyond the mat had been freshly swept. Many people had stereo
systems playing and TVs could be seen through the windows. A couple shacks even had a satellite
dish attached to it. You may be thinking, “Why would these people who live in such poverty
waste their money on material items like that when their money could be better spent buying
food or clothing?” To that, I ask you, have you ever bought something you really couldn’t
afford? Maybe it was a nice electronic, an appliance, a car, a house…you get the point. Why
did you do it? Because you wanted to feel normal, you wanted to fit in, right? It’s the same
with these people, they want to be normal, they want the dignity of feeling like everyone else
even though they live in such poverty. They can adjust to a diet of less food. It was something I
thought about as I walked around the settlement.

The highlight of my time in the camp was visiting a shebean, an informal and illegal bar amongst
all the shacks. Owned by Amanda’s extended family, it had a pool table (to which I said, how
the heck did they get this thing in here), tables, a bar, and a huge speaker playing house music
(essentially just beats). I timidly entered and before I knew it Amanda was arranging for me to
play a game of pool. I don’t play pool, I’ve never been very good, but I couldn’t back out
now. The man I played was serious, early on my jacket sleeve brushed up against a ball and he made
a big fuss about it. Before long he only had two balls left while I had only gotten one in; the game
was looking to go as I expected. All of a sudden I hit a couple lucky shots and had the game tied up
again. By that time a crowd had gathered to watch the white boy play. To the cheers of those
surrounding us, I ended up coming to within one ball. Had we been playing by the rules I’ve
always known I would have won; he scratched on the 8 ball twice. But this was their table, their
shebean, and their rules. I didn’t end up winning, but it was still a pretty cool experience.
I wouldn’t be surprised if I am the only white person who has step foot inside the shebean.  

Visiting an informal settlement was on the list of things I wanted to do that I made shortly
after arriving here. It took me 14 weeks to do it but I’m glad I took my second to last Saturday
here to travel to Khayelitsha for the third time in four days and walk through the community.
It’s certainly like nothing I could ever experience in the States.  Posted by Dan Couture

The Day I Met a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate



There aren’t a lot of things that will get me out of bed before 6am on a Friday where I otherwise
have nothing to do. It’s hard to believe that one of those things is to go to church. But this
isn’t just any church. It is St. Georges Cathedral, an iconic church in the struggle against
apartheid. And this wasn’t just any service. It was being led by Archbishop and Nobel Peace
Prize recipient Desmond Tutu. He typically leads the Eucharist every other Friday, but with
the Easter holiday his schedule was interrupted. We forgot to call the office to see if he was
scheduled for today, so we took a shot in the dark and decided to get up early just in case. Luck
was on our side, and after a brief introduction by a priest to tell us not to take pictures during
the service the archbishop emerged. To say I was excited would be an understatement. Here,
maybe twenty feet away from me, was one of the forefront figures in the struggle against
apartheid and global human rights, a world famous peace activist whose name is mentioned
along with the likes of Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama. In addition to the Nobel Peace Prize
he has been awarded numerous prestigious honors, including the Order of Vasco Nunez de
Balboa, one of Panama's highest honors, which he had received just the day before. 





Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ImUB6AJY6Bs/T5G6Ge4rG-I/AAAAAAAAAKA/4EITnodZHRU/s320/Tutu+from+my+seat.jpg
I'll admit it, I snuck a picture during the

service. This is the view from my seat

The service was almost identical to the Episcopal services I grew up going to, which made me
feel at home in an environment I'm no longer comfortable in. I wasn't he only one out of place
though; out of the five of us only one attended church regularly and another was Jewish! The
service proceeded as I remembered from my childhood up until the sermon. I was really curious
as to what Archbishop Tutu had to say, hoping to hear some profound wisdom only someone like him
could possess. Instead, he went around the small chapel and asked each group where they were
from and what they were doing in Cape Town. The four girls I was with asked me to stand and
introduce our group. All of a sudden my heart was racing and I was as nervous as could be; I was
about to stand up and speak directly to this world-renowned peace keeper. I wanted to say
something meaningful, but in the end I simply told him we were from the University of
Connecticut and we had spent the past three months working with local organizations. Much to
my surprise, he thanked us for our work. 

When it was time for "Peace" my nerves had dwindled and I was determined to shake Father Tutu's
hand. It required me walking through a maze of chairs and striking up a half-hearted
conversation with a Trinity College professor to get that handshake, but I succeeded. As I sat
back down I was in a state of shock. Once again I was in awe of the situation I was in, I kept
thinking about everything this man has accomplished and the influence he has had on the lives
of thousands, if not millions, of people. 

Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YO5OzAdhtso/T5G5_qdpP5I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/f0CCbezyaNs/s320/Tutu+for+blog.jpg

The service ended and Archbishop Tutu positioned himself at the exit to the chapel and shook
each visitor's hand. I said a few words to him when it was my turn and he joked with me about how
hold he is and no longer can remember anything. For being 80 he is in incredible health and is
full of energy and humor; he was malking us laugh and laughing himself the entire time we were
there. We then had the opportunity to take pictures together, where he jokingly scolded us for
blinking and having to retake the picture. The rumors I had heard about him were true, Desmond
Tutu is tiny. From standing next to him, I would say he is maybe 5'4" on a good day. We ended our
time at St. George's in the cafe below the church, next to a photo memorial of a 30,000 strong
march against apartheid the archbishop led in the 80s. As we grabbed a bite to eat and talked
about the service we watched as the archbishop sat nearby with a group of his colleagues. When
it was time for him to leave, the tiny peace keeper gave us a wave goodbye accompanied with a big
smile. It was a fitting end to the lighthearted morning on the day I met a Nobel Peace Prize
Laureate.  Posted by Dan Couture at 12:57 PM No comments:

This Isn't "Based On A True Story"

A month or two ago I was in my sixth and seventh grade class when we started having a discussion
about life. One of my seventh graders started talking about when he was younger and lived on the
streets at the tender age of 8. It was one of the many harsh realizations I’ve had to face
during my time in Cape Town. Unfortunately I had to cut the conversation off because we needed
to move on in class, but the student asked me if I would buy a journal for him to write in for me. The
next day I presented him with it and he spent his interval break writing me. To say the least I
wasn’t prepared for what he had to say. He further divulged into a life I cannot imagine
living, talking about a broken home and internal struggles. We went back and forth a couple
times in the journal until one day he didn’t show up with it. He left it somewhere and it was
gone. Much to my surprise, the first day of school back from a two week holiday he presented me
with another journal, which he purchased with the little money he had, already written in.
Once again we wrote back and forth, which gave me an idea. In school yesterday I asked him if he
would write out the original story he told me of his earlier life so that I could share it with
people back in the States. His response: “Sure, then people will understand what life is
like.” So these are his words, exactly as he wrote them in our journal. I typed it exactly as it
was written, though I’ve taken out some information, like his name and where he lives, and
tried to clarify any of the spelling that I could. This isn’t some dramatized movie that is
“based on a true story,” this is a true story. This is real life.  

My name is [removed] and I yose [used] to stay in a play [place] colled [removed]and I stay with
my mother and sister and a small brother but the problem was that my mother was adicted to
drinking beer and sometime my brother’s father used to come to live with my mother. and
somethimes he would get so drunk that he and mother would fight and mabey would fight over a beer
and would Atack each other so from than I stated staying on the [s]treet and some times would
sleep on people’s yarsd and would sleep on toilest, old places and my mother would evrythime
when she was drunk she would hit me over old stuff that I did and condore [couldn’t, I think]
remember me off [of] old stuff that I did [w]rong and after that my mother got tiyed [tired] of me
and in 2008 sanded [sent] me to This place where I met new faces and made new freands and This
Place was better then my original house It is colled [removed, but it is a shelter for young
boys, many of whom are coming off living on the streets. Many of my younger students live
there]. So now I live here for 5 years and from that day I niticed one thing in my life and that was I
was growing very fast and Im still 12 but the Thing Thath makes me Happy in my hole life is that my
mother is changing from bad to good. So ser Dan that’s my hole story. The End. From
[sad/crying face] to [happy/smiling face].

He turns 13 this Thursday. Once again I am forced to think back as to what I was doing at that age.
The answer? I was getting on a plane by myself bound for Ohio to spend two weeks at my aunt and
uncle’s house, where I would ride horses and four wheelers and swim in their pond without a
care in the world. How privileged I was, and I didn’t even know it. Later in his journal he went
on to thank me essentially for being a positive influence on his life and not giving up on him
(“I must thank you ser. becase there is now [no] one that would waste his time with a brat like
me…your are the most coolest ser [teacher] Ive ever had in my hole intie [entire] life Thank
you very much for diong this…you…has changed my hole life”). He told me to “remember
The crazy boy who allwase [always] wanted your hiar (that’s a whole different story!)  and
never foget me and I never foget you.” As if I could forget someone like him… Posted by Dan

Now Batting for Team America

It is amazing how complete strangers will step up to the plate for you here. This evening a group
of six of us was traveling home on a taxi from Khayelitsha where we were tutoring the
Firefighters soccer players. At the taxi rink (essentially the taxi station, and remember,
“taxi” really means 15 passenger public transport vans and not what we refer to as taxis in
the States, those are cabs) we grabbed a taxi bound for the city, and while we waited for it to
leave Alex and I bought a piece of hot corn from a local kid. Though it was only R7 (just under $1)
we were having issues coming up with enough change so the girls we were with started digging in
their purses looking for another coin. Much to my surprise one of the women sitting near us also
was digging in her purse for a R1 coin for us. The taxi was leaving so we ended up just giving him an
uncounted handful of small coins, hoping that it totaled the R1 we needed, but it was still
awesome to see a random woman willing to give us money when we needed it.

Later in the drive two of the interns with me paid the driver a R20 bill to cover their R12 fee, but
the driver never gave them their change. The same woman from before went up to bat for the
Americans and called out the driver. The entire conversation was in Xhosa, the predominant
local language among the black community, but it was animated enough to follow along. The two
went back and forth and the conversation gradually elevated; this woman was really going
after the driver for not paying us. Having heard enough, the driver pulled the taxi over on the
highway and told the woman to get out, which she flatly refused to do. Instead, she tried to pay
the two their change out of her own earnings. Eight rand to us is pocket change, but it’s a
different story to a lot of Capetonians where every penny counts. It was a sincere and
heartfelt gesture, but the girls politely declined her offer.

The outbursts calmed but the tension was still in the air. When we got to the place where we were
getting off the woman wouldn’t let us leave until we had our change. The girls ended up
getting their money and we left, but the woman was left to fight her own battle to get her R8
change back from easily the rudest taxi driver I’ve ever encountered. We were strangers to
this woman, no names were exchanged and more than likely we’ll never see her again, but she
put us before herself and made sure that we were taken care of. It’s common practice, but it
still surprises me.

This was an interesting lesson that I think a lot of American’s could use, especially in our
treatment of foreigners.  Posted by Dan Couture at 1:43 PM No comments:

Old Mutual Two Oceans Half Marathon

Earlier today I participated in the Old Mutual Two Oceans Half Marathon, dubbed “The
World’s Most Beautiful Marathon.” The race had two themes, my Achilles tendon, which I
had somehow hurt during a training run two weeks prior, and the weather, which was forecasted
to be 60 degrees and raining for the 6am start. Before we get ahead of ourselves though, we need
to start with the International Fun Run, a 5k which took place on Friday morning. I was
skeptical and cynical going into it, the title just sounded silly and plus I spend a lot of my
time trying to blend into the Capetonian culture rather than proclaiming my foreignness. The
run turned out to be awesome (and it was also way longer than 5k, my guess it was 4 miles). The
weekend’s race had 80 countries represented and at the event Friday people were dressed up
in their countries colors and a flag from each nation was distributed to one of its citizen’s
to carry. It was a lighthearted atmosphere and the route spent most of the time along the
shoreline. Unfortunately, my Achilles, which I had been resting for the past week and a half,
tightened up at the end of the run, making me nervous for the next morning.

The half marathon turned out to be possibly the biggest mental race I have ever run. We arrived
at the start in the dark, the overcast sky hiding the full moon above; warming up, my Achilles
was tight and sore and no matter how much I stretched it I couldn’t make it comfortable. I had
emailed my high school cross country coach looking for advice, and his words were in the back of
my head. “My advice is to avoid this race…don’t be a hero, you need your heel for a lot more
activities than races.” Was I being stupid trying to run this? How will I know when enough is
enough and I need to stop? Will I be able to make myself bail on a race I spent the past three months
training for (not to mention over $100 registering for)? At what point in the race will I reach
the mark where no matter what I’m going to finish? Hurting my Achilles now would probably
keep me out for the majority of the summer, and I already have a bunch of bike races, triathlons,
and running races on the schedule. Before I had answered most of these questions in my head the
gun went off and the race had begun. With over 16,200 people registered to run, the start of the
race was extremely crowded and the darkness added a whole new element. At least it wasn’t
raining.

It took just about 15 minutes for the pack to loosen up so I could get into a groove. Having never
run in kilometers before, I had no idea how to pace myself, so every 5k I took my split. My first
split was 30:28, way slower than I wanted it to be due to the start, meaning I had some catching up
to do. At the 10k mark (26:59 split, 57:28 into the race), two things changed. My Achilles
finally loosened up, allowing me to relax a bit and just run, and the weather changed. I felt it
happen; the sky got dark, the wind picked up, and the temperature dropped. On top of this a 5k
long hill, arguably the hardest part of the race, started. At least it wasn’t raining.

It started raining just as I reached the 13k mark. It started light but picked up until it was a
downpour with a strong wind that would whip tiny rain bullets into your eyes. By the 15k mark
(27:16 split, running for a total of 1:24:44) I was soaked all the way through. I picked up my
pace and spent the last few kilometers battling the driving headwind. I crossed the finish
line unofficially at 1:53:26, working out to be an 8:39/mile pace. This wasn’t the fastest
half marathon I’ve run, in fact it was my slowest (out of two previous races), but there was a
sense of accomplishment I felt crossing the finish line that was absent in any of the previous
endurance races I’ve completed. I had won the mental battle and ran a great race. In the end my
Achilles held out and the weather waited as long as it could before it released its wrath on the
runners. Now I can say I’ve run 13.1 on two continents, and I have the medal to prove it!

Soccer is just the head fake

As a high school graduation gift, one of my best friends’ parents gave all of us the book
“The Last Lecture.” It quickly became possibly my all-time favorite book and I have read
it every summer since. The author, Randy Pausch, was a professor at Carnige Mellon who was
diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer when he was asked to give the symbolic “Last
Lecture,” which turned out to truly be his last lecture. Throughout the book he talked about
living life to its fullest and learning lessons along the way. A lot of what he talks about has
stuck with me, but in particular one of his points has been creeping into my life here in South
Africa. It’s called a head fake. The head fake is the underlying message and agenda that
someone implements in whatever activity they are doing. For Randy, his head fake during his
speech was that his purpose for speaking was really for his kids, as they wouldn’t have their
dad around to tell stories and teach those life lessons.

Recently, I came across possibly the best head fake I’ve seen so far. In my last blog post I
talked about my good friend Bongi who coaches the Khayelitsha Fire Fighters , a local youth
soccer team. The thing is, what Bongi and the other Firefighter coaches do is so much more than
coach. They are leading, they are serving as positive role models, they are teaching life
lessons. On Wednesday nights the older boys get together to do their homework and receive
tutoring when needed, which the UConn students have been helping with. After tutoring we run
life orientation classes, which essentially teach different life skills and life lessons.
The players love it; they embrace everything we do, to the extent that they asked Amanda,
Bongi’s friend and an aspiring teacher who is running the Wednesday night sessions, if they
could get together to do homework more than once a week.

The kids don't eat the entire day during tournaments, so we

bought some food and drinks for them on Saturday. The Fire Fighters started as just an idea that
the head coach, Power, had years ago to throw together a soccer team to give kids something to do
after school and keep them off the streets. It has evolved into an amazing program that uses the
few resources they have to put together amazing teams. The boys are incredible players, from
the U11 to the U17 teams, and they do incredible work off the field too. This past weekend I spent
at a tournament for the U11 and U15 teams, where most of the other clubs there were well
established soccer academies with corporate sponsors, meaning they had all the funding and
resources one could want. Both teams went 2-1 in normal play and qualified for the playoffs.
The U15s won a hard fought quarter finals match but fell short in the semis 2-1. They played well
and showed maturity beyond their years in their lost, keeping their heads up and reflecting
back on it later in the day. The U11s won their first match with ease, but the semi finals came
down to the wire, ending on penalty kicks, where our goalie made some great saves and our
players some beautiful goals. It was on to the finals game, against one of the afore mentioned
“corporate” teams sponsored by Old Mutual, a company that sponsors EVERYTHING in South
Africa (including my race next weekend). The two teams were well matched, they played neck and
neck, but Old Mutual came out on top 2-1, scoring on a free kick and a questionable penalty kick
from a handball in the box.

Picking up crying ten and eleven year olds off the field and telling them they have nothing to be
ashamed of is as heart wrenching as it sounds. I wasn’t lying to them though. These kids
played as if they were twenty years old and had been playing together since they were eleven.
They are a group of township kids who practice on a small strip of dying grass littered with
rocks and broken glass, who share their cleats, shin guards, socks, shorts, jerseys, water,
food, and literally anything else you can think of because they can’t afford their own. Yet
despite all this they can play with the teams who have all the funding in the world.

The Fire Fighters U11 team before the finals with coach Bongi No one likes to see the Fire
Fighters win. I lost count how many times this weekend opposing coaches would make a query on
the age of certain players or the legitimacy of their paperwork after we beat them. It was
enough that by Sunday afternoon the tournament directors knew me by name. Yet despite all of
this the players were good sports, they barely complained and they won and loss with class.
I’d like to end this rather long blog post with one of the most rewarding moments of my
weekend. A random fan had talked to me a couple times throughout Sunday, saying he liked the
Fire Fighters and was rooting for them. At one point he stopped me and asked me where the team was
from, so I responded with Khayelithsa, knowing he wouldn’t be expecting us to come from such
a far off and “poor” township. Then he asked if we were an academy and who our sponsors were.
I smirked and responded, “They’re just a group of kids who get together and play in the
park, no academy, no sponsorships.” All he could say was “damn, they’re good.” If
only he knew just how amazing the players really are.  Posted by Dan Couture at 12:37 PM No
