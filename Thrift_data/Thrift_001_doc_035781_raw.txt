    Top African distance running nations, Kenya , Ethiopia , Eritrea, Uganda and host South
    Africa will jostle for honours tomorrow at the 2nd CAA Africa Cross Country
    Championships , at Keurboom Park in Cape Town. With the absence of a World Cross Country
    Championships in 2012, the Africa Cross Country Championships will serve as the biggest
    event this year. Â  Athletes from 16 other nations such as Morocco, Equatorial Guinea,
    Ethiopia, Congo, Egypt, Uganda, Mauritius, Rwanda, Mozambique, Zambia, Angola,
    Botswana, Sudan, Namibia, Swaziland, Malawi, Lesotho and Zimbabwe are also expected at
    the continental event. Â  The host Country's 24-member team is spearheaded by
    national 3000m record-holder and cross country champion, Elroy Gelant, who was a
    finalist at the recently concluded IAAF World Indoor Championships in Istanbul. Â 
    Kenya, one of five of the strongest countries in the world, has sent a team of 16 athletes
    (four athletes in each category) to defend their title. However, this policy carries an
    element of risk because in case of a withdrawal or injury to a team member, Kenya will not be
    eligible for the team prize as four athletes are required to finish.Â Â  Â  Kenya
    dominated the World Cross Country Championships in Punta Umbria, Spain, in March 2011
    with African countries such as Ethiopia and Uganda finishing 2nd and 3rd respectively.
    Eritrea finished 4th, just ahead of South Africa for their best ever team performance.
    Â  In 2011, Kenyaâ€™s team took the first four positions in the senior
    menâ€™s race, the first five positions in the senior women, while the junior men and
    women made a clean sweep of the first six positions. Â  Event Previews: Â  Senior Men
    South Africaâ€™s Elroy Gelant will compete at his first international Cross
    Country event on Sunday after returning from the World Indoor Championships that took
    place in Istanbul from 9-11 March. Â Gelant set a new South African Record in the 3000m
    when he crossed the line in 7:48.64. Â  Â  Gelant comfortably won the trials in
    Potchefstroom on 18 February but did not join the team in Mauritius for the Southern
    Region Cross Country Championships on 3 March as he competed in the 5000m at the second
    Yellow Pages Interprovincial in Bellville. Â  Gelant made no secret of the fact that
    his athletics season has not officially started yet, but what he has achieved so far
    motivates him to qualify for the Olympic Games in London. Â â€œI am aware that
    Sunday will be a big challenge, but my main goal is to be as competitive possible as
    individual and as a team.â€� Â  â€œKenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Eritrea will
    be our biggest competition,â€� said Gelant, â€œmainly because of their
    cohesion and ability to do so well as a team.â€� Â Gelant will be joined by David
    Manja, Boy Soke, Lungisa Mdadelwa, Dean Brummer and Kgosi Tsosane. Â  Teklemariam
    Medhin is one of the Eritreans that can be a thorn in the flesh of team South Africa.
    Â With 6 World Championships in Cross Country behind his name (2 as junior athlete in
    2006 and 2007 in Fukuoka and Kenya) his experience will go a long way to assist his team in
    running for a team prize. Â He also helped his team finish 4th at the 2011 World
    Championships in Spain by finishing 14th overall. Â In 2010 at the World Cross Country
    Championships in Bydgoszcz Medhim won the silver medal. Â In 2008 he represented
    Eritrea in Edinburgh, 2009 in Amman. Â  Sudanâ€™s only team, a senior
    menâ€™s team, includes Adam Abdelmunaim. Â He is not a newcomer to Cape Town,
    having competed as a junior in 2011 where he finished 7th. Â This 19 year-old went to the
    World Cross Country Championships from 2009-2011 (Amman, Bydgoszcz and Spain) where he
    represented Sudan. Â His 31st place finish in 2011 was his best at a World Cross Country
    Championship as a junior athlete.Â  Â  With Zambia sending only 3 senior men (and 2
    junior women) to compete in Cape Town, Tony Wamulwa is their most experienced athlete on
    paper. Â At the first Africa Cross Country Championships in Cape Town in 2011 Wamulwa
    finished 7th. Â  Senior Women Abebech Afework Bekele is probably the most experienced
    athlete in the Ethiopian camp as she competed at the Cross Country World Championships in
    2010 where she finished 14th. Â In the same year she also represented her country at the
    World Championships in the Half Marathon where she finished 14th in 71:38. Â  South
    Africaâ€™s Mpho Mabuza, finished 2nd at the National trials a mere two weeks after
    she won the silver medal at the SA Marathon Championships in George. Â  In Mauritius at
    the Southern Region Cross Country Championships Mabuza won the gold medal. Â 
    Swazilandâ€™s only athlete at the Africa Cross Country Championships Winile
    Mnisi is also a marathon runner. Â In 2010 the Commonwealth Games in Delhi she ran her
    personal best, finishing 13th in 3:18.32. Â  Junior women South Africaâ€™s
    junior womenâ€™s team, lead by the Cross Country Trials winner Sylvia
    Tshetlanyane will be hoping to challenge of the Kenyan and the very young junior
    womenâ€™s team from Uganda. Â  Â  Kenya will be represented amongst others by
    the World Cross Country Champion Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon. Â Kipyegon won the
    World Championships in Punta Umbria, Spain (20 March 2011) in 18:53. Â  Â  In 2010 at
    the World Championships she finished 4th. Â She also represented Kenya at the World
    Youth Championships in France in July where she became the 1500m World Champion in
    4:09.48. Â  Ugandaâ€™s Nancy Cheptegei and Stella Chesang have some
    international experience, as both these athletes represented Uganda at the World Cross
    Country Championships in Spain last year. Â The 17 year-old Cheptegei finished 18th
    while Chesang, now 16 years-old, finished 39th. Â  Aynslee van Graan finished 2nd at
    the National trials in Potchefstroom and is aware of the big challenge ahead on Sunday.
    Â â€œThe competition will be tough, but I would love to help my team win a
    medal,â€� said Aynslee who will be joined by sister Kyla in the team. Â â€œWe
    always train and run together and would love to be like the Phalula sisters one
    day,â€� was Kylaâ€™s comment after being asked about the sisterhood
    rivalry. Â  Junior men The junior menâ€™s team will consist of Tumisang
    Monnatlala, Sello Masia, Sello Mokwena, Sithembile Dondolo, Zweli Nzima and Thapelo
    Madiba with the entire team competing at their fist International event as only a senior
    team was selected for the Southern Region Cross Country Championships in Mauritius.
    Â  The trials in Potchefstroom produced competitive racing with the top 3 athletes
    only decided in the final lap. On Sunday 18 March, the team will have to work together for a
    team medal. Â  Â  Monnatlala, who won the trials, is very happy to be in the team and
    feels very privilegded about his inclusion in the team. Â â€œIt shows that hard
    work really pays off, but the competition will be tough on Sunday.â€� Â  One of the
    Malawian junior men is Grevazio Mpani who will be back in Cape Town for the second time
    after his 8th place finish in 2011.Â  Â  Venue: Â  Western Province Cricket Club,
