decided to ban not only Chiranjeevi 's films, but also his son Ram Charan Teja 's films and
nephew Arjun's films. [ 3 ]





Box Office and Reception

Though the film had good openings, the reaction was mixed and didn't fare as expected. It was
also not listed in the "2009 hits" list of any leading newspapers. Arya 2 emerged as the second
biggest hit of 2009. The film collected 16+ rs a in its first week including 4+ rs from Nizam and 1
rs from Visakhapatnam district. But there was a huge drop in the collections in the second week
because of the Telangana Agitation. The film was banned in all Telangana regions because of
Allu Arjun 's relation with Chiranjeevi . Dil Raju, the distributor of Nizam has lost about one
and a half rs due to the Telangana Agitation. But Arya 2 has been declared as a major hit and the
second major hit of 2009 after magadheera worldwide. [ 4 ]
