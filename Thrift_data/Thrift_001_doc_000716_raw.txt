Yogis are most desirable candidates for jobs July 25, 2012

Meditation makes you more balanced and joyous. People love to beÂ around happy people, and
will understandably enjoy your company. Â An inner magnetism will start to
beÂ expressed, and somehow, you may not know why, but you will find almost everyone eager to
work with, or for you.Â 

Interestingly Â in the job world you become a desirable candidate for any recruiter
because of your charisma and dynamism. Â The reason behind this is that regular
meditations increase your energy level and you yourself will start emitting vibrations, or
essentially everything positive. People can feel it and they actually love it, even if they do
notÂ understand theÂ source of it.

This is what I’ve learned fromÂ several recent recruitment experiences: among many
candidates people who meditatedÂ were selected as the best, although the recruiter or
client knew nothing about the yogic background of a job candidate.

PeopleÂ practicing yoga and meditation are more luckilyÂ to be selected for a job.

So the new career rule says: MEDITATE and you will be successful!

What is fun? July 22, 2012

Innocence is the way you really give fun to others, create the fun part of it.Â  The fun is
created only through innocence and innocence is the only way you can really emit also the
fun.Â 

Imagine this world without any fun, what would happen?Â 

But people are very much confusedÂ between fun and the pleasure.Â  The pleasure is nice
to begin with and horrible to end with.

But fun is a treasure. Anything that is full of fun you remember all your life.

Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

How to enjoy yourself during troubles July 17, 2012

The idea for this post came fromÂ my recent holiday experience where due to some technical
problems many thingsÂ went wrong and various difficulties had to be fought.

I noticed with surprise that despite the complicated situation IÂ remained peaceful and
yet dynamic andÂ took right and benevolent decisions. SomehowÂ I was not at all
bothered, althoughÂ at times theÂ situation was a total disaster. At some point I
realised that this is what my Guru Shri Mataji Â used to underline many a times: ” you have
to enjoy yourself, then nothing can upset you”. Â  AndÂ I was indeed enjoying!

Since my life is in general free of problems, I seldome have a chance to experience it so
clearly.Â However last weekÂ I was lucky enough to undergo a good test…Â  AndÂ I
found out how easy it is, to enjoy myself in every situation. How did I reach this state? – no
idea, most probably thanks to the years of meditaiton

Why women are more sensitive to Spirituality June 26, 2012

A mere glance at various spiritual practitioners grasps the female dominance . Disregarding
country and cultural background. Now more than at any other historical period .Â  People
wonder why women areÂ seeking more then men, why are they outnumbering in that sphere of
life?

The answer is as simple as genius: Men just have a biggerÂ ego which does not allow them to
surrender easily, for surrender is one of the coreÂ spitirual features.Â ” Real
men” are so-calledÂ doers and while acting they are not inclined to think of themselves
as of “God’s instruments”. Due to their nature, men are more on the rightÂ side,
using theirÂ right sympathetic nervous system , being proactive, dominant, thinking,
directing… All that blocks their emotional side, the side which brings one faster to God
because of the connection through the heart.

At the same time the greatest saints, yogis are prophetsÂ of all times are mostly male. How
to explain all that? The men who trulyÂ become the men of God, theyÂ managed
toÂ overcome their ego and along with their male nature, could develop their female side as
well. They became compassionate, loving and forgiving. Thus, balancing and enriching both
sides they in fact managed to become the perfect humans. For some ironical reason, if a woman
starts using her male side (“right side”) as much as the female one, she is more likely to
become an unpleasant rather that a holy personality… (more…)

The Divine Feminine in Islam June 16, 2012

Filed under: thoughts — axinia @ 11:06 pm

Tags: Buraq , Christianity , Gabriel , God , Goddess , Islam , Jesus , Mary , Muhammad , Muslim ,
Quran , Sufism

BURAQ

The fanaticism that we see in modern Islam is a new development in a religion that, in its early
history, was famous for its tolerance and respect for other religions. In Islamâ€™s
classical period in medieval Spain and Egypt perhaps only Buddhism rivalled Islamâ€™s
tolerance. The fundamentalism that characterises the behaviour of many of todayâ€™s
Muslims is in fact anti-Koranic.

While the Muslim vision is often perceived to be authoritarian and punitive the Koran, on
close inspection, is filled with descriptions and vision of Godâ€™s more feminine
attributes such as gentleness, providence, love, universal compassion and
tender-heartedness.

The religious intolerance that characterises the behaviour of many Muslim communities
today is inconsistent with the heritage of tolerance that is professed by the Islamic
tradition. For example, the Koran clearly states in several passages that any person who
lives a life of holy reverence is welcomed into paradise regardless of their religion.
Muhammad openly praises both Judaism (Abraham is deeply respected within the Koran) and
Christianity (Muhammad frequently praises Jesus and Mary in the Koran).

Even more surprising is the Koranâ€™s reverence for Mary, mother of Christ . Muhammad
(and also in later Islamic theological scriptures) regarded Mary as the most marvellous of
all women, a high adept and living example of the pure and holy life. Later Koranic
commentaries describe Mary as an intervening force between God (Allah) and humanity. This
intervening force is characterised by Allahâ€™s mercy, forgiveness, sweetness and
humility- the embodiment of Allahâ€™s love for creation.

In one of the most powerful Hadiths ( prophetic sayings of Muhammad) it is reported that
Muhammad said, â€œParadise is at the feet of the Motherâ€�. Does this suggest that
the feminine aspect of God is an important and essential pathway to the attainment of supreme
consciousness?

Muhammadâ€™s peak defining experience, called the Meraj, saw him elevated through the
seven heavens to the realm of God Almighty at the resplendant Sidrath where he communed with
God, received his divine visions and instructions and was placed on the inexorable course of
his life-mission to establish Islam. Muhammad was escorted by the archangel Gabriel (a
masculine force) but the vehicle upon which Muhammad rode was the beautiful â€œBuraq
â€�. The Buraq was a white horse with wings and the face of a woman! Clearly suggesting
that the great power by which Muhammad was elevated to the level of supreme consciousness was
ultimately feminine in nature! Some scholars say that the Buraq is an Islamic symbol of the
Kundalini , a force that Eastern Yogis describe as the Goddess or Divine Mother. (more…)

Why I believe every woman should gain some kindergarten teacher experience June 10, 2012

This is a topic I wanted to cover long ago. However I waited until I got my own child and my
feelings and beliefs were confrimed.

Yes, I believe that every woman should gain some working experience as a kindergarten
teacher. This is a strong statement and I am sure many people would not only be surprised but
also react negative to it. Let me give my arguments based on my personal experience and
observations.

About 10 years back I was lucky enough to work as a kindergarten teacher in one international
school (children 4-6), which I still consider the most outstanding and enriching experience
in my careerÂ  -Â even thoughÂ since last 6 years I holdÂ managerial positions and
now heading towards a company director. And who knows, may beÂ it was that childcare
experienceÂ which in fact boosted my career?

Throughout a history when people used to have big families women /girls have helped in the
household and in the childcare for their own sisters and brothers. These days are gone in the
civilized society. Today thanks to the epidemic of adultÂ infantilism, more and more
grown-ups consider having children a burden. There are various reasons for that
child-phobia but one of the reasons is simply lack of experience.

I believe it is a great experience to work with a groupÂ of children (not one or two!) for
several reasons:

1. Being in charge ofÂ  at least 10 children is the best ATTENTION training you can ever get.
Small children, especially before age of 6 are extremely active and curious, they easily
spread around, everyone busy with his/her own stuff. But surprise, surprise — at some point
you will understand that it is easier to manage 10 children than one!

Some amazing quotes on love by a Sufi master June 1, 2012

Â 

The word love is derived from the Sanskrit word Lobh , which means desire, wish; the same word is
used in the Russian language, Liubov. Love may be called in other words the desire to be
conscious of the object of love.

***

It is for this reason that we admire all those whom we love, and are blind to the good qualities of
those whom we do not love. It is not always that these deserve our neglect, but our eyes, without
love, cannot see their goodness. Those whom we love may have bad points too, but as love sees
beauty, so we see that alone in them.

***

Â As love is the source of creation and the real sustenance of all beings, so, if man knows how
to give it to the world around him as sympathy, as kindness, as service, he supplies to all the
food for which every soul hungers. If man knew this secret of life he would win the whole world,
without any doubt.

***

A heart burning in love’s fire has a tendency to melt every heart with which it comes in
contact.

***

Â Â Â  Love is inherent in every soul. All the occupations of life, however important
or unimportant, in some way or other tend towards love; therefore no one in the world can be
called entirely loveless.

***

Â Â  Love is above law, and law is beneath love. There is no comparison between them; one is
from heaven and the other from earth. Where love dies law begins. Therefore law can never find a
place for love, nor can love ever limit itself within law, one being limited, the other being as
unlimited as life. The lover can give no reason why he loves a certain one, for there is a reason
for everything except love. (more…)

I’ve got the answer on Willpower! May 21, 2012

The question about the nature and meaning of WillpowerÂ kept me busy for some time. I even
postedÂ about it already twice, but still I could not understand what is the mystery
behind. The other day I talked to an old friend about some private issues and suddenly he
dropped a sentence that “The willpower is there to overcome the
negativity/circumstances/destiny and thus to make another step in the personal
evolution”. That’s it, I thought!

For instanse people who had problematic parents and difficult childhood – now they are
comfortable in the victim position andÂ say Â ”you know I have so many problems
because of my childhood”. But why not overcome it? The Will Power will serve greatly if one
takes to it.

Indeed, what is the fineÂ border betweenÂ aÂ destiny and willpower? All great
spiritualÂ Masters talked about both, that a lot is already predestinedÂ and Divine
Plan does exist. At the same time a human being has the Free Will,Â which makes us different
fromÂ animals. If we use this Free Will we evolve further. Thus, at some point the Free will
becomes the Will Power, the force that makes many great things happen.

ObviouslyÂ today the question ofÂ Willpower is not popular. I remember in the Soviet
Union we were broughtÂ up on the ideals of heroic people – not like Superman, but real
heroes, Â existingÂ people,Â  people who showed wonders of Will Power in their
personal achievements or their work for others… Either in the industrialisation period,
or during the Second WorldÂ War or even after. I find it’s pity that today’s children
miss that kind of upbringing. Today they only learn the ego-boosting.

I made my personalÂ experiences with Willpower – not many but still some. I know what it
feels like and I know how much courage it demands. And finally it’s a great mixtureÂ of
thrill and discipline. A strange mixture that makes every personal journey worth tryting.

LOVE

The secret of my self-confidence May 17, 2012

Filed under: thoughts — axinia @ 10:07 am

Tags: Confidence , Environment , feeling guilty , Self-awareness , Self-confidence , Social
Sciences , Understanding

I was often told that one of the most fascinating things about me is the refreshing
self-confidence. Some readers consider this blog interesting mostly because of that – the
way I share my experiences, the self-confident straightforwardness which does not make
others feel guilty is what apparentlyÂ makes my blog attractive.

Some people ask me about the secret behind this quality:Â Â How can I be so
self-confident and at the same time not going into ego , the border is very fine as we all
know…It’s time toÂ reveal the secret!

I guess there are two things that make it:

1. I know myself very well. Since I was a child I was busy with discovering who I am, what my
strengths and weaknesses are, I have always been introspective and seeking. This brought me a
great advantage – the AWARENESS. I am aware of what I am. I know very well what makes my
personality and what is still to improve. I know well what I am bad at. Or good at. This AWARENESS
is whatÂ makes me confident.

But this is not enough! There isÂ the second part of it which is quite rare in people, at least
in the West. (more…)
