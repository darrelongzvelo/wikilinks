7-7-07 Lucky or Unlucky?





Image: /image_store/uploads/9/4/6/1/1/ar118363862711649.gif

 

How many of you have a lucky number? How many of you are true believers in the horseshoe. If you
noticed the picture to the right, the horseshoe is facing down. Some believe that it needs to be
pointing up so the luck doesn't fall out.

This Saturday will be July 7th, 2007 which will show up as 7/7/07 . Believers are calling this
day the Magnificent Seven because it could possibly be the luckiest day of the century. 

They are talking about wedding chapels and casinos being busier than normal with an onslaught
of fortune-seekers. People will be seeking positive vibes, betting on 777 , and gamblers will
be enjoying 777 which is the top slot machine jackpot.

 

    The number seven arises so often, you would be surprised on how many things will represent
    the number 7 . Let's take a look. 

    - The seven wonders of the World

    

    - The Seven Dwarfs

    

    - The Seven Deadly Sins

    

    

    - Seven days of the week (each day named for one of the seven Roman gods

    

    

    - Mickey Mantle wore the number 7

    

    - The Bible says that God rested on the seventh day

    

    - The earth has seven seas

    



And so much more.......

 

But, there will be those that don't believe in this and that seven will not be all things to all
people. For some, 7/7/07 is a day to look back, not forward.

 

Overall.....   how many of you will be hitting the casinos?  How many will be getting
married? It so happens, my lucky number is 7 . Will I strike it rich?  Just for the fact that I am
10 miles from Atlantic City.  hhhhmmmm  And don't forget, shattering a mirror brings seven
years of bad luck. Myself? It is more a mind over matter approach. What se thee?

I had heard Saturday was 7-7-07. Well, I hate to gamble, so no casino's for me. I'm already
married for 30 years in August. So I guess I'll just see how the day unfolds.

Missy....  Yes, I forgot about Chad Henne....  soooo sorry. ;o)  He was good, but they had
good receivers, right?  Which can make the QB better at times.

Desiree....  right now, still down at the shore with my nieces and nephews and family.  We
are leaving Saturday and it happens to be my nieces b-day. Not sure if I will get down there.

Our entire church has been on a 40 day fast (it doesn't have to be food) that ends on the 7th. We're
having a big service Saturday night. And You Tube is having a huge get-together in New York this
weekend for everyone who's really active there, to meet each other face-to-face. And I'm
entered in a contest that ends on 7-7-07 also.  Seems everyone's cashing in on this one =) Lisa

Well - togetherness isn't so bad since everyone is betting the same number :^)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_in_Chinese_culture

Lucky numbers

Lucky numbers are based on Chinese words that sound similar to other Chinese words. The
numbers 6 , 8 , and 9 are believed to have auspicious meanings because their names sound similar
to words that have positive meanings.



[ edit ] One

The number 1 Can represent unity. 168 being "to continue being prosperous" (see below).



[ edit ] Two

The number 2 (äºŒ, èr ) is a good number in Chinese culture. There is a Chinese saying "good
things come in pairs". It is common to use double symbols in product brandnames, e.g. double
happiness, double coin, double elephants etc. Cantonese speaking people like the number two
because it sounds the same as the word "easy" (æ˜“) in Cantonese.



[ edit ] Four

The number 4 is considered lucky in some regions of China where it is homonymous in the local
dialect to the word "äº‹" (job, business, or task). When the number 4 is encountered
during a celebration, people would often remark "å››å››åŠ‚æ„�",
which would also refer to "äº‹äº‹åŠ‚æ„�" (Everything done as wished);
however, it is more commonly seen as bad luck in modern times, especially in dialects where its
pronunciation is homonymic to the word "death" (æ­»).



[ edit ] Six

The number 6 , pronounced "liu", sounds like the word for "flowing", "smooth" or "slippery"
which can mean "everything goes smoothly".

The number 666 is considered one of the luckiest numbers. It can be seen prominently in many
shop windows across the country, and people there often pay extra to get a mobile phone number
including this string of digits. Coincidentally, that number is considered to be demonic in
Western culture , as it is the Number of the Beast .

License plate number AW6666 was bought for 272,000 yuan (US$34,000) in an auction by an
anonymous bidder on behalf of a motorcycle dealership in Zengcheng, Guangzhou . [1]



[ edit ] Seven

The number 7 symbolizes "togetherness". This is shown in the Chinese mythology of Cowherd and
Weaver Girl . The seventh day of the seventh month is The Night of Sevens .



[ edit ] Eight

The word for "eight" in Chinese ( Pinyin : bÄ�) sounds similar to the word which means
"fortune", "prosper" or " wealth " ( å�‘ , Pinyin : fÄ�). In regional dialects the
words for "eight" and "fortune" are also similar, eg Cantonese "baat" and "faat".

There is also a resemblance between two digits, "88", and the shuang xi (å›� -- 'double
joy'), a popular decorative design composed of two stylized characters å–œ ( xi , 'joy',
'happiness').

Some people also think that 8 can be associated with the symbol meaning infinity (an 8 turned 90
degrees).

Telephone number 8888-8888 was sold for USD $270,723 in Chengdu , China .

The Summer Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to open on 8/8/08 at 8:08:08 p.m. [2]

A man in Hangzhou offered to sell his license plate reading A88888 for 1.12 million yuan . [2]

Dragon Fish Industry in Singapore , a breeder of rare Asian Arowanas (which are "lucky fish"
themselves, and, being a rare species, are required to be microchipped ), makes sure to use
numbers with plenty of eights in their microchip tag numbers, and appears to reserve
particularly numbers especially rich in eights and sixes (e.g. 702088880006688) for
particularly valuable specimens. [3] [4]



[ edit ] Nine

The number 9 (jiu) , sounds like the word for "longlasting" (ä¹… pinyin jiÇ”). 11:16am

Well, I live kinda close to a casino or two.  One that I know of is having something special on
7-7-07 - a drawing for $7,777 cash.  Plus they have Bingo and they are having some special
prizes on that day too.  Might have to put AR down for a day or at least until I come back.

I know Sunday I will reach my 100th post and I am definitely going to be here at AR to celebrate. 
I would do my 2 remaining posts today or tomorrow but I will only get 18 points for them because I
have used up my week's allowance.  So I will wait.  I already have the posts written.  Am I
good or what????

SO I am asking early.... I need readers and comments for my celebration. plz Rosemary

Gary.....    well, that's a start. Maybe it will get better throughout the day.



Tom....   I would guess that someone would have to lose. Just put a bunch of 7's in your
pockets.  ;o)



Suzanne... .  that's cool, because I have two lucky numbers and 7 is one of them. I guess time
will tell.



Lisa..... this sounds interesting. I just hope it didn't have to be food, that would be tough
for me. ;o)

Overall, yes, it seems like so many are cashing in on this.  thanks for sharing... 

Rob.....    thanks for all of that information. I'll have to take a look at it later this
evening.

Sally.... . that could still be lucky. Again, everyone has their different days, lucky
charms, etc etc.



Rosemary....   there are several around here having prizes of $7,777 and $777. In regards to
your 100th post coming up, congrats. I'll keep an eye out for it. Jeff Belonger-The FHA Expert -

Jeff,

I'll have to buy a lottery ticket on Saturday.....  07/07/07 will be a luckier day than last
year's 06/06/06.

Thanks for the post....I never realized how significant the number 7 is.

I didn't know 7 was that powerful either.  I just might have to change my 100 post party to
07-07-07 so that I can get some more luck in my life.  I consider luck blessings so I should say
blessings.

Stay tuned because there just may be a post party schedule change.  Which means I have 1 more
post to go and I just might have to give up the 200 points (and get something like 18) because this
of all weeks is the week I have done my 10 postings and that is the limit.   Stay tuned.

I hope to see you at my celebration later.  And thank you for letting me share it on your blog. 
Bring something, surprise me! smile

At the very least, it makes for some fun dialogue back and forth.  I believe it was Thomas
Jefferson who said, "I believe very much in luck, and I find that the harder I work, the more I
have of it" (or something to that effect)

A lot of time, your luck is a state of mind and what you make of it.  It will be interesting to see
how many people bet the farm on 777. Steven Shewell, The Mortgage Maverick (Primary

Jeff, I promised I'd let you know if 7-7-07 was a lucky day for me. 

    Except for (THIS IS IMPORTANT) : the blessing of getting up and in good health and finding
    my family and friends all in good health and in tack, I had my "pretend party" and I also went
    to the casino near me.

    - we rode the bus for only $5 with a $10 off the bingo game- return upon arrive.  Well we
    arrived and got that $10. Plus I won the raffle on the bus and got an additional whopping $5
    off my bingo

    

    - All was going great up to this point, until we got to the bingo and found out they had ran out
    of machines and I had to purchase paper (which means you do alot of dobbing or is it
    bobbing)  So I wasn't going to go sit in the bus and wait for everyone that got a machine to
    come out so I purchased the paper.

    

    - Then.... no seats available or so it seemed until I spotted a lady with a seat for her
    purse.  I kindly asked her if I could use the seat and the look she gave me wasn't nice....
    not at all

    

    - Then the game begin... none of my numbers came up.  In a death lineup that would be great
    but at bingo that is not good.

    

    - After I gave up and realized I wasn't winning a dime in bingo, I gathered my nerves and
    headed for a 777 machine.  Oh did I forget to tell you that there were more people there
    than machines by at least 5 times??? so no machine to sit at.  Had to stand for what seemed
    like a lifetime, just to see if I was going to be lucky and win something.  I finally got a
    machine and got down to a low $$ amount (so low I can't print it) and WHAM! the machine heated
    up..... HOWEVER....

    



it was time for my bus to leave.

So in summary.  Was 7-7-07 lucky day for me.  YES, I'm still living. I TOLD YOU THE
EXCEPTION WAS IMPORTANT.     lol
