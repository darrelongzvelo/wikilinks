  dear people welcome

A television program (usually television programme outside North America ), also called
television show , is a segment of content which is intended to be broadcast on television . It
may be a one-time production or part of a periodically recurring series. A single program in a
series is called an episode .

A television series that is intended to comprise a limited number of episodes is usually
called a miniseries or serial . Series without a fixed length are usually divided into seasons
or series , yearly or biannual installments of new episodes. While there is no defined length,
US industry practice tends to favor longer seasons than those of some other countries.

A one-time broadcast may be called a "special", or particularly in the UK a "special episode".
A television movie ("made-for-TV movie" or television film), is a film that is initially
broadcast on television rather than released in cinemas or direct-to-video , although many
successful TV movies are later released on DVD .

A program can be either recorded—as on video tape or other various electronic media
forms—or considered live television .

[ edit ] Program content



Television programming may be fictional —as in comedies and dramas , or non-fictional
—as in documentary , news , and reality television It may be topical—as in the case of a
local newscast and some made-for-television movies, or historical—as in the case of many
documentaries and fictional series. They could be primarily instructional or educational ,
or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows .

A drama program usually features a set of actors in a somewhat familiar setting. The program
follows their lives and their adventures. With the exception of soap operas , many shows
especially before the 1980s, remained static without story arcs , the main characters and the
premise changed little. If some change happened to the characters lives during the episode ,
it was usually undone by the end. (Because of this, the episodes could be broadcast in any
order.) Since the 1980s, there are many series that feature progressive change to the plot,
the characters, or both.

Common television program periods include regular broadcasts (like news), series (usually
seasonal and ongoing with a duration of only a few episodes to many seasons), or miniseries ,
which is an extended film , usually with a small predetermined number of episodes and a set plot
and timeline. Miniseries usually range from about 3 to 10 hours in length. In the UK, the term
"miniseries" is only usually used in reference to imported programmes, and such short-run
series are usually called " serials ".

Older American television shows began with a title sequence showing opening credits at the
bottom lower third of the screen during the beginning, and included closing credits at the end
of the show. However, beginning in the 1990s some shows began with a " cold open ", followed by a
title sequence and a commercial break. Many serial -type shows begin with a " Previously on...
" (such as the series 24 ) introduction before the new episode. And, to save time, some shows
omit the title sequence altogether, folding the names normally featured there into the
opening credits. The title sequence has not been completely eliminated, however, as many
major television series still use them.

While television series appearing on TV networks are usually commissioned by the networks
themselves, their producers earn greater revenue when the program is sold into syndication .
With the rise of the DVD home video format, box sets containing entire seasons or the complete
run of a program have become a significant revenue source as well. Many of the prime-time
comedy shows and Saturday morning cartoons were digitally remastered for United States
television around mid-May 2008, as there will be more original and reissued DVD sets of
television programs containing either entire seasons or complete series to come.

Television has changed throughout the years, from wholesome family sitcoms and dramas of
years ago, to the reality shows of today. When watching television became popular in the
mid-20th century, the whole family watched one set together. Also, many channels have
deviated from their original programming focus throughout the years because of channel
drift .

Most television networks throughout the world are 'commercial', dependent on selling
advertising time or acquiring sponsors , broadcasting executives' main concern over their
programming is on audience size or eyeballs . Once the number of 'free to air' stations was
restricted by the availability of channel frequencies, but cable TV (outside the USA,
satellite television ) technology has allowed an expansion in the number of channels
available to viewers (sometimes at premium rates) in a much more competitive environment.

[ edit ] Development



[ edit ] United States



A person decides to create a new series. The creator develops the show's elements, consisting
of the concept , the characters , the crew , and cast. They will then offer ("pitch") it to the
various networks in an attempt to find one that is interested in the series and order a
prototype first episode of the series, known as a " pilot ".

To create the pilot, the structure and team of the whole series needs to be put together. If the
network likes the pilot, they will pick up the show to be aired the next season (usually Fall).
Sometimes they will save it for "mid-season" or request rewrites and further review (known in
the industry as " Development hell "). And other times they will pass entirely, leaving the
show's creator forced to "shop it around" to other networks. Many shows never make it past the
pilot stage.

If the show is picked up, a "run" of episodes is ordered. Usually only 13 episodes are ordered at
first, although a series will typically last for at least 22 episodes (the last nine episodes
sometimes being known as the "back nine"—borrowing the colloquial golf term).

The show hires a "stable" of writers , who usually work in parallel: the first writer works on
the first episode, the second on the second episode, and so forth. When all of the writers have
been used, the assignment of episodes continues starting with the first writer again. On
other shows, however, the writers work as a team. Sometimes they will develop story ideas
individually, and pitch them to the show's creator, who then folds them together into a script
and rewrites them.

[ edit ] United Kingdom



In contrast to the US model illustrated above, the UK procedure is operated on a sometimes
similar, but much smaller scale.

The method of "team writing" is employed on some longer dramatic series (usually running up to
a maximum of around 13 episodes). The idea for such a programme may be generated "in-house" by
one of the networks; it could originate from an independent production company; it will
sometimes be a product of both. For example, the BBC 's long-running soap opera EastEnders is
wholly a BBC production, whereas its popular drama Life on Mars was developed by Kudos in
association with the broadcaster.

However, there are still a significant number of programmes (usually sitcoms) that are built
around just one or two writers and a small, close-knit production team. These are "pitched" in
the traditional way, but since the creator(s) will handle all the writing requirements,
there will be a run of six or seven episodes per series once approval has been given. Many of the
most popular British comedies have been made this way, including Monty Python's Flying
Circus (albeit with an exclusive team of six writer-performers), Fawlty Towers , Blackadder
and The Office .

[ edit ] Production

Main article: Television production

The executive producer , often the show's creator, is in charge of running the show. They pick
the crew and help cast the actors, approve and sometimes write series plots (some even write or
direct major episodes). Various other producers help to ensure that the show runs smoothly.

As with filmmaking or other electronic media production, production of an individual
episode can be divided into three parts. These are:
