Optimus Prime is the main protagonist and leader of the "heroic" faction (primarily the
Autobots) in most of the various Transformers continuities. After his ship crashed on Earth,
he remained unconscious for millions of years, then an earthquake on Tuesday, May 8, 1984,
awoke the ship's repair system, which then repaired him and adapted him to have the ability to
transform to an Earth vehicle. He is the leader of the Autobots, a faction of heroic
Transformers from the planet Cybertron who wage their battles against the evil forces of the
Decepticons. Optimus Prime is depicted as a heroic, brave and compassionate character who
puts all his talent to use to improve the universe around him. Optimus has a strong sense of
justice and righteousness, and has dedicated himself to the protection of all life,
particularly the inhabitants of Earth; he will battle his foes with unyielding resolve. [1 ]

The original Optimus Prime transforms into a cab over truck. The truck's cab transforms into
the robot mode of Prime himself, with vast strength and armed with a laser rifle. Contained
within his chest is the mystic talisman known as the Autobot Matrix of Leadership (or Creation
Matrix, depending on the continuity), carried by all Autobot leaders and passed down through
the ages. The comic book continuities tend to claim that Optimus' direct predecessor as Prime
and thus bearer of the Matrix was Sentinel Prime, a fact which is part of the Dreamwave comics
canon. In the cartoon continuity, it is unknown from whom Optimus inherited the talisman, as
Optimus is already named as a Prime when Alpha Trion rebuilds him from his former
selfâ€”which appears to indicate that Alpha Trion may have given Prime the Matrix at
that point, just after the transformation of Orion Pax into Optimus Prime. This change is
depicted in the episode War Dawn . The truck's trailer disconnects and transforms into the
Combat Deck , a mobile battle-station/command headquarters with an "Auto-Launcher" robot
armed with assorted artillery and beam weapons. It can also serve as a radio antenna for
battlefield communications between the Autobots. The Combat Deck can launch Prime's third
component, Roller , a mobile scout buggy that can easily slip behind enemy lines. Optimus'
senses are tied into Roller's, and can perceive what Roller does. Injury to one component is
felt by each of the others, and while Prime could survive the destruction of either, despite
the slight degree of autonomy they possess, the Combat Deck and Roller would not be able to
survive without him.

Additional powers included in the animated series and comics are short-range optic blasts,
holographic map projections and deployable hydro-foils designed by Wheeljack which
allowed Prime and the other Autobots to traverse bodies of water with ease. One of Prime's
abilities was the ability to retract his right hand unit and replace it with a glowing axe.



Across the assorted continuities of the original Transformers universe, there have been
various interpretations of Optimus Prime. One of Prime's most notable characteristics in
any form was his adamant commitment to leadership by example, and avoidance of any hypocrisy
in his command, but beyond this, the animated series leaned towards Optimus Prime as a
straightforward, wise and essentially upbeat battlefield general. The Marvel Comics
series, on the other hand, in addition to these more obvious characteristics, suggested a
Prime secretly plagued by self-doubt and, more importantly, a conflicted sense of pacifism
that often made him an extremely reluctant warrior. It was occasionally implied that the
conflict with the Decepticons lasted as long as it did primarily because of his unwillingness
to take a more aggressive stance.



The animated series revealed other minor details about Optimus Prime's personality and
personal life â€” for example, his dislike of rap music("Blaster Blues" and "Quest for
Survival"), which set him at odds with music-loving characters like Blaster and Jazz. Prime
also enjoys televised sports, most notably basketball which he even plays ("The Master
Builder"), as well as setting up a basketball court outside the Ark. Though Prime's
personality is like that of a human man age 40-50, he is not above watching afternoon soap
operas (in the episode "Prime Target", he is heard groaning out loud when the soap opera he is
watching with the other Autobots gets interrupted for a news report).

Edit



Note: Stories from the U.K. Marvel Transformers series are in italics.



In Marvel Comics' comic series, before the Great War broke out on Cybertron, the robot who
would be Optimus Prime (before he received the Matrix of Leadership from Sentinel Prime) was a
Transformer of note, displaying his skills in the Infraformers Sharpshooting Competition.
Subsequently, when the war began, Prime quickly made a name for himself as a combat leader of
the Autobots.



On a mission with the Triggerbots to stop Megatron from claiming the Underbase, Prime was
forced to jettison the massive databank into space to prevent anyone from acquiring its
power, but with this action, he proved his wisdom and skill to the Autobot Council of Elders;
this led to even more rapid advancement, eventually leading him to field command over the
Autobot armies.



Four million years ago, Cybertron â€” shaken from its orbit and drifting through space
â€” came under threat when it floated into the path of an asteroid swarm. Prime led a group
of elite Autobot warriors on the Autobot starship, the Ark, on a mission to destroy the
asteroids, and although successful, in the aftermath of this mission the Ark was attacked by
Decepticons, hoping to overcome their weakened foes. Intent on keeping the secrets of the Ark
from the Decepticons, Prime set the craft on a suicide course, crashing it into the
prehistoric planet Earth.



In 1984 A.D., a volcanic eruption re-activated the Ark, which in turn brought the
Transformers back on-line. Prime led the Autobots in their opening battles to prevent the
Decepticons from plundering Earth's resources, but following their initial victory, the
Transformers were all deactivated by Shockwave. Prime was decapitated by Shockwave, and had
the energy of the Creation Matrix leeched from his mind to give life to Shockwave's creations,
the Constructicons (although Shockwave was unaware that the Matrix was not merely a program
in Prime's mind, but a physical object in his chest). Before Shockwave could give life to his
next Decepticon, Jetfire, Prime transferred the Matrix energy into the mind of Buster
Witwicky, who used the energy to turn Jetfire on Shockwave, allowing Prime to reclaim his body
and retake leadership of the Autobots, giving Jetfire true life as a reward.



[1]

[2] Optimus Prime meets President Ronald Reagan Around this time, he would even meet Ronald
Reagan in a story in the 1985 U.K. annual.



Meanwhile, however, the U.K. offices of Marvel Comics were producing their own storylines.
Here, writer Simon Furman offered a different take on Prime, one that was weary of the war he had
been forced to fight. In the "Prey" storyline beginning in U.K. #96 Prime arranged for a
Wheeljack built copy of himself to be destroyed to see how the Autobots could cope without him.
Unfortunately the plan was derailed by Megatron and the Predacons, who attacked him. During
the battle Prime, Megatron and Ultra Magnus were transported to Earth â€” with Prime
accidentally interrupting his own funeral service. This theme of war-weariness would again
come to the fore in the U.K. strips detailing Prime's U.S. death.



After a period of effective leadership which saw the activation of several new Transformers
including the Aerialbots, who Prime infused with life using the Matrix, Prime engaged
Megatron in a video game duel for possession of a super fuel. Prime was victorious, but
Megatron implemented a cheat code that killed Prime later. Autobot surgeon Ratchet's
subsequent efforts to restore him were unsuccessful, and his body was launched into space,
the Autobots unaware of the presence of the physical Matrix object within the corpse. The
funeral barge eventually crashed on a giant moon; as it lay there for an untold time, the Matrix
reached out to nearby living organisms, studying and recreating them. One such recreated
being became known as Death Bringer.



Prime's personality had been copied onto a floppy disk by the technician running the game,
Ethan Zachary, who employed him in various video game scenarios he developed. Prime's
damaged mind led him to believe that he himself was a video game character, and in an attempt to
bring him back to life, Goldbug, Joyride, Slapdash and Getaway took the disk to the planet
Nebulos. They built a new body for Optimus Prime, and even upgraded it with the ability to
combine with the trailer to form a larger robot. In an effort to keep Transformers off their
planet, however, the Nebulans had poisoned their fuel, and the sensation of dying convinced
Prime that he was truly alive, and not a game character. To save his life, the Nebulan scientist
Hi-Q bonded with him, creating Powermaster Optimus Prime . A UK story set around this time in UK
#198 would see Prime as the star of his own Christmas special, as he returned to Earth and tried
to rekindle his feeling for the planet. After a battle between his own forces and an advance
force from Cybertron ruined a small town's Christmas festivities he realized bringing the
Transformers to Earth was far worse than anything his troops could have done and vowed to
protect its inhabitants from Decepticon aggression.



Optimus Prime's first actions as leader were to ally the Autobots with Scorponok's
Decepticons in defeating Starscream when the later gained the power of the Underbase.



In the U.K. Transformers stories, Prime and his Autobots later battled a murderous mechanoid
named Death Bringer, which Prime recognized as a creation of the Matrix.



Later, the Transformers were all transported to Cybertron by Primus to battle Unicron, Prime
managed to successfully reacquire and purify the Matrix after Unicron killed Thunderwing
and his taint upon it. Prime then sacrificed his life one more time to destroy Unicron by
plunging the Matrix into his maw. However, the Powermaster process had been working to fully
bond Prime and Hi-Q, and with Prime now destroyed, the process completed itself in Hi-Q's
body, and the two minds and souls became one. Hi-Q's biomechanical body was stripped down and
reconstructed by the Last Autobot, resurrecting Optimus Prime once more with the two minds
now one. Prime joined with the other Transformers on the planet Klo and routed Bludgeon's
Decepticons.



Prime would appear in the U.K. Marvel comic issue #234, "Prime's Rib!" This story is set in the
near future, 1995, where Optimus Prime, Jazz and Hot Rod introduce the latest Autobot,Arcee,
to the human feminists. She was met with displeasure by the humans, being called a token female
and disliked for her pink color. They were then attacked by Shockwave, Fangry,Horri-Bull and
Squeezeplay, who thought the Autobot would be unveiling a new weapon. The Autobots fought off
the Decepticons, who escaped, but nothing seemed to please the human feminists.



[3]

[4] Generation 2 Optimus Prime An undisclosed period of time later, at the beginning of the
Transformers: Generation 2 comic book sequel series, Prime was restored to a form resembling
his original body, and he and the Transformers found themselves caught in the schemes of a
"second generation" of Cybertronians led by the icy Jhiaxus, who were colonizing and
cyber-forming other worlds. Plagued by nightmarish visions of a life-destroying entity
called "the Swarm," Prime looked into Cybertron's past and discovered that Jhiaxus and his
kind were the result of further unintentional Transformer reproduction, their nature and
intent distilled to the purest, most unemotional form of conquest, and that the Swarm was the
by-product of this process. Entering into an alliance with the recreated Megatron's
Decepticons to combat the Swarm and Jhiaxus, Prime was consumed by the abomination and
destroyed, but at the last moment, unleashed the energies of the Matrix into the Swarm,
purifying it. In parting, the Swarm recreated Prime in a new form, (based on his "Hero" toy),
and he and Megatron set out to lead the united Autobots and Decepticons into a new age. [2 ]

Edit



[5] [6] Orion Pax As seen in the episode "War Dawn", Optimus Prime began his life as a robot named
Orion Pax, a mostly defenseless dock worker during the Golden Age of Cybertron nine million
years ago, with a girlfriend named Ariel, and a best friend named Dion. At the time, a new breed
of robot had recently appeared on the planet with new flight capabilities in robot mode that
made Orion idolize them. Unfortunately for Orion, when Megatron, the leader of the new group
of robots, approached him with inquiries about using one of the dock warehouses, Orion was
swayed by Megatron, and he and Ariel were severely wounded when Megatron and his forces then
attacked in order to claim the energy stored there. Searching for someone to help them, the
time-displaced Aerialbots took Orion and Ariel to the ancient Autobot, Alpha Trion, who used
them as the first subjects for the new reconstruction process he had developed â€”
rebuilding the frail Autobot frames into battle-hardy configurations. With this
reconstruction, Orion Pax became Optimus Prime, the first of the Autobot warriors. [3 ]

Optimus took the mantle of leadership as the civil war against the Decepticons erupted, and
would remain in that position for the next four million years. Ariel was rebuilt into Elita
One, the commander of the Autobot resistance on Cybertron. [4 ] The fate of Dion is left
unrevealed. It has been speculated by fans that Dion might have become Ironhide just as Orion
and Ariel became Optimus and Elita, but this remains fan speculation only, and there is no
evidence to support the idea, Ironhide's close friendship with Optimus notwithstanding.



[7] [8] Optimus Prime's energon axe As leader of the Autobots, Prime headed up their mission to
search out new worlds with new sources of energy to revitalize the depleted Cybertron.
Optimus vowed to Elita that he would return from his mission for her, but just before the launch
of the Ark, Optimus was mistakenly led to believe Elita was killed. Shortly after its launch,
the Autobots' craft was attacked by the Decepticons' space cruiser, the Nemesis , and boarded
by Megatron and the Decepticons. In the ensuing struggle, the G-forces of a nearby planet
pulled both craft down, and the Autobots' ship crashed into a volcano, thrusting all the
occupants into emergency stasis. Four million years later, in the Earth year 1984 A.D., a
volcanic eruption jarred the ship's computer, Teletraan I back to life, and it reactivated
the Decepticons, programming them with new Earth-based disguise modes. As a parting
gesture, Starscream fired upon the Autobot ship, creating a landslide. The vibrations from
that landslide knocked Prime into the path of the computer's restoration beam, restoring him
to life, and beginning the war anew on Earth.

Prime was perpetually at the forefront of the action throughout the early years of the war on
Earth, usually confronting Megatron, and, in some rare instances, being forced to team up
with him for the greater good (or the lesser evil) - such as against the Insecticon-controlled
Decepticons or the Combaticons. He has suffered his fair share of battlefield scrapes,
almost meeting his end when his vital cosmotron component was critically damaged by the
Decepticon jets and Laserbeak, having his body be disassembled and turned into Decepticon
trophies (such as turning much of his body into a pet "alligaticon" and one of his arms into a
defense laser).



Prime suffered a severe â€” though unfair â€” defeat when Megatron challenged him
to one-on-one combat while imbued with the different abilities of all the Decepticons. The
loser would leave Earth. However, Teletraan I discovered the deception in time and the
Autobots were able to drive the Decepticons off. In "Prime Problem", Megatron created a clone
of him, which cause confusion with the other Autobots which lead to tests. However,
Windcharger and Spike were able to identify the clone before it led the Autobots into their
demise.



In "Prime Target", the big game hunter Lord Cholmondeley set his sights on the ultimate
trophy, the head of Optimus Prime. In order to lure Optimus in, Cholmondeley captured the
Autobots Tracks, Bumblebee, Jazz, Beachcomber, Grapple, Blaster and Inferno. Windcharger
and Huffer were able to avoid being trapped. When Cosmos learned of the location Cholmondeley
was keeping the captured Transformers, Optimus Prime accepted Cholmondeley's challenge to
meet him alone. Although interrupted by the Decepticons Astrotrain and Blitzwing's attempt
to ally the Decepticons with Cholmondeley, Optimus defeated the big game hunter and freed the
Autobots. Cholmondeley and the stolen jet were handed over to the Soviets by the Autobots as
punishment for his actions.



Throughout the first two seasons, Optimus Prime has led the Autobots to many victories, like
stopping Megatron from controlling the crystal of power ("Fire on the Mountain"), stopping
the Dinobots' rebellion by saving Grimlock ("War of the Dinobots"), defeated Devastator
with his detach arm ("City of Steel"), helped capture Nightbird ("Enter the Nightbird"),
rescued Blaster and Cosmos from the Decepticons on the Moon with the help of Omega Supreme
("Blaster Blues"), and help saved Perceptor and the other Transformers from the cosmic rust
disease ("Cosmic Rust").



Over the course of the next twenty years, the Decepticons succeeded in seizing control of all
of Cybertron, forcing the Autobots to operate from their new city on Earth, and from two bases
on Cybertron's moons. In the Earth year 2005 A.D., Prime was stationed on Moonbase One, and
dispatched troops to Earth to acquire energy for an upcoming strike on Cybertron. The
Decepticons, however, got wind of the plan and used the shuttle run to attack Autobot City; a
distress call summoned Prime and support troops to Earth, and in the fearsome ensuing fight
with Megatron, Optimus Prime sustained fatal injuries, but not before turning the tide of
battle and forcing the Decepticons to flee. Despite the efforts of Perceptor, Optimus Prime
went offline. The Matrix, and with it leadership of the Autobots, fell into the hands of Ultra
Magnus, Galvatron, and subsequently to Rodimus Prime. His last words were " Until that day...
'till all are one. "



Prime's body was entombed in a massive deep-space mausoleum with the many other fallen
Autobots, but his corpse was desecrated by the Quintessons in 2006, when they reanimated it as
part of an attempt to destroy the Autobots by using Prime to lure their space fleet into a trap.
However, the Matrix was able to purify Prime of the Quintesson influence, and he ordered the
other Autobots to clear out while he piloted his flagship into the Quintessons' detonator,
triggering the explosion of a nearby sun. Prime was believed to have been destroyed in the
explosion. According to "The Return of Optimus Prime", Prime's body was recovered from the
craft by two human scientists, Jessica Morgan and Gregory Swofford, just minutes before the
explosion. However, as their ship departed, it was coated with solar spores released by the
explosion of the sun. Jessica's father, Mark Morgan, loathed the Transformers (both Autobot
and Decepticon), and his hatred only grew when an attempt by the Decepticons to steal a
heat-resistant alloy he had developed resulted in Jessica being paralyzed. Swofford and
Morgan reconstructed Optimus Prime's body in an attempt to use it as a delivery system for the
spores, which induced enmity and madness in every sentient being they came into contact with,
in order to destroy the Transformers.



However, when they could not reanimate him, they used his body as a lure instead, bringing the
Autobots to their lab, where they were infected. As this "Hate Plague" proceeded to spread
across the galaxy, Sky Lynx retrieved a Quintesson, who fully restored Optimus Prime to life.
Coating himself in Morgan's heat-resistant alloy, Prime reclaimed the Matrix from Rodimus
and unleashed its concentrated wisdom to destroy the Hate Plague.



In 2007, Prime began to suffer from visions following the release of the Matrix's energy,
which foretold a great transformation for Cybertron. Events began with the Decepticons'
theft of the key to the Plasma Energy Chamber, which forced Prime to consult Alpha Trion within
Vector Sigma, and Prime learned that the mega-computer had orchestrated events in order to
restore Cybertron's Golden Age. When the Plasma Energy Chamber was opened and threatened to
drive Earth's Sun supernova, Spike Witwicky and the Nebulans who had become involved in the
conflict as a result of these events were able to drain off the excess solar energy and
revitalize Cybertron. With the Decepticons driven off Cybertron, and Nebulon free from
tyranny, Cybertron enters into a Golden Age of peace and prosperity under the leadership of
Optimus Prime and the Autobots.



The seldom-seen "5th season" re-airing of the show featured the G1 episodes retold by a
stop-motion Powermaster Optimus Prime to the live-action youngster Tommy Kennedy. No real
back story was ever established for Prime becoming a Powermaster, but the new sequences were
said to take place after the four previous seasons, indicating that in the original Sunbow
continuity at least, Prime became a Powermaster at some point.



Although the animated series ended in the U.S. after The Rebirth , Optimus Prime continued to
appear in animated sequences in the Transformers toy commercials, progressing from
Powermaster to Action Master, and even appearing as a computer-generated Combat Hero
Optimus Prime. Many episodes of the series are re-aired again to promote Transformers:
Generation 2 . During these sequences, computer-generated scenes featuring key
(recolored) G1 characters are borrowed from Generation 2 commercials to serve as an opening,
closing, and commercial bumpers. Optimus Prime is shown in the opening and closing fighting
Generation 2's Ramjet.



While the Transformers animated series came to an end in America with The Rebirth in 1987,
across the Pacific, in Japan, it was decided to continue production of the show with three new,
exclusive animated series (spin-offs) to continue the story. The first of these series,
Transformers: The Headmasters , supplanted the events of The Rebirth , picking up one year
after the events that saw Optimus Prime's return to life. In the beginning of the series it
generally shows Optimus Prime alive again.



In the interim year, with the Decepticons not having been heard from, the Autobots had entered
into an even closer relationship with Earth, and had begun the colonization of other worlds,
the first of which was the planet Athenia, where Optimus Prime was stationed. It soon became
apparent, however, that when Prime had released the energy of the Matrix to cure the Hate
Plague, the consequences were more far-reaching than he had anticipated â€” without
the energy of the Matrix to act as a balancing factor, Vector Sigma had become destabilized,
and the Decepticons suddenly returned to exploit this, assaulting Cybertron in order to
seize control of the mega-computer. Prime took a squad of troops to aid in the battle on the
planet, and when the arrival of the Autobot Headmasters tipped the battle in their favor,
Prime broke off from the main attack and headed down into the depths of the planet, planning on
stabilizing Vector Sigma at any cost.



Guided through the dangers of the planet's catacombs by the spirit of Alpha Trion while the
other Autobots searched for the Matrix on Earth, Prime eventually arrived at the computer,
only to find his way barred by Cyclonus and Scourge. Hot Rod then arrived with the Matrix, with
which Alpha Trion merged, re-energizing it and transforming Hot Rod back into Rodimus Prime;
for the first time, the two Primes fought side-by-side and defeated Galvatron.



Before Rodimus could implement the Matrix to stabilize Vector Sigma, however, Optimus Prime
sacrificed himself to perform the task, merging with the computer and restoring its balance
to save the planet â€” dying again only a few short episodes after his rebirth. The second
of the Japanese-exclusive Transformers series, 1988's Transformers: Super-God
Masterforce did not actually feature Optimus Prime himself, but it did feature one of his
bodies. This series sees human truck driver Ginrai merge with and control a Transtector, a
lifeless Transformer body, which bears a striking resemblance to Optimus Prime. Although
not revealed in the main forty two episodes of the series, an additional clip show episode
produced after the series explained that this was because the body was intended to be used by
Prime, only to be stolen and hidden on Earth by the series antagonist, Devil Z.



Generation 1 Prime makes a cameo in an episode of Transformers: Armada alongside other
characters from the original cartoon.

Convention comics

During Simon Furman's 'Alignment,' a text story available through the British Transformers
convention called 'Transforce,' it is mentioned Prime fell during what was intended to be the
final conflict with the Decepticons at Pinea Omicron, long after the events of the Generation
2 comic book. He managed to defeat Galvatron II but in doing so was damaged such that Grimlock
had to engage a stasis field around him to save his flickering Spark, making Prime a "living war
monument."

Though Prime's ultimate fate is unknown, in a story entitled 'The Last Days of Optimus Prime,'
also from Transforce, Prime laments the new Transformers age without war and it seems he
passes on to a Transformers afterlife referred to as 'J'nwan.' However the story is vague and
may be a metaphor for Prime rejoining the Matrix as his time had come. In this realm, he was
approached by the Predacon Sandstorm, who tried to plead for the help of Prime and the other
legendary Transformers in dealing with a Unicron/Predacon hybrid named Shokaract. Prime
refused, but later led a group of Transformers (including Megatron, Grimlock and Soundwave)
to distract the creature while Primus dealt the killing blow.

Beast Wars

Optimus Primal, leader of the Maximal faction in the Beast Wars animated series and toy line,
is not Optimus Prime â€” Primal is one of the Maximal descendants of the Autobots, who
took the name to honor the Autobot leader. The same applies to the Megatron of this era.
However, before the animated series began, Hasbro did actually envision Prime and Megatron
as their beast counterparts â€” design elements such as Prime's mouth-plate (slitted
to add an actual mouth for the animated series) suggest it, and the first mini-comic that came
packaged with the toys makes it clear. However, once the animated series began, this had
already been changed. Nonetheless, Optimus Prime and Megatron were a major reason the Beast
Wars began. [10]













Megatron attempts to kill Optimus Prime The Beast Wars were waged on prehistoric Earth,
eventually leading to the discovery of the buried Ark . Megatron, following the original
Megatron's instructions in a desperate gambit, decided to attempt to change history by
killing Optimus Prime, who was still lying in The Ark in stasis lock. Megatron hoped that this
would result in the Decepticons winning The Great War and eventually the rule of Cybertron by
the Predacons, the descendants of the Decepticons. Megatron unleashed a full-power weapon
blast at Optimus Prime's face, near-fatally injuring him. However, Optimus Primal
proceeded to take Prime's spark into his body to protect it from surgical trauma while his
injuries were repaired. The subsequent power increase caused by Prime's spark's connection
to the Matrix augmented Primal into the large, transmetal "Optimal Optimus" form with three
alternate modes (jet, land vehicle, and transmetal gorilla). Then, with the repairs
complete, Prime's spark was restored, and he briefly activated before sinking back into
normal stasis. [9 ]

When animating the scene in which Primal removes Prime's spark, Mainframe's animators
consulted The Transformers: The Movie for reference on the interior of Prime's chest.
However, not realizing the importance of the Matrix of Leadership, they rendered it as a
container for Prime's spark. Beast Wars writers Larry DiTillio and Bob Forward have since
claimed that in their view, Prime had not received the Matrix from Alpha Trion at this point,
but a later comic produced for Botcon indicated that the Matrix was in fact stored in a
secondary compartment, hidden behind Prime's spark. In this comic, the alien Vok used the
Matrix, the Transmetal Driver and a control suit once piloted by the Predacon Quickstrike to
create Primal Prime.

Beast Machines

A giant statue of Optimus Prime holding two Golden Disks standing in front of the Cybertron
Archives appeared on Cybertron in the Beast Machines series. The statue was destroyed by the
Vehicons in the episode Fires of the Past . When show writer Bob Skir was asked what these two
disks were he said that neither the statue nor disks were in the script, but he suggested that
they were either the disks from Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes or that Optimus won them in the
2,395,989th Annual Cybertronian spelling bee.

Later in the series Optimus Primal discovered the ancient city of Iacon deep within Cybertron
where he was approached by a hologram statue of Optimus Prime, but it ended up being Megatron in
disguise, who used the opportunity to steal Optimus Primal's access to the Oracle. Obsidian
also comments on how Optimus Primal is not as great a leader as Prime.

[11] [12] War Within Optimus Prime In the 21st century reimagining of the original continuity
by Dreamwave Productions, Optimus Prime started life as Optronix (Orion to his friends), a
data archivist. After taking note of a battle in which the Autobot leader Sentinel Prime had
been killed by Megatron, he was summoned to the Council of Elders and informed that the Matrix
had chosen him to be the next leader of the Autobots. He received the Autobot Matrix of
Leadership shortly thereafter, and almost arranged for the Autobot evacuation of
Cybertron, intending to leave the Decepticons to their own devices, until a battle with
Megatron beneath the planet's surface, accompanied by visions from the Matrix, stirred him
on to fight for the safety of his homeworld. It is interesting to note that in this reimagining,
Optimus actually was physically changed in appearance and size by the Matrix during the
events of the first volume of War Within . [10 ]

Some time into his role as leader, Prime disappeared in a spacebridge experiment along with
Megatron, but returned some time later, having spent a period of time on Quintessa. Events
during this period have gone unrecorded as a result of Dreamwave's closure.



The actual events of the Autobots and Decepticon coming to Earth were never printed by
Dreamwave comics, but flashbacks of the events were seen which suggest evenkening of the
Transformers on Earth, the Autobots allied with humankind and eventually defeated the
Decepticons at the turn of the century. They planned to return to Cybertron aboard the newly
constructed Ark II , but the ship was destroyed as part of a military conspiracy to take control
of the Transformers. However, a terrorist organization run by the enigmatic Lazarus was able
to seize control of several of the Transformers that fell back to Earth, while the U.S.
military located Prime's body. Before his departure, Prime had entrusted a small portion of
the Matrix to Spike Witwicky, who was forced by the product chief, General Hallo, to use it to
reactivate Prime. Functional again, Prime used the Matrix to reactivate more of his fallen
comrades, and then faced off against Megatron in San Francisco.



Following this, Prime began to experience subconscious urgings, leading both the Autobots
and the Decepticons to the Arctic Circle, where Shockwave arrived to greet them â€” and
arrest them as war criminals. Shockwave had succeeded in ending the war on Cybertron, but
Prime soon fell in with a rebel Autobot group that had discovered Shockwave had greater
agenda. Rallying Transformers across Cybertron to the cause, Prime faced Shockwave in
battle but was defeated and had the Matrix ripped from him and used to activate Vector Sigma.
Before Shockwave could make full use of the mega-computer's data, however, Ultra Magnus (in
this continuity, Prime's brother) arrived and bested him. The injuries Prime took in this
conflicted necessitated a prolonged restoration period in stasis but Dreamwave's closure
meant that Prime never appeared in their pages again.



Art from unreleased issues later showed Optimus Prime awakening from the cryo regeneration
chamber and freeing Alpha Trion from Shockwave's lab.



Prime would make one further surprise appearance in Dreamwave's Transformers: Armada comic
series, although it would not be the Prime of the Dreamwave first series. When the Optimus
Prime of the Armada universe disappeared, pulled into another dimension by the power of
Unicron, the Chaos-Bringer sent something back in his stead â€” a nearly dead Optimus
Prime from that universe, who warned the Transformers of Unicron's coming into their
universe before dying.

[13] [14] Optimus Prime as a Cobra Sentry Missile System Optimus Prime would also be a major
character in Devil's Due Publishing's various G.I. Joe meets the Transformers series.
Little is known about this Prime's early years, save that he survived an assassination
attempt by Bludgeon soon after receiving the Matrix. From this point the traditional Ark
storyline would leave the Transformers crashed on Earth. However, here they were not
reactivated of their own accord: The Ark was discovered by the terrorist organization Cobra,
and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by
the Televipers. Prime was turned into a Cobra Sentry Missile System tank (a 1985 Sears store
exclusive red repaint of the HISS tank). [11 ] After an attack on a U.N. summit in Washington
D.C. he was, however, able to get a message to Wheeljack, alerting G.I. Joe to where the Cobra
base was hidden. Subsequently he and the other captive Autobots (and Decepticons) broke
free, and he battled and defeated his enemy Megatron. The Transformers then returned to
Cybertron in a second Ark Class vessel, but not before gifting their human allies with a
surprising technological boon: The ability to build and usemecha based on Transformers
technology.

Sadly, Prime's homecoming was not all he had hoped for: the Decepticon Shockwave had taken
control of the planet. Prime and the other Transformers were forced to go underground, waging
a guerrilla war against the Decepticons. Around this time Cobra would attempt to steal
Teletran-3, but their attempt to teleport directly into the chamber would set off a
catastrophic malfunction, one that threatened to crack open time itself. Optimus Prime and
the Stunticons were amongst those who found themselves sent back in time. He was reformatted
into a 1920s semi-truck. He was eventually rescued by Roadblock, Beach Head and the Baroness
and helped to capture the Stunticons.



In the wake of this incident the Transformers managed to reclaim much of Cybertron. Mindful of
the dangers of allowing humans like Cobra access to Cybertronian technology, Prime sent
Perceptor, Grimlock, Arcee and Bumblebee on a mission to Earth. As it turned out Prime's fears
were well founded: the U.S. government had used parts from Megatron to create Serpent O.R., a
cyborg designed to be a perfect weapon. A raid by Cobra allowed it to escape and gather an army of
Decepticons on Cybertron, killing Bumblebee in the process. Despite the grief of losing
Bumblebee, Prime continued on and rallied his comrades to do the same. Attacking the Autobot
capital city, Serpentor's forces proved overwhelming, and Prime voluntarily to surrender
to ensure the Decepticons would cease fire. Realizing Serpentor wanted the Autobot Matrix of
Leadership, Prime broke free as Serpentor was distracted, but was unable to kill him,
promptly being attacked and beaten near death by Razorclaw and Motormaster. He was
subsequently forced to watch as Serpentor opened the Matrix. The result was not what anyone
expected â€” Serpentor was not only reformatted into a Transformers-size mechanoid
but was shown the futility of the fighting by the Matrix. At this point Cobra Commander was able
to take control of Serpentor's body, only being defeated by Hawk opening the Matrix,
transforming him into a great leader and rendering Cobra Commander comatose. As the Joes
prepared to head home, Prime promised to record the Hawk-led humans' future.



Prime appeared again in the fourth crossover 'Black Horizon'. With the Matrix afflicted Hawk
receiving dire visions of a new threat, Prime journeyed to Earth personally, taking Hawk
andFlint to Tibet to discover the source of the problem â€” only to encounter Bludgeon
once again. The two battled, with Prime only being saved by Hawk's intervention. Fighting
their way into a secret city beneath the Himalayas, the trio realized the extent of the threat
â€” the impending destruction of humanity by Unicron, and the world being taken over by
Cobra-La. However at that point they were discovered by Bludgeon and a group of Cobra-La
troops. Prime defeated Bludgeon, although the warrior plummeted to his death despite
Prime's best efforts. Prime, Hawk and Joe Colton (the original G.I. Joe) then gatecrashed the
Cobra-La ceremony to sacrifice Firewall to Unicron in Prime's truck mode. Prime was then
mobbed by Cobra-La warriors, and pinned down by a monstrous insectoid creature. Prime
demolished them in time to save Hawk from Golobulus. With Cobra-La arrested by G.I. Joe, Prime
checked his troops would recover â€” and then sat down to watch TV with Eject and
Firewall.



In the third series both Prime and Serpentor indicate that the Matrix had transformed Prime
from " a simple archivist " into a great warrior, indicating that the history of this
incarnation of Prime is roughly in line with that of the Dreamwave version.

[15] [16] Cybertronian Optimus Prime and Springer When IDW Publishing received the comic
rights to The Transformers , author Simon Furman was hired to oversee the line. Furman decided
that the Generation 1 continuity "was in need of ... a contemporary restart" so that the comic
could retain a modern audience. [12 ] Furman's revised continuity establishes Optimus Prime
as the present-day leader of an Autobot army spread across the galaxy in small units, waging a
covert war against teams of Decepticon infiltrators over resource-rich worlds. The
Stormbringer miniseries explains that the Transformer homeworld of Cybertron is a dead
planet, ravaged by an ancient cataclysm caused by the Autobot-Decepticon War, one which
forced Prime to ally with his arch-rival Megatron to eventually halt. In the series, the
interference of Jetfire and the Technobots in a plot organized by the Decepticon Bludgeon
alerts Prime to the possibility that the Cybertronian cataclysm might be re-ignited and
spread to other planets. Prime calls in the Wreckers , meeting them on the surface of Cybertron
in time to witness the return of the being called Thunderwing , the focal point of the
apocalypse. The combined efforts of Prime, the Wreckers, Jetfire, Predacon -led
Decepticons and a unit of aging Centurion drones are barely enough to render Thunderwing
inert.

Bludgeon's recovered files bring Optimus Prime to Earth, where an Autobot detachment led by
Prowl has discovered that a Decepticon infiltration unit led by Starscream has broken
standard protocol after discovering a new form of Energon. This Ore-13 appears to be the same
"Ultra-Energon" that Bludgeon used to restore Thunderwing, dormant for millennia after the
apocalypse, to life, and Starscream has already used it to fuel a failed attempt to usurp
Megatron's leadership (as detailed in the Infiltration miniseries).



In the Escalation miniseries, Megatron himself engages Prime and, boosted by Ore-13,
overcomes him. Believing their leader dead, the rest of the Autobots attempt to buy the
newly-arrived Hot Rod time to collect the clone, but Prime â€” who has transferred his
consciousness to a backup memory in his trailer command post â€” advises them to exploit
Ore-13's weakness and assault Megatron all-out, catalyzing the Decepticon leader's
Energon supply and crippling him.

Edit



This Japanese series, told through radio plays, and using the Transformers: Alternators (
Binaltech in Japan) Optimus Prime toy mold (see "Toys"), branches off from the original
animated series, and is set in a different universe than the both the original G1 and Binaltech
continuities. Set in the year 2006 (which, in Japanese continuity, is one year after Prime's
death in The Transformers: The Movie , but four years before the third season), it sees Prime's
corpse covertly transported to Japan by the government organization, the Earth Defense
Command . The convoy transporting his body was then attacked by a group of female commandos,
led by Marissa Faireborn , who had known Prime years ago as a child. Believing they had secured
Prime's body, the commandos were taken by surprise by EDC "Kiss Player" operative Ringo and
her Autrooper mechanoid partner, who killed them all except Marissa. Marissa went to Prime's
body, just as an Autrooper began to fuse with it; reflecting on her childhood memories of
Prime, she gave his faceplate a final kiss, which initiated an amazing transformation
â€” Marissa and Prime were fused together, and Prime was reborn with a new body, now
transforming into a Dodge Ram SRT-10.



Marissa and Prime are now on the run from the EDC, and are also frequently opposed by the
mysterious "Legion" Transformers. Faced with such foes, Marissa unleashes her "Kiss
Player" ability by kissing Prime, fusing with him once again, and increasing his power so that
he can best their opponents. Prime is armed with the "Surf Blade," a weapon formed out of
Marissa's surfboard, wielded expertly thanks to the knife skills Marissa passes on to him
when they merge. [14 ]



[ edit ]Binaltech

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



Due to the interference of Ravage (the same future Ravage who appears in the Beast Wars ), most
of the events of the original animated feature do not transpire; most importantly the Battle
of Autobot City does not occur, and Optimus Prime and Megatron do not have their final
showdown, meaning that Optimus Prime does not die, and Megatron is never reformatted into
Galvatron. As a result, Optimus Prime is present to lead the Transformers during the
Binaltech saga.



Equipped with knowledge of the future and the danger that would soon be threatening the
Transformers, Ravage's machinations included trapping Megatron and a large army of
Decepticons in a spacial rift, with the intention of protecting the Decepticons from the
approaching Unicron , and forcing the Autobots to face the planet-eater unaided. The
Decepticons would then be in a position to conquer whoever was the victor of that battle.



Aware of the changes to the timestream, as well as the potential for the entire Autobot race to
be annihilated by Unicron, Optimus put into motion Operation Distant Thunder, a plan to undo
the damage to the timeline caused by Ravage, restoring the events that were seen in the movie.
In a damned-if-they-do, damned-if-they-don't situation, it would mean that saving all the
Autobots from Unicron would result in Prime and others such as Prowl, Wheeljack, Ironhide and
Ratchet still dying per the original events. But it was hoped they may be able to at least partly
avoid such an outcome by sending a "ship in a bottle" back in time â€” a message to their
past selves about all they had learned.



Upon discovering that the Matrix was the key to destroying Unicron, Optimus Prime and Ultra
Magnus went on alone to face Unicron, while the rest of the Autobots executed the plan to
restore the original timeline, Operation Distant Thunder. It was hoped that at least one of
these plans would be successful. Prime was injured in the confrontation with Unicron, and
although his injuries were not mortal, he passed the Matrix to Magnus, who shed his outer armor
and managed to successfully complete the mission, resulting in the destruction of Unicron.



Distant Thunder was ultimately unsuccessful, however as the universe started to rip apart, a
black Optimus Prime clone appeared, splitting the Binaltech universe into its own separate
continuity, while also restoring the original timeline and stabilizing the multiverse. The
clone, obviously friendly to the Transformers, proclaimed that the Binaltech universe must
be allowed to continue, as it was important to the future. Optimus Prime questioned the black
doppelganger, who explained only that he carried "the Protector's" spark, but refused to
reveal any more detailed information than that. Soon after however, the clone, who was
originally developed by Dr Archeville as a weapon of evil, ejected the "good" spark that had
invaded and taken over the black figure, reverted to its original evil programming and, now no
longer just a black version of Optimus but the malevolent Nemesis Prime (Black Convoy),
escaped.



Per Ravage's original plan, with Unicron defeated, the Decepticons returned to conquer the
Transformers. However, Optimus Prime also planned for this event, and sent Mirage to press a
switch, buried deep within Cybertron, that would render all Transformers inert. (This was
seen at the conclusion of the "Five Faces of Darkness" story arc from the original animated
series.) Optimus hoped that although all the Transformers would be rendered inoperative,
the war would be stopped, and that the humans would be able to reactivate the Transformers in
the future. However, this plan had the surprising side-effect that only those with original
Cybertronian bodies were deactivated â€” those with Earth-made Binaltech bodies
continued to function. And thus, the Autobots effectively won the war, with the large army of
Binaltech Autobots easily outnumbering the few Decepticons who had managed to procure
Binaltech upgrades (effectively just Nemesis Prime and Shockwave, who escaped with
Megatron and their other inert comrades).



With the major threats taken care of, Optimus Prime turned his and the Autobots' attention to
identifying and shutting down the rogue projects taking place across Earth using stolen
Binaltech technology and secrets. It was during one of these missions that Optimus Prime
faced off against Nemesis Prime, with both of them in Binaltech Dodge Ram forms. Initially,
things looked bad for Optimus Prime, as he was no match for his opponent's spectral armor.
However, the Protector merged with Prime, and the enormous power that resulted allowed Prime
to reflect Nemesis Prime's final attack, obliterating the evil Decepticon. Optimus Prime
recalls the union of the two sparks being familiar, from an event in the distant past, and is
also reassured by the Protector about "the seeds of the future", revealing the Protector to be
Optimus Primal . [15 ]

Through the years, there have been many action figures representing the original
incarnation of Optimus Prime, some of which have featured in fiction, others of which have
not.

    

    - Generation 1 Optimus Prime (1984)

    

    

        The original Optimus Prime toy, with Combat Deck and Roller. Originally part of
        Takara 's 1983 Diaclone line under the name "Battle Convoy," the figure was designed
        by Hiroyuki Obara and Shoji Kawamori . [16 ] The figure's definitive mouth-plate has
        become a design element in most incarnations and variants of Optimus Prime down the
        years, let alone for a few exceptions, noted individually following. Integrated
        into the first year of the Transformers toy line, the toy was given its new name,
        Optimus Prime, by comic book writer/editor Dennis O'Neil . His removable fists are
        one of the most easily-lost parts of the figure, and have proven to be a step in
        transformation that future toys based on this body have striven to eliminate.
        Roller was included in many colors, including silver (matching his trailer),
        indigo (matching his fists and legs), and blue (matching the trailer legs on a unique
        variant).

    

        A special promotional version of the figure was released in 1985, with a Pepsi
        sticker on the trailer. In Japan, the toy was released again twice within the
        original line, in multi-figure packs, both times with blue windows to more closely
        represent the cartoon.

    

        The toy was reissued in Japan in 2000 in its original incarnation, but with Roller
        molded in indigo, covered in silver paint. At the same time, it was recolored almost
        entirely in black as an exclusive for the JAFCON convention. The toy was reissued
        again in Japan for New Year's Day in 2002 with blue windows, sky blue eyes (inspired by
        the cartoon), a die-cast Matrix accessory. It was reissued again in 2003 with a new
        energy axe accessory. Reissued in the West by Hasbro in 2002, the toy had to be
        modified for safety reasons, and features shorter smokestacks and longer
        missiles, as well as having Roller's spring-loaded launcher deactivated.

    

        As a Diaclone mold, the toy features an opening "cockpit" in his chest where two
        Diaclone drivers can sit. Diaclone drivers can also sit in the cockpit of the missile
        launcher, as well as in Roller's 4 seats. The Matrix accessory which shipped with
        Galaxy Force/Cybertron Optimus Prime fits perfectly inside this compartment.

    

        The cab of the toy was later redecorated into the cab of Ultra Magnus and Pepsi Convoy .

    

    

    - Generation 1 Decoy Optimus Prime (1986)

    

    

        A small, red rubber model of Optimus Prime, part of a large number of similar figures
        of other Transformers that were packaged as promotional items with figures in the
        1986-87 toy line.

    

    

    - Generation 1 Powermaster Optimus Prime (1988)

    

    

        Two years after his original toy left store shelves after his "death" in The
        Transformers: The Movie in 1986, Optimus Prime was restored to life as part of the new
        Powermaster sub-group. As before, he transforms into a red truck cab with a grey
        trailer, and when his PowerMaster engine parter Hi-Q is plugged into place, the cab
        becomes a robot, while the trailer transforms into a battle station. The major new
        feature of the toy, however, is the ability of the cab and trailer to combine together
        to form a giant "super robot" version of Optimus Prime.

    

        The head for the super robot is a separate piece which must be attached, and the
        original design for the toy was to have this be an upgraded Roller, who would
        transform from buggy, to robot, to head. This did not come to pass, however, and the
        head is left to sit separately with no function in any other mode (although it can be
        stored in the trailer in truck mode).

    

        Another version of Powermaster Prime was released in Japan the same year and given
        the separate identity Ginrai . While the American version of his cab is made of
        plastic with decals for windows, Ginrai's cab was cast in die-cast metal, with
        translucent plastic windows. His smokestacks were shortened and chromed, his
        small robot mode's eyes were painted sky blue, and the plastic used for his trailer
        and shoulder weapons was molded in a silver or metallic gray. In addition, the arms
        for Super Ginrai had retractable blue fists, as opposed to Optimus Prime's solid red
        arms. Ginrai, called Super Ginrai when combined with his trailer, was sold together
        and separately with a tandem trailer named Godbomber which turned into an
        additional robot, as well as combined with Super Ginrai to form a larger robot .
        Ginrai was reissued in Japan in 2001, in both his original color scheme, a red and
        orange "Fire Guts" eHobby exclusive, and in black as "Nucleon Quest Convoy." This
        reissue, in its original colors, was later released by Hasbro, branded as
        Powermaster Optimus Prime (the name of its American counterpart), with Godbomber
        renamed Apex Bomber.

    

    

    - Generation 1 Action Master Optimus Prime (1990)

    

    

        Part of the new sub-line of Transformers figures which did not actually transform,
        Action Master Optimus Prime is a poseable action figure resembling a composite of
        the original toy and his animated appearance. The Action Masters' articulation was
        based in part on that of 3ÂŸ" G.I. Joe figures. Instead of transforming himself, he
        came packaged with the "Armored Convoy," a large truck which could transform into a
        battle station and an aircraft. This body was the basis for the new form the Last
        Autobot reconfigured Hi-Q/Prime into at the conclusion of the original U.S. Marvel
        Comics series.

    

        In 2000 Takara released L-20 Micro Trailer with Secret Breaster Pilot Edison in
        Japan, which was a recolor of Optimus Prime's Armored Convoy truck in green and
        white, with a Microman pilot named Edison.

    

    

    - Generation 1 Star Convoy (1992)

    

    

        A Japanese-exclusive from the final year of the toy line, Star Convoy is the reborn
        form of Optimus Prime, and comes with a Micromaster version of Hot Rod . He transforms
        from a truck into a robot (without the usual cab/trailer separation), and can also
        become a battle station for Micromasters. His electronic "Tread Unit," apparently
        a new form for Roller, allows him to roll forward or backward in vehicle or robot mode,
        and becomes a conveyor to roll out Micromasters in base mode. These electronics can
        also be linked with Star Convoy's fellow Autobot Grandus, to operate that toy's
        base-mode elevator. A third Autobot, Sky Garry, can also connect in base mode, and
        the three can link up in vehicle mode, with Grandus hitched to the rear of Star Convoy,
        and Sky Garry atop him, in a combination called the "Battlestars."

    

        Star Convoy was reissued in Japan in 2005, his white parts replaced with metallic
        silver, and his yellow chest cross in chromed gold.

    

    

    - Generation 2 Optimus Prime (1993)

    

    

        A redecorated and slightly remolded version of the original Optimus Prime toy, this
        is the form to which Prime is returned at the beginning of Marvel's Generation 2
        comic. With his trailer now black instead of gray, Prime is also equipped with an
        electronic sound box which emits various laser noises, and the phrase " I am Optimus
        Prime! " Two firing missile launchers can plug into the side of this box, which can be
        wielded in Prime's robot fists, while the box itself mounts either on the front of the
        trailer, or on Prime's back.

    

    

    - Generation 2 Combat Hero Optimus Prime (1994)

    

    

        This new figure's primary feature was a bellows-operated cannon; by slamming your
        hand down on the small plastic bellows attached to the toy by a hose, a jet of air
        blasted a rubber-tipped missile through the air. This figure is the form into which
        the Swarm reconfigured Prime at the conclusion of Marvel's Generation 2 comics,
        although there, it was rendered with his traditional color scheme, instead of the
        toy's more novel one. Prototypes of Combat Hero Optimus Prime in dark blue were made,
        but the toy was never sold in that color.

    

        Hero Prime was released in Europe as a different character named "Sureshot,"
        changing the chest stickers which displayed Optimus's name. The toy was later
        redecorated in black, gray and teal and released as Destructicon Scourge for the
        Transformers: Robots in Disguise line in 2002.

    

    

    - Generation 2 Laser Optimus Prime (1995)

    

    

        Part of the "Laser Rod" sub-group of 1995 (hence leading him to often be incorrectly
        referred to as "Laser Rod Optimus Prime"), this incarnation of Prime had a light-up
        electronic fist which illuminated his clear plastic sword, and light-up heads for
        his tanker truck vehicle mode. In traditional fashion, the cab became Prime himself
        while the trailer transformed with spring-loaded action into a very heavily armed
        battle station with missile launcher, disk launcher and bellows-operated cannon.
        Highly poseable for the time, this toy was for a long period viewed as one of the best
        Transformers toys created.

    

        Laser Prime was later redecorated in black, gray and teal as Black Convoy for
        Takara's 2000 Car Robots line, who was then in turn imported and turned into Scourge
        for Transformers: Robots in Disguise in 2001. In 2006, the figure was redecorated
        again into the Japanese eHobby exclusive, Laser Ultra Magnus .

    

    

    - Generation 2 Go-Bot Optimus Prime (1995)

    

    

        As part of the large sub-line of free-wheeling, simplistic "Go-Bots," this was an
        unusual Optimus Prime figure, a redecoration of an earlier figure named
        Firecracker which transformed into a red Lamborghini Diablo. Go-Bot Prime was the
        first Optimus Prime figure to lack the character's distinctive mouth plate, but was
        the first Optimus Prime to score a perfect set of 10s in his tech spec numbers.
        Additionally, the toy's tech spec gave an explanation for the large number of bodies
        Prime had been going through during the Generation 2 toy line, crediting an
        "Internal Reconfiguration Matrix" with the transformations. The US version of the
        toy came with no Autobot symbol and a plain chest, whereas the Japanese version has a
        blue Transformers logo on it.

    

    

    - Generation 2 General Optimus Prime (unreleased)

    

    

        There were plans and prototypes to release a toy called General Optimus Prime, a
        re-coloration of a Decepticon Autoroller in white and gray camouflage deco, but the
        toy was never released. The figure could be seen, along with Sgt. Hound , and Road
        Block and Dirtbag, in a picture from the 1995 Hasbro Toy Fair Boy's Toys Catalog. It
        appears that the repaints are incorrectly listed, because of the colors of the two
        figures. [17 ]

    



    [17] [18] Optimus Primal, the "new" form of Optimus Prime?* Beast Wars Basic Optimus
    Primal (1996)

        Although the later storyline of Beast Wars would go on to depict Optimus Primal as a
        different character than Optimus Prime, the comic which shipped with the original
        Beast Wars toy versions of Optimus Primal and Megatron depicted them as new
        incarnations of Optimus Prime and Megatron. Presumably these forms â€”
        Primal as a bat, Megatron as a crocodile â€” were their new bodies after
        Generation 2.

    

        This toy was redecorated into the BotCon 1996 exclusive toy, the black and gray Onyx
        Primal , and the Japanese-exclusive Convobat, in traditional red and blue Prime
        colors.

    

    

    - Machine Wars Optimus Prime (1997)

    

    

        The short-lived Machine Wars toy line from Hasbro featured an Optimus Prime figure
        that was a recolored version of Thunderclash , a 1992 Turbomaster â€” part of a
        line of Transformers exclusive to Europe , Australia and New Zealand . Thunderclash
        was not well-suited to the job, given that he was a truck with a cab that became a robot
        and a trailer that became battle station. As a repaint of an existing character, this
        incarnation of Prime also lacked the characteristic mouth-plate, although the
        toy's box art depicted him with one, being as it was retooled art from Laser Optimus
        Prime's packaging. He continued the trend of perfect 10s in his tech specs, but was
        for a long period regarded as one of the worst Prime toys, not because the toy itself
        was bad by some fans, but because it was visibly un-Prime-like.

    

    

    - Smallest Transformers Optimus Prime (2003)

    

    

        A miniature, two-inch-high version of the original Optimus Prime figure sold in the
        first wave of the blind-packaged " Smallest Transformers " series (often
        incorrectly called "World's Smallest Transformers," or "WSTF"). His trailer was
        available separately, and the figure was later recolored into a cartoon-based
        paint job for another release in 2004, alongside a white version of the figure,
        dubbed "White Mode," but clearly a reference to the shared mold of the original toy
        and Ultra Magnus.

    

    

    - 20th Anniversary Optimus Prime, with Megatron (2004)

    

    

        Released in 2004 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Transformers franchise,
        this 12" tall, 3 pound version of Optimus Prime strove to reproduce his cartoon
        appearance in the most intricate detail, going so far as to feature a particularly
        complex torso transformation in the name of featuring a different design of grill
        for truck and robot modes. Featuring several die-cast metal parts, working
        suspension with rubber tires, a removable light-up Matrix of Leadership and
        flip-up wrist communicators, with Bumblebee and Starscream, this
        highly-poseable Prime was armed with his traditional ion blaster (originally
        released in grey, later amended to the correct black), his energon axe, and even a
        gun-mode Megatron with stock, scope and silencer.

    

        This toy was featured on page 18 of the book Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The
        Future by Erin Brereton published by Triumph Books .

    

        In Japan, the toy was released as "Masterpiece Convoy," and was able to feature
        longer smokestacks because of different safety regulations. The Japanese version
        of the toy also lacked the painted "battle damage" scorch marks. The packaging could
        be folded up to create a cardboard trailer to hitch up to the back of the cab. Takara
        held a mail in contest where ten people won gold plated versions of this toy [18 ] and
        they later redecorated the figure in white in 2005 as "Masterpiece Ultra Magnus."

    

        In honor of the 20th anniversary of The Transformers: The Movie , this figure has been
        re-released with a new electronic display base which speaks re-recorded phrases
        from the film. The new release of this figure is in the cartoon-correct colors,
        without the "battle damage" scorch marks from the 2004 version.

    

    

    - Universe Spy Changer Optimus Prime

    

    

        A repaint of the Spy Changer Scourge from the Robots in Disguise line, painted to
        resemble the original Optimus Prime. Two packaging versions of this toy existed
        â€” a Kaybee version which did not attribute the toy to Universe and was
        packaged in vehicle form, and a version for discount stores which did and was
        packaged in robot mode. His function is Leader and his motto is "Freedom is the right
        of all sentient beings." Dedicated to protecting all life, Optimus Prime leads the
        Transformers in unceasing battle against the evil Decepticons. His courage and
        wisdom know no bounds, and he is respected throughout the universe as a powerful
        champion of peace. Carries a blaster rifle as well as the ancient Autobot Matrix of
        Leadership.

    

    

    - Robot Masters G1 Convoy (2004)

    

    

        The Japanese Transformers: Robot Masters toy line naturally featured a new toy of
        Prime, here referred to as G1 Convoy in order to distinguish him from the
        also-appearing Optimus Primal, also called Convoy in Japan, and here equipped with
        the qualifier of "Beast Convoy." Designed to look like a small version of the 20th
        Anniversary figure, the Robot Masters incarnation of Prime featured an overly
        simplistic transformation that resulted in an unimpressive truck mode, but came
        with his gun and axe. The figure was redecorated in black as a Dangeki Hobby exclusive
        in 2005.

    

    

    - Generation 1 Orion Pax and Barrelroller (2005)

    

    

        A redecoration of the 2005 reissue of Kup as Orion Pax, available exclusively
        through the Japanese online retailer, eHobby. Kup's Targetmaster partner Recoil
        was included as Barrelroller, a droid who transformed into a loading tool, intended
        as an earlier form of Roller.

    

    

    - Alternators Optimus Prime (2006)

    

    

        Originally, Hasbro intended for the Dodge Ram toy they had created for the licensed
        vehicle line, Transformers: Alternators to be a different character, but Takara
        insisted on the toy's identity as Optimus Prime, as pick-up trucks are an uncommon
        sight on Japanese roads, and Prime's character would help to sell the toy. This toy
        features a vanity license plate featuring the Autobot logo and the word "PRIME".
        Although it stylistically resembles the California license plate, Optimus
        Prime's plate identifies him as being registered in "Cybertron".

    

        This toy was featured on page 7 of the book Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The
        Future by Erin Brereton published by Triumph Books .

    

        Oddly, however, when originally solicited, the Japanese version of the toy (the
        line known there as "Binaltech") was named Ginrai, after the Prime lookalike from
        Masterforce , but this solicitation was cancelled. When it appeared again, as part
        of the "Binaltech Aterisk" line â€” which featured small PVC figures of girls
        that could ride in the vehicles â€” it was as "Black Convoy." This too vanished,
        and Prime was finally released as himself, with different paint applications, in
        the "Kiss Players" line, with Marissa Faireborn, though on the box her name is listed
        as Melissa.

    

        Alternators Prime was redecorated into Nemesis Prime for the 2006 San Diego Comic
        Con. Only 3000 of these were produced, and are highly sought after by collectors. It
        was also redecorated into Binaltech Black Convoy for Wonder Festival 2007 and
        released in even fewer numbers, regularly selling for more than US$200. Black
        Convoy was the only version of the Optimus Prime Dodge Ram mold featuring diecast
        components, until BT-22 Convoy was released in October 2008.

    

    

    - Hybrid Style Optimus Prime (2006)

    

    

        Better known by its obtuse Japanese classification of "T.H.S.-02 Convoy", this
        version of Prime, based on his original form, follows on from T.H.S.-01, a highly
        poseable version of Transformers: Cybertron Optimus Prime . Redesigned by noted
        mecha creator Shoji Kawamori of Macross fame, this Prime included die-cast metal
        parts and interchangeable hands including his energy axe, rifle, Matrix and a
        replica of the jetpack from the episode Dinobot Island Part 2 . As with the original
        figure, the trailer opened into a battle station, and came with Roller. The toy has
        divided opinions among collectors, praised for its high level of articulation and
        innovative new ways to represent Prime's classic transformation, but likewise
        derided for its lackluster truck mode, looking like nothing so much as Prime's torso
        balanced on a set of wheels.

    

    

    - Titanium 6 inch War Within Optimus Prime (2006)

    

    

        Based on Optimus Prime's Cybertronian mode from Dreamwave's Transformers: The War
        Within comic book series, this transforming figure is part of the 6" "Cybertron
        Heroes" size class of Transformers Titanium Series figures. This figure was
        initially released by itself, and later in a Toys-R-us exclusive 2-pack with War
        Within Megatron. A repaint of this figure in white as Ultra Magnus was announced by
        Botcon 2006.

    

    

    - Titanium 3 inch War Within Optimus Prime (2006)

    

    

        Based on Optimus Prime's Cybertronian mode from Dreamwave's Transformers: The War
        Within comic book series, this non-transforming figure is part of the 3" "Robot
        Masters" size class of Transformers Titanium Series figures.

    

    

    - Titanium 3 inch Optimus Prime (2006)

    

    

        Based on Optimus Prime's original form, but actually his 20th
        Anniversary/Masterpiece figure, this non-transforming figure is part of the 3"
        "Robot Masters" size class of Transformers Titanium Series figures.

    



    [19] [20] Classic Voyager Optimus Prime* Classics Voyager Optimus Prime (2006)

        Intended to update classic characters into modern forms, Transformers: Classics
        included in its first wave a new version of Optimus Prime, who once again transforms
        into a red COE truck cab, though modernized and more aerodynamic than the original.
        This Optimus Prime does not have a trailer, and the attachment point for one is
        awkwardly rectangular. The exhaust stacks convert into a laser cannon with the
        appearance of two Submachine guns grouped side-by-side, though they are not
        intended to be separated. The air deflector atop the cab converts into an Ion
        Blaster. Connecting the exhaust stacks to the air deflector makes it into dual
        shoulder cannons.

    

        This toy was featured on page 16 of the book Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The
        Future by Erin Brereton published by Triumph Books .

    

        This figure was redecorated in white and blue as Ultra Magnus, sold in a two-pack with
        Skywarp .

    

        A later released 2-pack included Classic Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.

    

        This toy was featured in bus stop add for Hill Side Mall in Canada.

    

        This figure was released a third time, in black and teal colors, for the 2007 Comic Con
        as Nemesis Prime, under the Transformers Universe line. He is Voyager Class. [19 ]

    

    

    - Classic Ultimate Battle Optimus Prime vs. Megatron (2006)

    

    

        Part of the Classics line. This toy is Deluxe sized and is made in the style of his
        original toy, but with " Power punch action! ". Also includes an Ultimate Battle
        Megatron and a DVD narrated by Optimus Prime. The disk features a photo gallery slide
        show with photos of the wave 1-2 Classics figures. It also features 22 minutes of
        clips starting with the Cybertron theme song over a montage of various Cybertron
        scenes and a story of who the Transformers are, what they can do, what Mini-Cons and
        Planet Keys are, etc.

    

        Later releases of this pack included two random bonus Mini-Cons chosen from
        Cybertron Longarm , Overcast and Deepdive .

    

        In late 2007 this set was repackaged in Transformers: Universe packing without the
        DVD available at Dollar General stores.

    

    

    - MP-04 Complete Masterpiece Convoy (2006)

    

    

        The figure is essentially the same as the original MP-01 but comes with the addition
        of a proper detailed plastic trailer. The trailer unfolds into a repair bay/mobile
        base and can hold a single Alternators figure while closed. Most Alternators
        figures can be accommodated, with the exception of the Ford Mustang and Dodge Ram
        molds. Another change are the images on the arm comlinks, which now show Megatron and
        Grimlock on the left and right wrists, respectively. However, to many a fan's
        chagrin, a Roller figure was not included.

    

    

    - Revoltech Convoy

    

    

        Based on, what primarily seems to be, Pat Lee's interpretation of Optimus Prime from
        the Dreamwave comic series, Revoltech Convoy is the 19th of the Revoltech line,
        using the key Revolver Joint which gives the figure incredible poseability for
        numerous dynamic poses. The figure included three optional hands apart from the
        regular clenched fists, including a right hand to hold the gun or to give a "Come
        hither" finger movement, a pointing right hand, and an open left hand used to hold the
        Matrix or for more choices in posing. Accessories include Prime's characteristic
        rifle, with the handle held to the main cannon by a peg to enable it to rotate, and the
        Matrix which cannot be held in the fists or put into the chest but can be held with the
        aforementioned open hand. However, this is a purely display figure and although it
        does bear the Transformers name it does not actually transform.

    

    

    - Attacktix Optimus Prime (2007)

    

    

        Part of a 4 pack starter set for Attacktix, Optimus comes with the original Megatron,
        Energon Landquake and San Diego ComicCon inspired Skywarp .

    

    

    - Classic Pepsi Optimus Prime (2007)

    

    

        A prize in the Mountain Dew -sponsored "Transform Your Summer" contest, Pepsi
        Optimus Prime is, for all practical purposes, nearly identical to Pepsi Convoy , but
        packaged in an English-language box that identifies him as the original Prime and
        having shorted mufflers on the arms (for U.S. toy safety laws). He was later sold at
        BotCon 2007 and then on the Hasbro Toy Shop web site. His package style places him with
        the Classic line, although it does not specifically mention the Classics in the
        text.

    

    

    - Softimus Prime (2007)

    

    

        A plush doll version of Optimus Prime that transforms into truck mode by simply
        folding the upper body inside out. [20 ]

    

    

    - Optimash Prime (2007)

    

    

        A Mr. Potato Head doll with parts and accessories to dress him up like Optimus Prime.
        Also includes a mini Optimus Prime truck. [21 ]

    

    

    - Convoy feat. Nike Free 7.0 (2007)

    

    

        A special collaboration with Nike and Takara Tomy called "Transformers: Sports
        Label" features both Optimus Prime and Megatron with the ability to transform into
        life sized versions the "Nike Free 7.0" shoe. Optimus' shoe form is colored white,
        red, and black but manages to retains his classic red, blue, white colors in robot
        form. Keeping with the shoe theme, he is come packaged in a Nike shoebox and his feet
        are patterned after the very shoe he transforms into. [22 ]

    

        This figure would be redecoed into Ultra Magnus , with the shoe colored white, black,
        and yellow and the robot with the standard white and royal blue. [23 ]

    

    

    - BT-22 Convoy feat. Dodge Ram SRT-10 (2008)

    

    

        The third use of the Dodge Ram mold to represent Optimus Prime, the first being
        Alternators Optimus Prime and the second being Kiss Players Convoy, this is also the
        only version of him which features diecast components, and the only diecast
        incarnation of this mold which was sold as a general release (the first diecast Dodge
        Ram, representing Black Convoy, was an exclusive). The figure includes the same
        amount of diecast in the same places as Black Convoy, and while based on the deco for
        Kiss Players Convoy, also includes elements from Alternators Optimus Prime, such
        as red arms and blue eyes. The figure came in traditional Binaltech packaging,
        however the box is scaled up somewhat to accommodate the figure's larger size. Like
        the other late-run Binaltech figures (Bluestreak, Argent Meister and Arcee),
        Convoy does not include the trading card or glossy booklet found in most earlier
        Binaltech figures.

    

    

    - Universe Generation 1 Series Optimus Prime (2008)

    

    

        A remold of the original Optimus Prime toy with slightly altered colors. The toy
        comes with larger missiles and smaller smokestacks for safety purposes. It also
        comes a DVD of the pilot episodes of the 1984 animated series, a reprint of the
        original Marvel comics book, and a sound box with vocals from Peter Cullen and
        various sound clips. . [24 ]

of merchandise than one can comfortably count, with one of the most outrageous being the
"Optimus Prime Oral Care Station". Several statues and busts of Prime have been released by
various companies since the return of Transformers to prominence, and other figures
released include various PVCs as part of Takara's "Super Collection Figure" line, which were
later imported as part of Hasbro's " Heroes of Cybertron " series. Larger "Mega Collection
Figure" PVCs were articulated and came with energy axe and gun figures.
