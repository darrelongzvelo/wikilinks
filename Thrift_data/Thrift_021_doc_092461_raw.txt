Unveiled! Hawaii's 1961 long-form birth certificates



By Jerome R. Corsi

Â© 2009 WorldNetDaily

Eleanor Nordyke displays photostats of her twin daughters' birth certificates ( Courtesy
Honolulu Advertiser)

Images of two 1961 Hawaii birth certificates similar to the one President Obama purportedly
has on file have now been unveiled.

The Honolulu Advertiser published photostats of the original long-form birth certificates
of twin daughters born to Eleanor Nordyke at Kapi'olani Maternity and Gynecological
Hospital Aug. 5, 1961, one day after Obama was supposedly born at the same facility.

The Nordykes' certificates include information missing from the short-form document for
Obama published online, including the name of the hospital, the name of the attending
physician , name and address of the parents, the race of the parents and the race of the baby.

As WND reported yesterday , Hawaii's director of health responded to the growing controversy
over the White House's

Image: http://kona.kontera.com/javascript/lib/imgs/grey_loader.gif refusal to
release Obama's original long-form birth certificate by issuing a statement about the
document in apparent contravention of Hawaiian law.

Dr. Chiyome Fukino declared she has seen the "original birth records" that verify Obama was
born in Hawaii and is a "natural-born American citizen," the Honolulu Advertiser reported.

NEW YORK â€” Fox News Channel commentator Glenn Beck said he believes President Barack
Obama is a racist. Beck made the statement during a guest appearance Tuesday on the "Fox &
Friends" morning show. He said Obama has exposed himself as a person with "a deep-seated
hatred for white people or the white culture."

His remarks came during a discussion of Obama's reaction to the arrest of Harvard University
scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. Gates is black and was arrested for disorderly conduct by a white
policeman over a misunderstanding about a break-in at Gates' home.



An Obama spokesman, William Burton, said the White House had no comment on Beck.

Dr. King's Dream or the Cult of Obama?





Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b0288330115714c72d0970c-800wi

Editors note: Mr. Merola is the Republican candidate for the State House of Delegates in the

advertising and public relations firm in Washington, DC. PLEASE VISIT HIS WEBSITE and look at
his platform! We need more like this in our state capitals and in DC!





While watching the Obama inauguration on television, I could not help but be struck by two very
different emotions. On the one hand, I was happy for the African-American community. An
African-American President in the White House is certainly a symbol of affirmation of the
civil rights movement. However, on the other hand, I was also left with a feeling of
disappointment when I contemplated just who is President.

When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. marched for civil rights, he was building upon a legacy set in
motion by those before him. People like Jackie Robinson and Jesse Owens opened the eyes of the
nation to the equality of African-American people by breaking new ground. What is not often
known is the class and integrity with which they broke that ground.

Letâ€™s take Jackie Robinson for example. He endured racist insults and
discrimination from his own teammates his first year in major league baseball. Instead of
retaliating, Robinson put his Christian faith into action by â€œturning the other
cheekâ€� and pressing on. This resulted in his winning the respect of his teammates,
including the players who once opposed him.  MORE>>>>>>>>>

Walter Cronkite, the Racecar Driver! Yes you read it right!



â€œIs that Walter Cronkite?â€� I asked.

â€œYes, it is,â€� answered Donald Davidson, an auto racing historian with an
encyclopedic memory.

We were watching old racing movies â€” this was many years ago â€” and I spied Mr.
Cronkite in a segment of an old Indianapolis 500 race.

â€œCronkite came to the Indianapolis 500 many times,â€� recalled Mr. Davidson,
who is now historian for the Indianapolis Motor Speedwayâ€™s museum. â€œUsually
he was the guest of team owner Lindsey Hopkins. Not many people know that in the 1950s Cronkite
was an aspiring race driver and was apparently quite talented.â€�

Indeed, the author Brock Yates remembered Mr. Cronkite, who died Friday at the age of 92 , was a
regular at racetracks like Bridgehampton on Long Island, as early as 1949. Mr. Cronkite would
come with his friends, like the â€œTodayâ€� show host Dave Garroway and the actor
Jackie Cooper, who was racing his own Austin-Healey, Mr. Yates wrote in his book,
â€œAgainst Death and Time.â€�

Mr. Cronkite was also a regular at Manhattan eateries that were popular with racers, like Le
Chanteclair, which was owned by the former Formula One racer Rene Dreyfus , and
Sardiâ€™s. And Mr. Cronkite was an early member of the Madison Avenue Sports Car and
Chowder Society , a group of automotive journalists, sports-car enthusiasts and racers.



Records are sketchy from this era, for those sleuthing to learn how many races Mr. Cronkite
might have started, how he finished or what he drove. But there are bits and pieces. He
apparently raced not only at Bridgehampton Raceway , which has since closed, but also at Lime
Rock in Connecticut and Watkins Glen in upstate New York.

Mr. Cronkite drove several times in the Little Le Mans endurance races in the late 1950s at Lime
Rock, in a Volvo PV444 . He once finished as high as third over all; he took home the
winnerâ€™s trophy, however, for coming in first in his class.

â€œHe drove in the 12 Hours of Sebring once, 1959, I believe, and he filed radio reports for
CBS between shifts,â€� Mr. Davidson said Monday in an e-mail exchange.

Indeed, Mr. Cronkite is listed as driving a Lancia Appia Zagato with two other drivers in the
1959 Sebring classic; they finished fifth in their class and 40th over all (a record 74 percent
of starters finished that year). This was a tough crowd in which to hold oneâ€™s own;
others in the field included the overall winners Phil Hill, Dan Gurney, Olivier Gendebien and
Chuck Daigh, along with the Formula One legends Bruce McLaren and Stirling Moss.

Mr. Cronkite was well acquainted with Mr. Moss and interviewed him on several occasions. Mr.
Cronkite reported for CBS on a number of races in which Mr. Moss competed, including the Monaco
Grand Prix (seen in the video above, via the Lawrence Journal-World ).

Mr. Cronkite was an avid sports reporter in those days, and when the Olympics were televised
for the first time, in 1960 from Squaw Valley, Calif., Mr. Cronkite was the on-site anchor for
CBSâ€™s coverage.

But Mr. Cronkiteâ€™s racing career fell victim to his aspirations at CBS. â€œHis
bosses told him that if he wanted to go anyplace in the news business, he had to give up
racing,â€� Mr. Davidson noted. â€œIt was just too dangerous â€“- and it was in
those days â€“- and they didnâ€™t want to put anyone on the air who might be maimed or
killed at any given moment.â€�

Drivers, fans gather at former stock car track in Danbury



Editors note: I grew up in New Milford Ct. and attended the races at Danbury for years, working
on the team of popular driver Kenny Webb. As most short tracks today can barely get by, Danbury
was jammed packed every Saturday night with up to 10,000 screaming fans. Some 30 years later,
former fans still come to the reunions in droves to meet their favorite, but aging stars!



Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b028833011572360bb2970b-800wi



























































Kenny Webb's #2--- I am the 4th one from the left, much blonder, younger and skinnier! click on
picture for full size image





Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b028833011572360db3970b-800wi
DANBURY, Conn. - On Saturdays for nearly 30 years - interrupted only by a few years fighting the
Korean War - Nick Giardina raced Ford flatheads and overheads around the 1,800-foot speedway
that surrounded the Danbury Fairgrounds, hitting speeds of about 100 mph on the
straightaways, a little less on the curves.

 Progress ended all that in 1981 for Giardina - and for hundreds of other drivers and the
thousands of fans who packed the grandstands to watch them - when the fairground was paved over
to make way for a mall with a similar name.





"It was the biggest thing," said Giardina, 77, a Katonah resident and a retired truck driver.
"Nothing like it. We were the most popular track around. They'd fill the stands every Saturday
night. I don't know how many thousands it held."





Yesterday, Giardina joined hundreds of other drivers and fans to relive their stock car glory
at the annual reunion of the Southern New York Racing Association, which was launched at a dirt
track in Valhalla in 1948 and moved to Brewster in 1950 and then to Danbury in 1952.





The event was held at Western Connecticut

Image: http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/2.gif State University, where the
blue rubber floor was crowded with low-slung chassis with fat tires and oversized engines
poking through their hoods - some looking like they could go airborne - ogled by a lot of guys
with graying ponytails.





"It's a young man's sport now," Randy LaJoie, the 1981 champion in the Modified Sportsman
division at the Danbury track and the 1983 rookie of the year in NASCAR's Busch North Series,
said in between autographs. "You got to be 20 and pretty. My mirror tells me I'm neither."

Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b028833011571417464970c-800wi





LaJoie, 47, was enticed to stock car racing by his father, Don, a five-time champion on the
Danbury track, and first raced when he was legally old enough at 18. He said he misses the
Racearena, as it was called, but credits its demise with launching his NASCAR career.





He moved from Norwalk, Conn., to Concord, N.C, shortly after the track closed and now owns a
business that manufactures safety seats for race cars, but he said he misses Danbury.





"There's no place in the country that had the atmosphere, and I've been to hundreds of
racetracks," he said. "The people - it was like a cult. Every driver had a following. They sat in
groups, and they might have fought. The purse up here was amazing compared to today."





Winning purses were based on a night's admission. LaJoie said his father sometimes took home
as much as $8,000 on a Saturday night.





"If they didn't close it," he said, "I'd still be here."

America's Prophet Douglas MacArthur - Forwarned us-we didn't listen



By Bob Barney:



Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b028833011572342efc970b-800wi
Here are two speeches, of many. Long, sometimes tedious, we have highlighted important
aspects of his words, but please take the time to read and understand what this man had to say.
His words were from God, he was a prophet, military genius and the greatest American of the 20th
century! MacArthur also cautioned the young President Kennedy to avoid a U.S. military
build-up in Vietnam, pointing out that domestic problems should be given a much greater
priority. Kennedy was said to have come out of the more than three-hour meeting 'stunned' and
'enormously impressed'. unfortunately, the President didn't listen to his warning and
59,000 Americans paid the price. MacArthur and his second wife, Jean Faircloth, spent the
last years of their life together in the Penthouse of the Waldorff-Astoria. After his death
Jean continued to live in the Penthouse until her death. The couple are entombed together in
downtown Norfolk, Virginia; their burial site is in the rotunda of a memorial
building/museum (formerly the Norfolk city hall) dedicated to his memory, and there is a
major shopping mall (MacArthur Center) named for him across the street from the memorial.
According to the museum, General MacArthur chose to be buried in Norfolk because of his
mother's ancestral ties to the city. Today, literally hundreds of millions of people owe
their freedom, their way of life, and there prosperity to this great man. Ironically most of
these people do not know it, or even know his name today. He wrote the Constitution of Japan,
which forbade that country to ever have a military again. That nation's wealth and security is
because of this man alone! Many today deride the General, call him a demagogue. He was vain,
arrogant and sometimes aloof, but what separates him from those monsters like Hitler who have
some of those same attributes is his belief in the true God, and God's divine guidance over him.
He knew it, and trusted it. Once when his staff were dodging bullets, scrambling for safety
behind a jeep, they peered out to see MacArthur, standing tall and totally unafraid of the
situation.... "Doesn't he think he can get killed," a staffer asked the other.



The instant reply from his aide in horror, "Goddamn it, of course he does'nt!"



When his wife asked him (after failing to win the nomination for President) "What kind of
President will Mr. Eisenhower make?"  He replied... "I think a good one! He was the best
orderly that ever worked for me!"



Today, his prophetic words are hauntin g now more than ever....

Listen to the general, in his own words. he wrote all of his speeches himself!

Obama: 'Victory' Not Necessarily Goal in Afghanistan



SOUNDS LIKE VIETNAM 2 DOESN'T IT???????



Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b0288330115713f840e970c-800wi
President Obama has put securing Afghanistan near the top of his foreign policy agenda, but
"victory" in the war-torn country isn't necessarily the United States' goal, he said
Thursday in a TV interview.

"I'm always worried about using the word 'victory,' because, you know, it invokes this notion
of Emperor Hirohito coming down and signing a surrender to MacArthur," Obama told ABC News.

The enemy facing U.S. and Afghan forces isn't so clearly defined, he explained.

Iran Threatens Strike on Israel's Nuclear Facilities if Attacked



Weak diplomacy leads to WAR. This may be a WORLD WAR!





Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b0288330115713f7fce970c-800wi
Iranâ€™s Revolutionary Guards said Saturday the country would strike Israel's
nuclear facilities if Tel Aviv attacked the Islamic state, Reuters reported state
television as saying.

"If the Zionist Regime (Israel) attacks Iran, we will surely strike its nuclear facilities
with our missile capabilities," Mohammad Ali Jafari, Guards commander-in-chief, said.

Jafari said Israel was entirely within the reach of Iran.

"Our missile capability puts all of the Zionist regime (Israel) within Iran's reach to
attack," Jafari said.

Iranian leaders have said Iran would respond to any attack from Israel by targeting U.S.
interests and Israel.

Jafari said Iran "was not scared" of Israel's military capabilities.

"It is part of the psychological war that the West has launched against Iran," Jafari said.

Obama as a witch doctor leads to accusations of racism against St. Petersburg doctor David
McKalip





Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b02883301157233fe42970b-800wi
You saw it here first! Now it's racism! Yeah, from the guy who brought you Reverend Wright!

The Plain Truth from two weeks ago!







ST. PETERSBURG â€” A prominent St. Petersburg doctor and conservative activist has
drawn a flood of criticism for e-mailing an image depicting President Barack Obama as a witch
doctor with a loin cloth, exotic headdress and bones in his nose.

"ObamaCare, coming soon to a clinic near you,'' reads the caption on the e-mail forwarded
earlier this week by St. Petersburg neurosurgeon David McKalip.

Several popular liberal blogs, including Talking Points Memo, Huffington Post and Daily
Kos, highlighted McKalip's e-mail Thursday and castigated him for racism. McKalip said he
was flooded with calls from people attacking him over the e-mail, which he said he had
forwarded to "a limited group" of about 150 people.

"I am not a racist. I am simply a person speaking up to make sure patients don't get hurt by the
government and by insurance companies,'' said McKalip, who earlier this month organized
"tea party" rallies across Florida denouncing Obama's health care reform proposals.
"Because I've been so effective in pointing out how the government plans are going to hurt
patients in very serious ways â€Š the only way they can neutralize my message is to
discredit me personally."

McKalip, who has written guest columns for the St. Petersburg Times on tax and health care
issues, teaches at the University of South Florida, is president-elect of the Pinellas
County Medical Association, and a board member of the Florida Medical Association â€”
which denounced McKalip's e-mail and urged him to apologize to Obama. He has become an
increasingly visible political activist, founding advocacy groups including Cut Taxes
Now, the Florida Taxpayers Alliance and Doctors for Patient Freedom.

McKalip noted that he helped organize a career counseling day several years ago for
African-American Boy Scouts and blamed liberal activists for promoting the witch doctor
image more than he did. He called the e-mail "satire," but later Thursday night released a
statement apologizing to Obama.

"I recognize that this image is offensive and hope that the nation refocuses on assuring all
Americans have access to high-quality, affordable health care with no party interfering in
the patient-physician relationship," McKalip said.

He is expecting protesters outside his office soon. The Daily Kos site is encouraging people
to lodge complaints against him with his affiliated hospitals, USF, and the state Department
of Health.

The Genesis enigma: How DID the Bible describe the evolution of life 3,000 years before
Darwin?



Pure nonsense, but worth the read anyway!

Daily Mail (UK), By Christopher Hart-- The revalation came to Professor Andrew Parker during
a visit to Rome. He was in the Sistine Chapel, gazing up at Michelangelo's awesome ceiling
paintings, when a realisation struck him with dizzying force. 'A Biblical enigma exists that
is on the one hand so cryptic it has remained camouflaged for millennia, and on the other so
obvious one cannot miss it.' The enigma is that the order of Creation as described in the Book of
Genesis, and so powerfully depicted in the Sistine Chapel by the greatest artist of the
Renaissance, has been precisely, eerily confirmed by modern evolutionary science. Yet how
on earth could this be possible? And why had nobody noticed it before? Such was the starting
point of Parker's jaw-dropping new book, The Genesis Enigma: an astounding work which seeks
to prove that the ancient Hebrew writers of the Book of Genesis knew all about evolution - 3,000
years before Darwin. It takes a journey back through aeons of geological time, and also into
the minds and imaginations of the ancient Israelites. Andrew Parker is a leading scientist in
his field: a research fellow at Oxford University, research leader at the Natural History
Museum, and as if that weren't enough, a professor at Shanghai's Jiao Tong university. As a
scientist he never paid much heed to the Book of Genesis, assuming, like most of his
colleagues, that such primitive mythology - which is believed to have been compiled from
several sources between 950 and 500 BC - has long since been 'disproved' by hard scientific
fact. But after his Sistine Chapel moment, he went back to look at Genesis in more detail. And
what he read astonished him. It was even, he says, 'slightly scary'. Somehow - God alone knew
how - the writer or writers of that ancient text had described how the evolution of life on earth
took place in precise detail and perfect order. ... The Genesis enigma: How DID the Bible
describe the evolution of life 3,000 years before Darwin?-7/19

Barack Obama discovers socialist projects at home and a pro-Marxist foreign policy are
making him unpopular



Thank God we have foreign media, cause our MSM is silent!

Telegraph (UK), by Gerald Warner -- Are the people rejecting their saviour? Barack
Obamaâ€™s approval rating has slipped to below that of George â€œDubyaâ€�
Bush at the same stage in his presidency and this is causing some concern among right-thinking
(by which, of course, I mean left-thinking) people. This is by no means the death of the dream
that began in January â€“ approval ratings slide up and down erratically â€“ but it
is at least an early intimation of mortality. ... Read More......Barack Obama discovers

Animal-Rights Fanatic to Be Obamaâ€™s Next â€œCzarâ€�?



MORE CRAZIES WORKING FOR OBAMA

Glenn Beck reports that an animal-rights fanatic is on track to become President
Obamaâ€™s regulatory czar. That individual is the radical legal theorist Cass
Sunstein who has argued that: your money doesnâ€™t really belong to you because the
government laid the foundations for your success; Internet censorship is a good idea;
animals should be allowed to sue people; the names of carbon dioxide emitters should be
compiled as part of a â€œgreenhouse gas inventoryâ€� and publicized to shame those
emitters into changing their behavior; and Americansâ€™ support for property rights
and freedom of contract is an â€œincoherentâ€� form â€œof so-called
individualism.â€� Beck noted that Sunstein co-wrote Nudge, a paternalistic book in
which he argued that people need to be encouraged to make the right choices in their personal
lives. David Martosko of the Center for Consumer Freedom described Sunstein as a close friend
of President Obamaâ€™s who happens to be a â€œraving animal rights nut.â€�
â€œHe is a philosopher in the mold of Peter Singer,â€� explained Martosko. Singer,
an animal rights fanatic who also believes that human parents should be legally permitted to
kill a â€œseverely disabledâ€� infant up to 28 days after its birth, recently wrote
in a New York Times op-ed that healthcare rationing (for people) is both moral and good public
policy. Martosko said Sunstein, whom the president has nominated to be administrator of the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Budget and Management,
believes â€œgovernment has to lead you by the nose in every facet of life.â€�
Sunstein believes that all of your rights exist only because the federal government allows
you to have them.... Read more...Animal-Rights Fanatic to Be Obamaâ€™s Next

Obama recalls Apollo 11 splashdown in Hawaii â€“ while he lived in Indonesia

Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin salutes U.S. flag on moon, July 20, 1969



On this week's 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, President Obama praised the
pioneering American astronauts and recalled his own childhood memories in Hawaii of NASA
capsules splashing down in the Pacific.

But Houston, we have a problem. The president actually lived in Indonesia in 1969.

Obama met with Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin
in the Oval Office  July 20 to commemorate the historic landing.

He praised the men for their "heroism, calm under pressure" and "grace."

"I think that all of us recall the moment in which mankind finally was untethered from this
planet and was able to explore the stars; the moment in which we had one of our own step on the moon
and leave that imprint that is there to this day," the president said.  MORE>>>>>>>>

About Time: Calif. budget plan includes new offshore oil



LOS ANGELES â€“ The deal to close California 's $26 billion budget deficit included a
plan to drill for offshore oil, drawing allegations that the fiscal crisis was used for a
backroom deal following rejection of the idea by state regulators earlier this year.

Democrats agreed to Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's request to expand drilling
from an existing platform off Santa Barbara to generate a one-time $100 million advance
royalty payment this fiscal year and an estimated $1.8 billion in royalties over 14 years.

It would be the first new offshore oil drilling on state lands in four decades since a blowout on
a platform off Santa Barbara coated miles of ocean and shoreline and galvanized opposition.

latest.

Thousands trying to access naked footage of ESPN reporter Erin Andrews duped into
downloading virus





Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b0288330115712e82f1970c-800wi
Thousands of voyeurs got a lesson in karma over the weekend when they tried to download naked
footage of ESPN reporter Erin Andrews - but got a computer virus instead.

Video of the pretty and popular sports reporter undressing in a hotel room hit the web last
week. It was taken through the door's peephole and shows the 31-year-old stark naked.

Now hackers are taking advantage of the much-Googled download. Many links that claim to have
the tape actually have a virus.

"Hackers are no slacks when it comes to taking advantage of a hot Internet search trend. And
they have been quick to set up bogus webpages claiming to contain the video footage of Ms.
Andrews in her hotel room," Graham Cluley of the anti-virus software company Sophos told USA
Today .

Many of the real video links were broken after Andrews' lawyer and the ESPN legal team stepped
in - pointing out that she is actually the victim of a crime.

"While alone in the privacy of her hotel room, Erin Andrews was surreptitiously videotaped
without her knowledge or consent," her lawyer said in a statement.

"Although the perpetrator or perpetrators of this criminal act have not yet been identified,
when they are identified she intends to bring both civil and criminal charges against them and
against anyone who has published the material," the lawyer wrote.

81-year-old qualifies for NASCAR West series race





Image: http://www.ThePlainTruth.com/.a/6a00e554d79b02883301157125851d970c-800wi
PORTLAND, Ore. â€” 81-year-old Hershel McGriff has become the oldest driver to take
part in a national NASCAR series race after qualifying for a Camping World West Series event at
Portland International Raceway.

McGriff took part in Sunday's pre-race qualifying but made the race as one of 26 drivers
competing for 28 spots in the field.

McGriff has not raced in a NASCAR series event since 2002.

In a career that has spanned six decades, he won four NASCAR Cup races, and 37 races on the West
series.He is a member of the Motorsports Hall of Fame.

The Bi-Mart Salute to the Troops 125 at Portland's road course was scheduled later Sunday.

Hershel McGriff (born December 14 , 1927 ) won four races during his brief career in the NASCAR
Grand National (now Sprint Cup ) series, and later in the NASCAR Winston West Series .

McGriff first raced on September 16, 1945, right after racing resumed in the United States
after World War II. He was the winner of the first Carrera Panamericana in 1950, where he met
NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr.[2] France convinced McGriff to come south and race in NASCAR
races at Daytona Beach, the first Southern 500 race at Darlington Raceway, Detroit, and
Raleigh.



France convinced McGriff to race full-time in NASCAR in 1954. He had his four wins that year in
the Grand National series. He had 17 Top 10 finishes in 24 events, and finished sixth in the
final points standings.McGriff's average finishing position was higher than points
champion Lee Petty.



McGriff had two options to choose from for the 1955 season. He was offered a ride in NASCAR to
race for millionarie Carl Kiekhaefer's newly formed team. McGriff decided to return home to
the West Coast to be closer to his family, and to tend to his growing timber and mill business.
Tim Flock drove Kiekhaefer's Chrysler 300 to 18 victories that season and the season
championship.



McGriff returned to racing after not racing for around 10 years. He started 41st at Riverside
in 1967, and had moved up to second place by the sixth lap. He beat Ron Grable in a photo finish
that day.



He became the oldest driver to win a NASCAR feature race when he won an AutoZone West Series race
in 1989 at the age of 61. His 14 wins at the defunct Riverside International Raceway is the most
at NASCAR-sanctioned events, and he was chosen as the grand marshal for the final race at the
track in 1988.



In November 1996, McGriff made the trip with several NASCAR champions, current Winston Cup,
Busch Grand National and Craftsman Truck Series drivers to Japan's Suzuka Raceway for an
exhibition race. He started 26th and finished 25th in what was called the NASCAR Suzuka
Thunder Special.



On July 19 2009, an 81 year old Hershel raced on the Portland International Raceway. The last
time he raced on the course, he was the winner. Oddly, this was also the last time that the
Camping World West Series, then known as the Winston West Series visisted the course.



 Career awards



McGriff was inducted in the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame in its first class in 2002. He was
inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2006. McGriff, who retired from
driving at age 74 said, "This is fantastic, getting in the Hall of Fame, but, hey, I might not be
through yet. When I turn 80 [in two years], I just might go out to a short track and show the young
guys that I can still do it."
