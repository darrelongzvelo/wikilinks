    - “I have SO much going on, why should I not just take it to a drive-thru quick lube for my
    oil change and other service recommendations?”

    



    With our new found way of life, we value how fast we can obtain at the flip of a switch.We view
    our cars as rockets to propel us from one destination to the next. Gas up and GO is what we
    have been accustomed to. The quicker I can get there, the sooner I can get started, I can
    finish my tasks, I can get home & Relax. I will explain the Pros & CONS of the quick lube
    industry and why it may not be in your Family’s best interest.

    - Quality over Quantity will win every time.

    



    Being involved in the automotive, construction, and real estate industry, I have come to
    the ultimate conclusionâ€Š “ a little goes a long way”. Let me explain; We all say
    this over time “it’s the little things that make all the difference.” In any
    industry it’s the little things that have HUGE Results. Never has that been more true in
    this techno driven world. Taking your RocketShip “I mean Car =)” to a quality
    oriented service center is priceless for many reasons. The most important is personal
    pride. Certified technicians pride at being the best in their craft.

    - Value of an Independent/Specialist

    



    Coming from a background of a self-employed Family, three things I learned in life;
    Reputation, Reputation, Reputation. What consumer’s say about your Business is
    Results Driven http://www.consumeraffairs.com/automotive/jiffy_lube.htm . The
    value of relationship between Customer & Consumer is Priceless! With the independent
    service specialist the Consumer has special and key benefits. “ What benefits do I
    get?” you ask?

    1 - Independent is Success oriented

    

    2 - Specialist are eager to please and be acknowledged

    

    3 - They take Great pride knowing they can do the same service as the Dealerships for a lot
    less $.

    

    4 - They Love to Under-Promise & Over-Deliver .

    

    5 - The Better the quality of the relationship, the more you save on repairs through the
    life of your car.

    

    

    - What does this all mean?

    



Bottom Line, The more you Confide Trust in your Independent service center, the more they
value your business and always will make sure they go the extra mile to assure you your

Vic’s Bimmer Shop Repairs Mini-Coopers!



Mini Cooper



For the Mini marque, seeÂ  Mini (marque) . For other uses, seeÂ  Mini (disambiguation) .

TheÂ  Mini is a smallÂ  car that was made by theÂ  British Motor Corporation (BMC) and
its successors from 1959 until 2000. The original is considered a British icon of the 1960s,
[3] [4] [5] and its space-saving front-wheel-drive layout (which allowed 80% of the area of
the car’sÂ  floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage) influenced a generation of
car-makers. [6] The vehicle is in some ways considered the British equivalent to its German
contemporary, theÂ  Volkswagen Beetle , which enjoyed similar popularity in North
America. In 1999 the Mini was voted the second most influentialÂ  car of the 20th Century ,
behind theÂ  Ford Model T . [7] [8]

This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC byÂ  Sir Alec Issigonis . [9] [10] It was
manufactured at theÂ  Longbridge andÂ  Cowley plants in England, the Victoria Park /
ZetlandÂ  British Motor Corporation (Australia) factory inÂ  Sydney , Australia, and
later also in Spain ( Authi ), Belgium, Chile, Italy ( Innocenti ), Portugal, South Africa,
Uruguay, Venezuela and Yugoslavia. The MiniÂ  Mark I had three major UK updates: the Mark
II, the Clubman and the Mark III. Within these was a series of variations including anÂ 
estate car , aÂ  pickup truck , aÂ  van and theÂ  Mini Moke â€”aÂ  jeep -like
buggy. The Mini Cooper and Cooper “S” were sportier versions that were successful as
rally cars , winning theÂ  Monte Carlo Rally four times from 1964 through to 1967, although
in 1966 the Mini was disqualified after the finish, along with six other British entrants,
which included the first four cars to finish, under a questionable ruling that the cars had
used an illegal combination of headlamps and spotlights. [11] Initially Minis were marketed
under theÂ  Austin andÂ  Morris names, as the Austin Seven and Morris Mini Minor, until
Mini became aÂ  marque in its own right in 1969. [12] [13] The Mini was again marketed under
the Austin name in the 1980s.

[ edit ] Design and development



Designed as project ADO15 ( A ustin D rawingÂ  O ffice project numberÂ  15 ), the Mini came
about because of a fuel shortage caused by the 1956Â  Suez Crisis . [14] Petrol was once again
rationed in the UK, sales of large cars slumped, the market for GermanÂ  Bubble cars
boomed.Â  Leonard Lord , the somewhatÂ  autocratic head of BMC, reportedly detested
these cars so much that he vowed to rid the streets of them and design a ‘proper miniature
car’. [15] He laid down some basic design requirements: the car should be contained within a
box that measured 10 Ã— 4 Ã— 4Â ft (3 Ã— 1.2 Ã— 1.2Â m); and the passenger
accommodation should occupy 6Â ft (1.8Â m) of the 10Â ft (3Â m) length; and the
engine, for reasons of cost, should be an existing unit. Issigonis, who had been working
forÂ  Alvis , had been recruited back to BMC in 1955 and, with his skills in designing small
cars, was a natural for the task. The team that designed the Mini was remarkably small: as well
as Issigonis, there was Jack Daniels (who had worked with him on theÂ  Morris Minor ), Chris
Kingham (who had been with him at Alvis), two engineering students and four draughtsmen.
Together, by October 1957, they had designed and built the original prototype, which was
affectionately named “The Orange Box” because of its colour. [3]

The ADO15 used a conventionalÂ  BMC A-Series four-cylinder water-cooled engine, [16] but
departed from tradition by mounting itÂ  transversely , with the engine-oil-lubricated,
four-speed transmission in theÂ  sump , and by employingÂ  front-wheel drive . Almost
all small front-wheel-drive cars developed since have used a similar configuration, except
with the transmission usually separately enclosed rather than using the engine oil. The
radiator was mounted at the left side of the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be
retained, but with reversed pitch so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under
the front wing. This location saved precious vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of
feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine. It also exposed
the entire ignition system to the direct ingress of rainwater through the grille.

1959 Morris Mini-Minor interior

TheÂ  suspension system, designed by Issigonis’s friendÂ  Dr. Alex Moulton atÂ 
Moulton Developments Limited , used compact rubber cones instead of conventional springs.
This ingenious space-saving design also featured rising progressive-rate springing of the
cones, and provided some natural damping, in addition to the normal dampers. Built into the
subframes, the rubber cone system gave a raw and bumpy ride which was accentuated by the
woven-webbing seats, but the rigidity of the rubber cones, together with the wheels being
pushed out to the corners of the car, gave the MiniÂ  go kart -like handling that would become
famous.

Initially an interconnected fluid system was plannedâ€”similar to the one that Alec
Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis. They had assessed the
mechanically interconnectedÂ  Citroen 2CV suspension at that time (according to an
interview by Moulton with CAR magazine in the late 1990s), which inspired the design of the
Hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Morris/Austin 1100, to try to keep the
benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good
control and the tyre in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV was
very much lacking. The short development time of the car meant this was not ready in time for the
Mini’s launch. The system intended for the Mini was further developed and theÂ 
hydrolastic system was first used on theÂ  Morris 1100 , launched in 1962; the Mini gained
the system later in 1964. Ten-inch (254Â mm) wheels were specified, so new tyres had to be
developed, the initial contract going toÂ  Dunlop . Issigonis went to Dunlop stating that
he wanted even smaller, 8Â in (203 mm) wheels (even thoughÂ  he had already settled on
ten-inch). An agreement was made on the ten-inch size, after Dunlop choked on the eight-inch
proposition.

Sliding windows allowed storage pockets in the hollow doors; reportedly Issigonis sized
them to fit a bottle ofÂ  Gordon’s Gin . [9] TheÂ  boot lid was hinged at the bottom so that
the car could be driven with it open to increase luggage space. On early cars theÂ  number
plate was hinged at the top so that it could swing down to remain visible when the boot lid was
open. This feature was later discontinued after it was discovered that exhaust gases could
leak into the cockpit when the boot was open.

The Mini was designed as aÂ  monocoque shell with welded seams visible on the outside of the
car running down theÂ  A and C pillars , and between the body and the floor pan. To further
simplify construction, the hinges for the doors and boot lid were mounted externally.

Cross-section shows how Mini maximizes passenger space

Production models differed from the prototypes by the addition of front and rear subframes to
the unibody to take the suspension loads, and by having the engine mounted the other way round,
with theÂ  carburettor at the back rather than at the front. This layout required an extra
gear between engine andÂ  transmission to reverse the direction of rotation at the input to
the transmission. Having the carburettor behind the engine reducedÂ  carburettor icing ,
but theÂ  distributor was then exposed to water coming in through the grille. The engine
size was reduced from 948Â cc to 848Â cc; this, in conjunction with a small increase in
the car’s width, cut the top speed from 90Â  mph (145Â  km/h ) to a more reasonable (for
the time) 72Â mph (116Â km/h).

Despite its utilitarian origins, the classic Mini shape had become so well known that by the
1990s,Â  Rover Group â€”the heirs to BMCâ€”were able to register its design as a
trade mark in its own right. [17]

[ edit ] Mark I Mini: 1959â€“1967

The first Morris Mini-Minor sold in Texas being delivered to a family in Arlington, Texas in
1959. See also:Â  Mark I Mini

The production version of the Mini was demonstrated to the press in April 1959, and by August
several thousand cars had been produced ready for the first sales. [18]

The nameÂ  Mini did not appear by itself immediatelyâ€”the first models being
marketed under two of BMC’s brand names,Â  Austin andÂ  Morris . The nameÂ  Austin
Seven (sometimes written asÂ  SE7EN in early publicity material) recalled the popular
smallÂ  Austin 7 of the 1920s and 1930s. The other name used until 1967 in the United Kingdom
(and in Commonwealth countries such as Australia),Â  Morris Mini-Minor , seems to have
been a play on words. The Morris Minor was a well known and successful car, with the wordÂ 
minor being Latin for “lesser”; so an abbreviation of the Latin word for
“least”â€” minimus â€”was used for the new even smaller car. It was
originally going to be called the Austin Newmarket.

1963 Austin Mini 850 Mark I

One of the very first examples from 1959 is now on display at theÂ  National Motor Museum
inÂ  Hampshire . [19] The very first example, with the now iconic registration plate “621
AOK”, is on display at theÂ  Heritage Motor Centre inÂ  Warwickshire . [20]

Until 1962, the cars appeared as theÂ  Austin 850 andÂ  Morris 850 in North America and
France, and in Denmark as theÂ  Austin Partner (until 1964) andÂ  Morris Mascot (until
1981). The nameÂ  Mini was first used domestically by BMC for Austin’s version in 1961,
when theÂ  Austin Seven was rebranded as theÂ  Austin Mini , [21] somewhat to the surprise
of theÂ  Sharps Commercials car company (later known asÂ  Bond Cars Ltd ) who had been
using the nameÂ  Minicar for their three-wheeled vehicles since 1949. However, legal
action was somehow averted, [22] and BMC used the nameÂ  Mini thereafter. [23]

In 1964, the suspension of the cars was replaced by another Moulton design, theÂ 
hydrolastic system. The new suspension gave a softer ride but it also increased weight and
production cost and, in the minds of many enthusiasts, spoiled the handling characteristics
for which the Mini was so famous. In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was
retained for the remaining life of the Mini.

Austin Mini Van,Â  The Automobile Association livery

From October 1965 the option of anÂ  Automotive Products (AP) designed four-speedÂ 
automatic transmission became available. Cars fitted with this became the Mini-Matic

Slow at the outset, Mark I sales strengthened across most of the model lines in the 1960s, and
production totalled 1,190,000. [24] Sold at almost below cost, the basic Mini made very
little money for its owners. However, it still did make a small profit.Â  Ford once took a
Mini away and completely dismantled it, possibly to see if they could offer an alternative. It
was their opinion though, that they could not sell it at BMC’s price. Ford determined that
the BMC must have been losing around 30 pounds per car, and so decided to produce a larger car –
theÂ  Cortina , launched in 1962 – as its competitor in the budget market.

BMC insisted that the way company overheads were shared out, the Mini always made money. [25]
Larger profits came from the popularÂ  De Luxe models and from optional extras such as seat
belts, door mirrors, a heater and a radio, which would be considered necessities on modern
cars, as well as the various “Cooper” and “Cooper S” models.

The Mini etched its place into popular culture in the 1960s with well-publicised purchases by
film and music stars. [26]



[ edit ] Mark II Mini: 1967â€“1973



The Mark II Mini featured a redesigned grille which remained with the car from that point on.
Also, a larger rear window and numerous cosmetic changes were introduced. 429,000 Mark II
Minis were made. [24] [27] [28]

A bewildering variety of Mini types were made inÂ  Pamplona , Spain, by theÂ  Authi
company from 1968 onwards, mostly under the Morris name.

The Mini was arguably the star of the 1969 filmÂ  The Italian Job , which features a car chase
in which a gang of thieves drive three Minis down staircases, through storm drains, over
buildings and finally into the back of a moving bus. This film wasÂ  remade in 2003 using
theÂ  new MINI .

1968 Mark III Riley Elf.

[ edit ] Variants



The popularity of the original Mini spawned many models that targeted different markets.

[ edit ] Wolseley Hornet and Riley Elf (1961â€“1969)



Built as more luxurious versions of the Mini, both theÂ  Wolseley Hornet and theÂ  Riley
Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more
traditionalÂ  three-box design . Front-end treatment, which incorporated each
marque’s traditional upright grille design, also contributed to a less utilitarian
appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis,
and additional chrome accents, bumper overriders and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was
the more expensive of the two cars. [29] The name “Wolseley Hornet” was first used on aÂ 
1930s sports car , while the name “Elf” recalled theÂ  Riley Sprite and Imp sports cars,
also of the 1930s. The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet.
This better dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.

Both cars went through three versions. Initially, they used the 848Â cc engine, changing
to a single carburettor version of the Cooper’s 998Â cc power unit in the Mark II in 1963.
The MKIII facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents; also
concealed door hinges two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. 30,912 Riley
Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built. [24]

Mark II Austin Mini Countryman

[ edit ] Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1961â€“1969)



Two-door estate cars with double “barn”-style rear doors. Both were built on a slightly
longer chassis of 84Â  inch (2.14Â m) compared to 80.25Â inch (2.04Â m) for the
saloon.

The luxury models had decorative, non-structural wood inserts in the rear body which gave the
car a similar appearance to the larger Morris Minor estate which had some of the look of an
American-style 1950sÂ  Woodie . Approximately 108,000 Austin Mini Countrymen and 99,000
Morris Mini Travellers were built. [24]

[ edit ] Mini Van (1960â€“1982)



A commercial panel van rated at &frac14;-ton load capacity. Built on the longer Traveller
chassis but without side windows, it proved popular in 1960s Britain as a cheaper alternative
to the car: it was classed as a commercial vehicle and as such carried no sales tax. A set of
simple stamped steel slots served in place of a more costly chrome grille. The Mini Van was
renamed as the Mini 95 in 1978, the number representing the gross vehicle weight of
0.95Â tons. 521,494 were built. [24] Despite this renaming, the motoring public
continued to call it the Mini Van, as a result of which [ citation needed ] the class of vehicles
known asÂ  minivans in other countries are referred to in Britain as MPVs.

[ edit ] Mini Moke (1964â€“1989)

Main article:Â  Mini Moke

A utility vehicle intended for the British Army, for whom a few twin-engined 4-wheel-drive
versions were also built. Although the 4WD Moke could climb a 1:2 gradient, it lacked enough
ground clearance for military use. [30] The single-engined front-wheel-drive Moke enjoyed
some popularity in civilian production. About 50,000 were made in total, [24] from 1964 to
1968 in the UK, 1966 to 1982 in Australia and 1983 to 1989 in Portugal. [31] The car featured in
the cult 1967 TV seriesÂ  The Prisoner , and is popular in holiday locations such as Barbados
and Macau, where Mokes were used as police cars. Mokes were also available to rent there as
recently as March 2006. “Moke” is archaic British slang for a donkey.

A Mini Pickup.

[ edit ] Mini Pick-up (1961â€“1982)



A pick-up truck, 11Â ft (3.4 m) from nose to tail, built on the longer Mini Van platform, with
an open-top rear cargo area and a tailgate. The factory specified the weight of the Pickup as
less than 1,500Â lb (680 kg) with a full 6Â imperialÂ gallons (27 L; 7Â US gal) of
fuel.

As with the Van, the Pickup did not have a costly chrome grille. Instead, a simple set of stamped
metal slots allowed airflow into the engine compartment. The Pickup was spartan in basic
form, although the factory brochure informed prospective buyers that “[a] fully equipped
Mini Pick-up is also available which includes a recirculatory heater.” Passenger-side
sun visor, seat belts, laminated windscreen, tilt tubes and cover were available at extra
cost. [32] Like the van, the Pickup was renamed as the Mini 95 in 1978.

A total of 58,179 Mini Pickups were built. [24]

[ edit ] Morris Mini K (March 1969 â€“ August 1971, Australia only)



Built in the Australian British Motor Corporation factory at Zetland, NSW using 80% local
content, the Morris Mini K was advertised as the “great leap forward”. [33] The Mini K
(‘K’ standing for Kangaroo) had a 1098 cc engine and was the last round-nose model to be
produced in Australia, originally priced at $1780 (AUD).

[ edit ] Mini Cooper and Cooper S: 1961â€“2000



Issigonis’ friendÂ  John Cooper , owner of theÂ  Cooper Car Company and designer and
builder ofÂ  Formula One and rally cars, saw the potential of the Mini for competition.
Issigonis was initially reluctant to see the Mini in the role of a performance car, but after
John Cooper appealed to BMC management, the two men collaborated to create theÂ  Mini
Cooper , a nimble, economical and inexpensive car. The Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini
Cooper debuted in 1961. [9] [34]

The original 848Â cc engine from the Morris Mini-Minor was given a longer stroke to
increase capacity to 997Â cc, boosting power from 34Â  bhp to 55Â bhp (25 to 41Â  kW
). [16] The car featured a racing-tuned engine, twinÂ  SU carburettors , a closer-ratio
gearbox and frontÂ  disc brakes , uncommon at the time in a small car. One thousand units of
this version were commissioned by management, intended for and designed to meet theÂ 
homologation rules ofÂ  Group 2 rally racing. The 997Â cc engine was replaced by a
shorter stroke 998 ccÂ unit in 1964.

1963 Austin Mini Cooper S

A more powerful Mini Cooper, dubbed the “S”, was developed in tandem and released in 1963.
Featuring a 1071Â cc engine with a 70.61Â mm bore and nitrided steel crankshaft and
strengthened bottom end to allow further tuning; and largerÂ  servo-assisted disc
brakes, 4,030 Cooper S cars were produced and sold until the model was updated in August 1964.
Cooper also produced two S models specifically for circuit racing in the under 1000cc and
under 1300cc classes respectively, rated at 970Â cc and a 1275Â cc, both with the
70.61mm bore and both of which were also offered to the public. The smaller-engine model was
not well received, and only 963 had been built when the model was discontinued in 1965. The
1275Â cc Cooper S models continued in production until 1971.

Sales of the Mini Cooper were as follows: 64,000 Mark I Coopers with 997Â cc or 998Â cc
engines; 19,000 Mark I Cooper S with 970Â cc, 1071Â cc or 1275Â cc engines; 16,000
Mark II Coopers with 998Â cc engines; 6,300 Mark II Cooper S with 1275Â cc engines. There
were no Mark III Coopers and just 1,570 Mark III Cooper S’s.

The Mini Cooper S earned acclaim withÂ  Monte Carlo Rally victories in 1964, 1965 and 1967.
[35] Minis were initially placed first, second and third in the 1966 rally as well, but were
disqualified after a controversial decision by the French judges. The disqualification
related to the use of a variable resistanceÂ  headlamp dimming circuit in place of a
dual-filament lamp. [36] It should be noted that theÂ  CitroÃ«n DS that was eventually
awarded first place had illegal white headlamps but escaped disqualification. [37] The
driver of the CitroÃ«n,Â  Pauli Toivonen , was reluctant to accept the trophy and vowed
that he would never race for CitroÃ«n again. [38] BMC probably received more publicity from
the disqualification than they would have gained from a victory. [39]

1965Â  Monte Carlo Rally winner: 1964 Morris Mini Cooper S

In 1971, the Mini Cooper design was licensed in Italy byÂ  Innocenti and in 1973 to Spain by
Authi (Automoviles de Turismo Hispano-Ingleses), which began to produce the Innocenti Mini
Cooper 1300 and the Authi Mini Cooper 1300, respectively. The Cooper name disappeared from
the UK Mini range at this time, as British Leyland (as it was by then) supposedly did not want to
pay John Cooper royalties for the use of his name, so it was not seen again on Minis for nearly 20
years!

A new Mini Cooper named the RSP (Rover Special Products) was briefly relaunched in 1990-1991,
with slightly lower performance than the 1960s Cooper. It proved so popular that the new
Cooper-marked Mini went into full production in late 1991. From 1992, Coopers were fitted
with aÂ  fuel-injected version of the 1275Â cc engine, and in 1997 a multi-point fuel
injected engine was introduced, along with a front-mounted radiator and various safety
improvements. [40]

[ edit ] Mini Clubman and 1275GT: 1969â€“1980



In 1969, under the ownership of British Leyland, the Mini was given a facelift by stylistÂ 
Roy Haynes , who had previously worked for Ford . The restyled version was called the Mini
Clubman, and has a squarer frontal look, using the same indicator/sidelight assembly as
theÂ  Austin Maxi . The Mini Clubman was intended to replace the upmarket Riley and Wolseley
versions. A new model, dubbed the 1275GT, was slated as the replacement for the 998Â cc Mini
Cooper (the 1275Â cc Mini Cooper S continued alongside the 1275GT for two years until
1971). The Clubman Estate took over where the Countryman and Traveller left off.

However, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959 “round-front” design,
alongside the newer Clubman and 1275GT models (which were replaced in 1980 by the new
hatchbackÂ  Austin Metro , while production of the original “round-front” Mini
design continued for another 20 years.)

Production of the Clubman and 1275GT got off to a slow start because the cars incorporated
“lots of production changes” including the relocation of tooling from the
manufacturer’sÂ  Cowley plant to theÂ  Longbridge plant: very few cars were handed
over to customers before the early months of 1970. [41]

Early domestic market Clubmans were still delivered on cross-ply tyres despite the fact that
by 1970Â  radials had become the norm for the car’s mainstream competitors. [41] By 1973
new Minis were, by default, being shipped with radial tyres, though cross-plies could be
specified by special order, giving British buyers a price saving of Â£8. [42]

The 1275GT is often incorrectly described as the “Mini Clubman 1275GT”. The official
name was always just the “Mini 1275GT”, and it was a separate, distinct model from the
Clubman (although it shared the same frontal treatment as the Mini Clubman, and was launched
at the same time).

In 1971, the 1275Â cc Mini Cooper S was discontinued in the UK, leaving the Mini 1275GT as the
only sporting Mini on sale for the rest of the decade. Innocenti in Italy, however, continued
making their own version of the Mini Cooper for some time. While the UK built 1275GT was not
nearly as quick as a 1275 Mini Cooper S, it was cheaper to buy, run, and insure. It was the first
Mini to be equipped with aÂ  tachometer . It also featured a standard-fit close-ratio
gearbox. Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0â€“60Â mph
(97 km/h) in 12.9Â seconds, and the excellent midrange torque offered a 30â€“50 mph
(48â€“80 km/h) time in top gear of only nine seconds. The bluff front, however, meant
that the model struggled to reach 90Â mph (140 km/h). The 1275Â cc A-series engine could
be cheaply and easily tuned, though the cheap purchase price and prominent “sidewinder”
door stripes meant that this model developed a reputation as something of a “boy-racer
special” during the 1970s and into the 1980s.

The Mini Clubman and 1275GT were responsible for two motoring “firsts”: they were the
first vehicles to use a flexi printed-circuit board behind the dash instruments (universal
nowadays, but technically advanced for 1969). Secondly, the 1275GT was the first vehicle to
be offered withÂ  run-flat tyres ; from 1974 this model could be ordered with optional
Dunlop Denovo tyres on 12-inch (300 mm) diameter rims. In the event of a puncture, the Dunlop
Denovo tyre would not burst and quickly deflate, but could continue to be used safely at speeds
of up to 50Â mph (80 km/h). This was a useful safety feature, although the increased road
noise and relatively poor grip of this tyre meant that many 1275GT buyers ignored this option.

Throughout the 1970s, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959
“round-front” design, alongside the newer Clubman and 1275GT models. The long-nose
Clubman and 1275GT offered better crash safety, were better equipped, and had vastly better
under-bonnet access, but they were more expensive and aerodynamically inferior to the
original 1959 design. The Mini Clubman and 1275GT were replaced in 1980 by the new hatchback
Austin Metro, while production of the original “round-front” Mini design continued for
another 20 years. At the end of Clubman and 1275GT production, 275,583 Clubman saloons,
197,606 Clubman Estates and 110,673 1275GTs had been made. [24]

The Leyland Mini LS was produced by Leyland Australia from 1977 to 1978.

For the Australian market, all Minis including the Van gained the Clubman front in 1971
although the car was still basically a Mk I behind the A-Pillar. [43] The Australian van thus
became the only Clubman Van produced anywhere in the world. [43] From mid 1971 to the end of
1972, a Clubman GT version of the sedan was produced. [44] This was essentially a Cooper S in
Clubman body, equipped with the same 7.5-inch (190 mm) disc brakes, twin fuel tanks, and
twin-carb Cooper S 1275Â cc engine. Australian Clubman sedans were marketed under
theÂ  Morris Mini Clubman name when introduced in August 1971, [45] and as theÂ  Leyland
Mini , without the Clubman name, from February 1973. [46] To end Mini production in Australia,
a limited edition runout model was produced âˆ’ the 1275LS. Originally created as a top
end model, when the decision was made to end production, it became the runout model. Fitted
with a pollution control 1275cc engine sourced from Europe, the LS had a single 1.5Â inch
carburettor and 8.4Â inch disk brakes. It was available in Nugget Gold and Hi-Ho Silver
only with interior trim to match. Production of this model commenced in July 1978 and
concluded in October 1978 with an approximate total of 800 vehicles produced.



[ edit ] Mark III and onwards: 1969â€“2000



The Mark III Mini had a modified bodyshell with enough alterations to see the factory code
change from ADO15 to ADO20 (which it shared with theÂ  Clubman ). The most obvious changes
were larger doors with concealed hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being
replaced with winding windowsâ€”although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis
had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows). The suspension
reverted fromÂ  Hydrolastic to rubber cones [47] as a cost-saving measure. [48] (The 1275
GT and Clubman would retain the hydrolastic system until June 1971 when they, too, switched to
the rubber cone suspension of the original Minis. [47] )

Production at the Cowley plant was ended, and the simple nameÂ  Mini completely replaced
the separate Austin and Morris brands. [49]

In the late 1970s, Innocenti introduced theÂ  Innocenti 90 and 120 ,Â  Bertone -designed
hatchbacks based on the Mini platform. Bertone also created a Mini Cooper equivalent,
christened theÂ  Innocenti De Tomaso , that sported a 1275Â cc engine similar to the MG
Metro engine but with a 11 stud head, a special inlet manifold and used the “A” clutch
instead of the “Verto” type. The most important feature was the utilization of
homokinetic shafts, avoiding the rubber couplings.

By this stage, the Mini was still hugely popular in Britain, but it was looking increasingly
outdated in the face of newer and more practical rivals including theÂ  Ford Fiesta ,Â 
Vauxhall Chevette ,Â  Chrysler Sunbeam ,Â  Fiat 127 ,Â  Volkswagen Polo andÂ 
Peugeot 104 . Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical
supermini to replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British
Leyland for the home market.

Reports of the Mini’s imminent demise surfaced again in 1980 with the launch of theÂ 
Austin Mini-Metro (badging with the wordÂ  mini in all lowercase). In New Zealand in 1981,
the Mini starred in a road trip movie directed byÂ  Geoff Murphy calledÂ  Goodbye Pork Pie
. The Mini was beginning to fall out of favour in many export markets, with the South African,
Australian, and New Zealand markets all stopping production around this time.

    Although the Mini continued after the Metro’s launch, production volumes were
    reduced as British Leyland and successor combine Rover Group concentrated on the Metro
    as its key supermini. Indeed, 1981 was the Mini’s last year in the top ten of Britain’s
    top selling cars, as it came ninth and the Metro was fifth.

    - Mark III (introduced in November 1969) had wind up windows with internal door hinges
    except for the van and pickup models. The boot lid lost the original hinged number plate
    and its recess shape and a large rear colour coded lamp was fitted in its place, along with
    larger rear side windows.

    

    

    - Mark IV (introduced in 1976) had a front rubber mounted subframe with single tower bolts
    and the rear frame had some larger bushes introduced. Twin stalk indicators were
    introduced with larger foot pedals. From 1977 onwards, the rear indicator lamps had the
    reverse lights incorporated in them.

    

    - Mark V (from 1984): all cars had 8.4-inch (210 mm) brake discs and plastic wheel arches
    (mini special arches) but retained the same Mark IV body shell shape.

    

    - Mark VI (from 1990): the engine mounting points were moved forward to take 1275Â cc
    power units, and includes theÂ  HIF carb version, plus the single point fuel injected
    car which came out in 1991. The 998Â cc power units were discontinued. Internal bonnet
    release were fitted from 1992.

    

    - Mark VII (from 1996): was the final version, twin point injection with front mounted
    radiator. Full-width dashboard replaces the original shelf, internal bonnet release.
    Introduction ofÂ  airbag on driver’s side.

    



[ edit ] End of production



Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market enjoyed numerous “special editions”
of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon. It was this
image that perhaps helped the Mini become such an asset forÂ  BMW , which later bought the
remnants of BMC as theÂ  Rover Group . It was even more popular in Japan, where it was seen as a
retro-cool icon, and inspired many imitators. TheÂ  ERA Mini Turbo was particularly
popular with Japanese buyers.

In 1994, underÂ  Bernd Pischetsrieder , aÂ  first cousin once removed of Issigonis, BMW
took control of the Rover Group, which included the Mini, fitting anÂ  airbag to comply with
European legislation.

By March 2000, Rover was still suffering massive losses, and BMW decided to dispose of most of
the companies. The sell-off was completed in May that year.Â  MG and Rover went toÂ 
Phoenix , a new British consortium; andÂ  Land Rover was sold toÂ  Ford Motor Company . BMW
retained the Mini name and the planned new model, granting Rover temporary rights to the brand
and allowing it to manufacture and sell the run-out model of the old Mini. By April 2000, the
range consisted of four versions: the Mini Classic Seven, the Mini Classic Cooper, the Mini
Classic Cooper Sport andâ€”for overseas European marketsâ€”the Mini
Knightsbridge. The last Mini (a red Cooper Sport) was built on 4 October 2000 and presented to
the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust in December of that year. [3] A total of 5,387,862
cars had been manufactured. [24]

After the last of the Mini production had been sold, the ‘Mini’ name reverted to BMW
ownership. The newÂ  ‘BMW’ MINI is technically unrelated to the old car but retains the
classic transverse 4-cylinder, front-wheel-drive configuration and iconic
“bulldog” stance of the original.

[ edit ] Limited editions

Main article:Â  List of Mini limited editions

From the Mark IV onward, many special limited-production editions of the Mini were offered.
These included models that were created to commemorate racing victories or to celebrate an
anniversary of the Mini marque. Limited editions generally came equipped with a unique
combination of interior and exterior trim and special decals. Examples include Mini 1100
Special, Mini Rio, Mini Mayfair, Mini Park Lane, Mini Italian Job, Mini Cooper RSP, Mini
Flame, Mini Racing and the Mini Monza.

[ edit ] Concepts and unproduced prototypes



From 1967 to 1979, Issigonis had been designing a replacement for the Mini in the form of an
experimental model called the 9X. [9] It was longer and more powerful than the Mini, but due to
politicking insideÂ  British Leyland (which had now been formed by the merger of BMC’s
parent companyÂ  British Motor Holdings and theÂ  Leyland Motor Corporation ), the car
did not reach production. It was an intriguing “might-have-been”; the car was
technologically advanced, and many believe it would have been competitive up until the
1980s.

A number of prototypes produced for vehicles based on the Mini but which never saw production
are held and sometimes displayed at the BritishÂ  Heritage Motor Centre museum atÂ 
Gaydon ,Â  Warwickshire . These included the Twini, a re-engineeredÂ 
four-wheel-drive Moke with two enginesâ€”one at the front and another at the back; the
Austin Ant, a second attempt to produce a four-wheel-drive vehicle, this time using aÂ 
transfer case ; and a two-seater convertible MG edition of the Mini, cancelled due to it being
perceived as competition for theÂ  MG Midget .

In 1992, a project considering possible improvements to the Mini was started. CodenamedÂ 
Minki (“Mini” plusÂ  K-Series engine), it included a redesigned dashboard, a
two-pieceÂ  tailgate instead of a boot, fold down rear seats,Â  Hydragas suspension and
a 3-cylinder version of the K-Series engine with a 5-speed gearbox. [51]

However, the project was cancelled by management within Rover, who decided that the cost of
engineering the changes, and achieving compliance with modern crash testing standards, was
too great for the production volumes that could be expected of an updated Mini.

In 1995 the idea to update the Mini again surfaced but this time with BMW management. As part of
the process of deciding how to replace the Mini, a vehicle representing what the current Mini
could have become, if it had been developed further over its production history, was
commissioned. [51] This resulted in theÂ  Minki-II , designed to house the 1.4L MPI
K-Series engine with an extensive redesign inside, but without the original Minki’s
tailgate. The car had to be widened by 50mm and lengthened by 50mm to accommodate the new engine
and gearbox, with Hydragas suspension and dashboard from aÂ  Rover 100 . The Minki-II was
used for Hydragas development work, this suspension being considered at the time for the R59
project, later to become theÂ  BMW MINI .

[ edit ] Exotic Minis and celebrities



The Mini was a cultural icon and shows up in movies such asÂ  The Italian Job (1969), in which 3
Mark I Austin Mini Cooper S cars are used in a gold bullion robbery; inÂ  The Bourne Identity
(2002) as a beat-up but surprisingly capable vehicle for a car chase;Â  Goodbye Pork Pie
(1981) where a yellow Mini 1000 is used to travel the length of New Zealand, or inÂ  Lara
Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) as a collectible fashion icon garaged alongside other classic
sports cars. It has also featured in television shows such asÂ  Mr. Bean and (as theÂ  Mini
Moke ) in The Prisoner . Madeline Zimmer, in Jean-Luc Godard’s Masculin fÃ©minin (1966),
said she hoped her new single would be a big hit so she can buy a Morris Cooper.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Mini also became a veritable “ fashion statement “. Many
celebrities of that era drove Minis that had been customised by famous BritishÂ 
coachbuilders . Examples includeÂ  Peter Sellers ‘Â  wicker side-panelled Mini
built byÂ  Hooper (theÂ  Rolls-Royce coachbuilder) [52] [53] which appeared in his
movieÂ  A Shot in the Dark .Â  Ringo Starr ‘s hatchback designed by Radford, who also
built a Mini de Ville forÂ  Britt Ekland , Peter Sellers’ wife, with a special rear estate
wagon door. [54] Radford also built Mini de Villes forÂ  John Lennon , Marianne Faithfull
and aÂ  psychedelic version that appeared in theÂ  Beatles movieÂ  Magical Mystery
Tour owned byÂ  George Harrison who maintained it through the years and had it restored,
including the art, prior to making an appearance with it atÂ  Goodwood as late as June 1998.
[55] Marianne Faithfull drove her duo-tone de Ville to theÂ  Law Courts to hearÂ  Mick
Jagger ‘s appeal of his drug conviction in 1967. [55] The same year John Lennon drove his de
Ville hatchback toÂ  Apple studios after hearing ofÂ  Brian Epstein ‘s death. At
around the same time, Radford also extensively customised a 1275 Mini-Cooper S for
MonkeyÂ  Michael Nesmith which gave dramatically improved performance combined with
luxury and silence. [55] Coachbuilders Wood & Pickett also made special versions called the
Margrave and Margrave SE, [53] [56] sold byÂ  Mayfair dealerships inÂ  mod London and
elsewhere. Marc Bolan famously died when the Mini 1275GT in which he was a passenger hit a Tree
in Barnes, London on the 16th September 1977. The site is now Officially Recognised by theÂ 
English Tourist Board asÂ  Bolan’s Rock Shrine [57]

In the 1980s a very exclusive mini was available with only 3 being made. This was the BAC-M30
mini. The BAC-M30 featured a 1380 avonbar modified engine, was fitted withÂ  Recaro seats
and a custom dashboard, one was most noticeably owned byÂ  Bernie Ecclestone and recently
auctioned off. [58]

One of threeÂ  Outspan Orange Minis, photographed on Madeira Drive in Brighton. Main
article:Â  List of Mini based cars

The cheapness, simplicity and easy availability of used Minis make it an ideal candidate for
body replacement.Â  There are over 120 Mini-basedÂ  kit cars from various small
companies and individual enthusiasts. There are also numerous dramatically modified Minis
such as a set of three street-legal cars made up to look like giant oranges as a promotion for
theÂ  Outspan company, a Mini that was made to look like a half-timbered cottage, complete
withÂ  thatched roof and windows with curtains. Some enthusiasts have drastically
shortened or lowered their cars to make them yet smaller. There is also a “sprint shell”
which has a lower roof and a small body chop, which dramatically reduces drag. Others make
small versions ofÂ  stretched limos ,Â  double-decker busses ,Â  monster trucks
,Â  motor homes and many other kinds of vehicles from used Minis.

Years after the Mini finally ended its production run, there are still ample third-party
partsâ€”both spares for restoration and performance parts for race tuning. [59] [60]
[61] [62] [63]

Given the low weight and good handling of the Mini it is also popular to do anÂ  engine swap
putting in a modern, high performance engine like the Rover K Series, a Honda VTEC B16A2, a
Suzuki Swift GTi, a rear mounted Yamaha R1 motorbike engine, or the Vauxhall 16v 2Â litre
c20 XE “red top” engine, amongst various alternatives. [64]

[ edit ] Awards



The Mini has won many awards over the years, perhaps the most notable include: “Car of the
Century” ( Autocar magazine 1995), “Number One Classic Car of All Time” ( Classic &
Sports Car magazine 1996) and “European Car of the Century” in a worldwideÂ  Internet
poll run by the prestigiousÂ  Global Automotive Elections Foundation in 1999. The Mini
managed second place (behind theÂ  Model T Ford ) for “Global Car of the Century” in that
same poll.

In the end 5.3 million Minis were sold, making it by far the most popular British car ever made.
Thousands of these are still on the road, with the remaining pre-1980s versions being firmly
established as collectors’ items.

[ edit ] Minis in the United States

A typical meeting of theÂ  Mini Owners of Texas club inÂ  Grapevine, Texas .

Between 1960 and 1967, BMC exported approximately 10,000 left-hand drive BMC Minis to the
United States. Sales were discontinued when stricter federal safety standards were imposed
in 1968; the Mini’s wheelbase was too short to comply. TheÂ  ‘A’-series engine,
contrary to popular belief, was fully compliant with federal and state emissions standards,
as shown by theÂ  Austin America which was sold in the United States until 1972. As this was a
larger car, the minimum wheelbase legislation did not affect its saleability.

Minis that were originally sold in the US are becoming hard to find, so most of the restored
Minis now running in the US have been imported by individual enthusiastsâ€”typically
from Australia or New Zealand where the climate has limited the amount of rust formation and
cars are available for relatively low prices. There is increasing difficulty in finding cars
that are old enough to meet the 25 year emissions exemption and yet are still in a reasonable
condition. This has led some importers to place theÂ  vehicle identification number (VIN)
plates from older cars onto Minis that are less than 25 years oldâ€”claiming that the car
was “repaired” by replacing every single part with the exception of the VIN plate. Such
vehicles are termed “re-VINs” and are surprisingly common. [65] This may leave such
importers open to accusations of a “ Ship of Theseus ” fraud such as befell the lateÂ 
Boyd Coddington from theÂ  State of California .

An Almond Green Mark I Morris Mini Minor

At its peak, the Mini was a strong seller in most of the countries where it was sold, with the
United Kingdom inevitably receiving the highest volumes.

It was a huge seller in the mini-car market, which it virtually monopolised until the arrival
of theÂ  Hillman Imp in 1963. It comprehensively outsold the Imp, and it was 16 years before
the Mini received a serious threat to its sales success. This threat came in the shape of the
much more modern and practicalÂ  Vauxhall Chevette of 1975, but the Mini continued to sell
in huge volumes and was still very popular when its “replacement”â€”theÂ  Metro
â€”arrived in 1980. By this time, the Mini’s design had been overtaken by numerous
more modern and practical efforts, but it still offered sheer driving fun that was almost
unbeatable in this size of car.

Although the Metro never actually replaced the Mini, production figures for the Mini dipped
during the 1980s, and interest in the now-iconic design was not revived until the
re-introduction of the famous Mini Cooper in 1989. This helped the car retain its
desirability and driver appeal throughout the 1990s, right up to the end of production on 4
October 2000. Nearly a decade after its demise, the Mini is still a common sight on Britain’s
roads, and the many surviving pre-1980s models in particular are now widely regarded as
collector’s items.

A total of 1,581,887 Minis were sold in Britain after its launch in 1959. The last new one to be
registered was sold in 2004, some four years after the end of production. [66]

1974 Mini ClubmanÂ  Safety Research Vehicle â€”SRV4

Issigonis designed the Mini with an emphasis onÂ  active safety . Asked about the crash
worthiness of the Mini he saidÂ  “I make my cars with such good brakes, such good steering,
that if people get into a crash itÂŽs their own fault” . [67] andÂ  “I donâ€™t
design my cars to have accidents” . [68] It is generally acknowledged that the Mini was
designed with excellent handling characteristics. [69]

In July 1965Â  BMC announced that following “comments by safety experts” about the
Mini’s external doorhandles, these would be modified on new cars so that the gap between the
handle and the door panel would be effectively closed. [70]

Nicholas Faith states in his book thatÂ  Murray Mackay , one of the UK’s leading motor
vehicle crash and safety researchers, was critical of the pre-1967 Mini’sÂ  passive
safety features, including the protruding filler cap, the door latch, and the vulnerability
of the passenger space to engine intrusion. [67]

The Mini was withdrawn from the American market because it could not meet the 1968 U.S. safety
regulations but was sold in Canada till 1979 [67] [71] and more intenseÂ  emission
standards , [72] and was never updated to comply with those regulations. [71]

Throughout its life, the Mini was modified in various ways to improve its safety. In 1974 a
prototype Mini experimental safety vehicle was built (Mini Clubman SRV4) which featured a
longerÂ  crumple zone , a “pedestrian friendly” front-end, run-flat tyres,
strengthened door sills, extra internal padding and recessed door handles. [73] Jack
Daniels , one of the original Issigonis team, [74] is stated to have been working on further
safety improvements for the Mini when he retired in 1977. [67] Several times it was thought
that safety regulations would stop Mini production [75] Safety improved in 1996, with the
introduction ofÂ  airbags and side impact bars. [76] The Mini, challenged by increasingly
demanding European safety and pollution standards, was planned byÂ  British Aerospace to
be taken out of production in 1996, but BMW chose to invest to keep the Mini legal until the
launch of theÂ  BMW MINI . [77]

In January 2007, theÂ  Which? magazine listed theÂ  Mini City in its “Ten worst cars for
safety (since 1983)” list, alongside other economical, lightweight, fuel efficient cars
like theÂ  Hyundai Pony 1.2L ,Â  Fiat Panda 900 Super ,Â  Suzuki Alto GL ,Â  Daihatsu
Domino ,Â  CitroÃ«n AX 11 RE ,Â  Yugo 45 and 55 ,Â  Peugeot 205 GL , and theÂ 
CitroÃ«n 2CV 6. [78]

A UK Department for Transport statistics publication, presenting estimates of the risk of
driver injury in two car injury collisions, based on reported road accident data, estimated
that the 1990â€“2000 Mini was one of two small cars (the other being theÂ  Hyundai Atoz
), which, with an estimated 84% of drivers likely to be injured, presented the greatest risk of
driver injury. The average risk for the small car category was 76%. [79]

2003Â  BMW MINI Cooper S and Mark III classic Mini. Main article:Â  Mini (BMW)

When production of the classic Mini ceased in 2000, BMW (the new owner of the brand) announced
the successor to the Mini. The brand name for the new car is MINI (written in capital letters),
[80] and it is commonly called the “BMW MINI” or the “New MINI”.

The new MINI is much larger than the original Mini. It is around 58Â centimetres (23 in)
longer, 50Â centimetres (20 in) wider, 7Â centimetres (2.8 in) higher, and weighs
around 1,144Â kg (2,522 lb) rather than 650Â kg (1,433 lb). It is now classified asÂ 
compact car rather thanÂ  city car . [81]

On 3 April 2007, the one millionth MINI rolled out of the Oxford Plant after six years of
production, [82] just one month longer than it took the classic Mini to reach the same total in
March 1965.

BMW Four-Cylinder Engines Return To U.S.



By Jonathan Welsh

    

        

        Image:
        http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ME829_e21_E_20110130225026.jpg

        Many people remember the popular four-cylinder 320i of the late 1970s and early
        1980s. It helped turn the once-obscure BMW into a household term in the U.S.

    



BMW AG says it will bring a four-cylinder automobile engine to the U.S. market later this year.
While BMW sells several four-cylinder motorcycles here, it hasnâ€™t had a
â€œfour-bangerâ€� in its car lineup since 1999.

The move marks aÂ big change in BMWâ€™ s marketing approach in the States. For years
the German car makerâ€™s executives said offering fours would be a waste because
American drivers want the power and torque available onlyÂ from larger engines with six or
more cylinders. Even the compact BMW 1 Series came with a choice of two sixes when it rolled out
about three years ago. The same car typically sells with four cylinders in other global
markets.

Now, though, as fuel efficiency grows in importance to consumersÂ many car companies are
promoting their smaller engines where they used to largely ignore them. Ford says it will soon
offer its new Explorer crossover with a four-cylinder engine while Chevrolet and Buick have
also been pushing fours in certain models. Other rivals from Audi to Hyundai are
toutingÂ their fours for performance as well as economy.

The new 2-liter BMW engine uses turbocharging and a high-pressure direct-injection fuel
system to boost power to 240 horsepower, which is more than the companyâ€™s base 3-liter
six puts out. BMW says it will reveal exactly when the engine will arrive and on which model or
models at a later date.

For people who fell in love with BMW s during the 1960s and 1970s,Â chances areÂ the
object of their affection was a 1600, 2002 or 320i model with a screamingÂ 1.6, 1.8 or
2-liter four-cylinder engine. I learned to drive on my motherâ€™s 1979 320i
andÂ later owned a 1972 2002, soÂ the BMW fours are dearest to my heart. Sure, it is hard to
find fault with the smooth, locomotive pull of the Bimmer straight six, but it always seemed
like overkill in smaller cars like theÂ 3 Series and 1 Series.

The slideshow includes some favorite fours from BMW â€™s past.

BMW Headquarters inÂ  Munich , Germany

 

  Main article:Â  History of BMW

BMW entered existence as a business entity following a restructuring of theÂ  Rapp
Motorenwerke aircraft engine manufacturing firm in 1917. After the end ofÂ  World War I in
1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft engine production by the terms of theÂ  Versailles
Armistice Treaty . [2] The company consequently shifted toÂ  motorcycle production in
1923 once the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted, [3] followed by automobiles in
1928â€“29. [4] [5] [6]

The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel is portrayed by BMW as the movement of an
aircraft propeller, to signify the white blades cutting through the blue skyÂ â€“ an
interpretation that BMW adopted for convenience in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was
created. [7] [8] The emblem evolved from the circularÂ  Rapp Motorenwerke company logo,
from which the BMW company grew, combined with the white and blue colors of the flag ofÂ 
Bavaria , reversed to produce the BMW roundel. However, the origin of the logo being based on
the movement of a propeller is in dispute, according to an article recently posted by the New
York Times, quoting “At the BMW Museum in Munich, Anne Schmidt-Possiwal, explained that
the blue-and-white company logo did not represent a spinning propeller, but was meant to show
the colors of the Free State of Bavaria.”Â  [9]

BMW’s first significant aircraft engine was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine
of 1918, much preferred for its high-altitude performance. [10] With German rearmament in
the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for theÂ  Luftwaffe . Among
its successfulÂ  World War II engine designs were theÂ  BMW 132 andÂ  BMW 801
air-cooledÂ  radial engines , and the pioneeringÂ  BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet , which
powered the tiny, 1944-1945-era jet-powered “emergency fighter”, theÂ  Heinkel He
162 Spatz. The BMW 003 jet engine was tested in the A-1b version of the world’s first jet
fighter, theÂ  Messerschmitt Me 262 , but BMW engines failed on takeoff, a major setback for
the jet fighter program until successful testing with Junkers engines. [11] [12]

By 1959 the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders
meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find a way of carrying on. It was
decided to carry on and to try to cash in on the current economy car boom enjoyed so successfully
by some of Germany’s ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. The
rights to manufacture the ItalianÂ  Iso Isetta were bought; the tiny cars themselves were
to be powered by a modified form of BMW’s own motorcycle engine. This was moderately
successful and helped the company get back on its feet. The controlling majority shareholder
of the BMWÂ  Aktiengesellschaft since 1959 is the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the
stock. The rest is inÂ  public float .

In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake inÂ  California basedÂ  industrial design
studioÂ  DesignworksUSA , which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the
BritishÂ  Rover Group [13] (which at the time consisted of theÂ  Rover ,Â  Land Rover
andÂ  MG brands as well as the rights to defunct brands includingÂ  Austin andÂ  Morris
), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was making huge losses and BMW decided to sell the
combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to formÂ  MG Rover ,
while Land Rover was taken over byÂ  Ford . BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the
newÂ  Mini , which was launched in 2001.

Chief designerÂ  Chris Bangle announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after
serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years. He was replaced byÂ  Adrian van
Hooydonk , Bangle’s former right hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as
the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights forÂ  Husqvarna
Motorcycles was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros.Â  BMW Motorrad plans to
continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales
and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its
present location at Varese.

[ edit ] Production



In 2006, BMW produced 1,366,838 four-wheeled vehicles, which were manufactured in five
countries. [14] In 2009, it manufactured 1,258,417 four-wheeled vehicles. [1] In 2009, BMW
Motorrad produced 82,631 motorcycles. [1]

TheÂ  R32 motorcycle , the first BMWÂ  motor vehicle.

 

 

BMW began building motorcycle engines and then motorcycles afterÂ  World War I . Its
motorcycle brand is now known asÂ  BMW Motorrad . Their first successful motorcycle, after
the failed Helios and Flink, was the “ R32 ” in 1923. This had a “ boxer ” twin engine, in
which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their
single cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this
distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMWs are still produced in this layout, which
is designated theÂ  R Series .

BMWÂ  1955 R67/3 was the last of the “plunger” models

 

 

During the Second World War, BMW produced theÂ  BMW R75 motorcycle with aÂ  sidecar
attached. Featuring a unique design copied from theÂ  ZÃŒndapp KS750, its sidecar wheel
was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockableÂ  differential , this made the vehicle
very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to theÂ  Jeep .

In 1983, came theÂ  K Series , shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four
cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started
making the chain-drivenÂ  F andÂ  G series with single and parallel twinÂ  Rotax
engines.

In the early 1990s, BMW updated theÂ  airhead Boxer engine which became known as theÂ 
oilhead . In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a
built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170Â cc and enhanced performance to
100Â hp (75 kW) for theÂ  R1200GS , compared to 85Â hp (63 kW) of the previousÂ 
R1150GS . More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and
R1200S, producing 98Â hp (73 kW) and 122Â hp (91 kW), respectively.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It
features an engine producing 167Â hp (125 kW), derived from the company’s work with the
Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically
adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.

BMW introducedÂ  anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s.
The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the
way for the introduction ofÂ  electronic stability control , or anti-skid technology
later in the 2007 model year.

BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front
suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to anÂ  Earles fork ,
front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm,
single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called
swinging arm ). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the
Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces
dive under braking.

In July 2007, the SwedishÂ  Husqvarna Motorcycles was purchased byÂ  BMW for a reported
â‚¬93 million. BMW Motorrad plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a
separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the
current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese. [15] Husqvarna
manufacturesÂ  motocross ,Â  enduro andÂ  supermoto motorcycles .

[ edit ] New Class

Main article:Â  BMW New Class

TheÂ  New Class (German:Â  Neue Klasse ) was a line of compactÂ  sedans and coupes
starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW’s
celebratedÂ  four-cylinder M10 engine, the New Class models featured a fullyÂ 
independent suspension ,Â  MacPherson struts in front, and front disc brakes. Initially a
family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door
sports sedans with the addition of theÂ  02 Series 1600 and 2002 in 1966.

Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings
caught auto enthusiasts’ attention and established BMW as an international brand.
Precursors to the famed BMWÂ  3 Series , the two-doors’ success cemented the firm’s
future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in
“0″ were replaced by the largerÂ  BMW 5 Series in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS
coupes were replaced by theÂ  six-cylinder BMW E9 , introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The
1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, the 2002 replaced by the 320i in 1975.

BMW 7-Series (F01)

 

 

BMW’sÂ  full-size flagship executiveÂ  sedan is theÂ  7 Series . Typically, BMW
introduces many of their innovations first in the 7 Series, such as the somewhat
controversialÂ  iDrive system. The 7 Series Hydrogen, featuring one of the world’s
firstÂ  hydrogen fueled internal combustion engines, is fueled by liquid hydrogen and
emits only clean water vapor. The latest generation (F01) debuted in 2009. Based on the 5
Series’ platform, theÂ  6 Series is BMW’sÂ  grand touring luxury sport
coupe/convertible (E63/E64). A 2-seaterÂ  roadster andÂ  coupe which succeeded
theÂ  Z3 , theÂ  Z4 (E85) has been sold since 2002.

BMW M3 CoupÃ© (E92)

 

 

    Based on the 3 Series, theÂ  M3 defined an entirely new market for BMW: a race-ready
    production vehicle. Since its debut, the M3 is heralded in enthusiast circles, in large
    part due to its unique geometry and award winning engines. The newest V8-powered
    platform became available the Autumn of 2007 in Europe, and second quarter of 2008 for the
    U.S. in coupe (E92), and later the cabriolet (E93), and sedan (E90) variants. Based on the
    5 Series, theÂ  M5 is the M division’s V10-powered version of the E60 5 Series. [17]
    TheÂ  M6 is the M division’s version of the 6 Series, and shares its drivetrain with
    the M5. The Z4 M, orÂ  M Coupe / M Roadster , is the M division’s version of the Z4.
    TheÂ  X5M is the M division’s version of the X5, and theÂ  X6M is the M division’s
    version of the X6. Both the X5M and X6M share the same V8 twin scroll twin turbo.

[ edit ] Sport sponsorship beyond motor sport



BMW does more than just motor sport sponsorship. It sponsors international polo matches
played atÂ  Shongweni inÂ  Durban andÂ  Illovo inÂ  Johannesburg , South Africa. [
citation needed ] BMW and theÂ  United States Olympic Committee (USOC) made six year
sponsorship deal official in July 2010. Those at BMW and the USOC officials see nothing
contradictory about a German company sponsoring Olympians in the USA in thisÂ  global
economy . [20]

[ edit ] Environmental record



The company is a charter member of theÂ  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ‘s (EPA)
National Environmental Achievement Track, which recognises companies for their
environmental stewardship and performance. It is also a member of the South Carolina
Environmental Excellence Program and is on theÂ  Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index,
which rates environmentally friendly companies. [21] BMW has taken measures to reduce the
impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by
making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly
fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power
(combustion, engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines. [22]

BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than
140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner
with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.

However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations
ofÂ  greenwash in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions
produced duringÂ  hydrogen fuel production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe
emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions
for car pollution. [23]

[ edit ] Bicycles



BMW has created a range of high-end bicycles sold online and through dealerships. They range
from the Kid’s Bike to the EUR 4,499 Enduro Bike. [24] In the United States, only the Cruise
Bike and Kid’s Bike models are sold. [25]

[ edit ] BMW nomenclature



BMW vehicles follow a certain nomenclature; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2
letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally
represent theÂ  engine displacement in cubic centimeters divided by 100. [26] AÂ 
similar nomenclature is used byÂ  BMW Motorrad for their motorcycles.

    The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:

    - A =Â  automatic transmission

    

    - C =Â  coupÃ© , last used on theÂ  BMW E46 and theÂ  BMW E63 (dropped after 2005
    model year)

    

    - c =Â  cabriolet

    

    - d =Â  diesel â€ 

    

    - e =Â  eta (efficient economy, from theÂ  Greek letter ‘Î·’ )

    

    - g =Â  compressed natural gas/CNG

    

    - h =Â  hydrogen

    

    - i =Â  fuel-injected

    

    - L =Â  long wheelbase

    

    - s = sport, also means “2 dr” on E36 model â€ â€ 

    

    - sDrive =Â  rear wheel drive

    

    - T =Â  touring (wagon/estate)

    

    - Ti =Â  hatchback for theÂ  BMW 3 Series hatchback

    

    - x / xDrive =Â  BMW xDrive all wheel drive

    



â€  historic nomenclature indicating “td” refers to “Turbo Diesel”, not a
diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)

â€ â€  typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded
wheels, etc.

For example, the BMW 760iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 6.0Â liters
of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01.

When ‘L’ supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a
special luxury variant, featuring extended leather and special interior appointments. The
L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.

When ‘X’ is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it
identifies the vehicle as one of BMW’s Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand ofÂ 
crossovers , featuringÂ  BMW’s xDrive . The second number in the ‘X’ series denotes
the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW
cars, the SAV’s main badge does not denote engine size, the engine is instead indicated on
side badges.

The ‘Z’ identifies the vehicle as a two seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). ‘M’
variants of ‘Z’ models have the ‘M’ as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale
(e.g. ‘Z4 M’ is ‘M Roadster’ in Canada).

Previous X & Z vehicles had ‘i’ or ‘si’ following the engine displacement number
(denoted in liters). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X & Z vehicles by
using ‘sDrive’ or ‘xDrive’ (simply meaning rear or all wheel drive, respectively)
followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle’s engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is
a rear wheel drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0Â L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine). [27]

BMW last used the ‘s’ for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the
‘s’ nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is.
The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optionalÂ  dual clutch
transmission that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-lineÂ  M3 . [28] [29]

The ‘M’ â€“ forÂ  Motorsport â€“ identifies the vehicle as a
high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is
the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although ‘M’ cars should be
separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see ‘M’ cars
grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.

[ edit ] Exceptions



There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature. [30]

The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as theÂ  BMW X5 M , could not follow the
regular naming convention since MX5 was used forÂ  Mazda ‘sÂ  MX-5 Miata .

For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally
aspirated engines ( N52 ), not a 2,500Â cc or 2,800Â cc engine as the series designation
number would lead one to believe. The ’28′ is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars,
compared to the 2006 model year ’30′ vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally
aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.

The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-liter engine; however the engines areÂ 
twin-turbocharged ( N54 ) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the
’35′ indicates a more powerful engine than previous ’30′ models that have theÂ 
naturally aspirated N52 engine . The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0
engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent
(’40′ and ‘s’).

The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-liter engines. The E36 318i made after 1996 has a
1.9Â L engine ( M44 ) as opposed to the 1.8Â L ( M42 ) used in the 1992 to 1995 models.

The badging for recent V8 engines ( N62 andÂ  N63 ) also does not indicate displacement, as
the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800Â cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400Â cc
(twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.

From the summer of 2001 until October 2005, BMW hosted theÂ  “BMW Films” . Archived
fromÂ  the original on 2007-09-27. website, showcasing sporty models being driven to
extremes. These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a
ground-breaking online advertising campaign.

Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attendÂ  Bimmerfest .
One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the U.S., over 3,000 people attended in 2006,
and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on May 5.

[ edit ] BMW slang



The initials BMW are pronouncedÂ  [ËˆbeË� ËˆÉ›m ËˆveË�] inÂ  German .
[31] The model series are referred to as “Einser” (“One-er” for 1 series),
“Dreier” (“Three-er” for 3 series), “FÃŒnfer” (“Five-er” for the 5
series), “Sechser” (“Six-er” for the 6 series), “Siebener” (“Seven-er”
for the 7 series). These are not actually slang, but are the normal way that such letters and
numbers are pronounced in German. [32]

The English slang terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are variously used for BMWs of all kinds,
[33] [34] cars, and motorcycles. [35] [36]

In the US, specialists have been at pains toÂ  prescribe that a distinction must be made
between using Beemer exclusively to describe BMW motorcycles, and using Bimmer only to refer
to BMW cars, [37] [38] [39] in the manner of a “true aficionado” [40] and avoid appearing to
be “uninitiated.” [41] [42] The Canadian Globe and Mail prefers Bimmer and calls Beemer a
“yuppie abomination,” [43] while theÂ  Tacoma News Tribune says it is a distinction
made by “auto snobs.” [44] Using the wrong slang risks offending BMW enthusiasts. [45]
[46] [47] An editor ofÂ  Business Week was satisfied in 2003 that the question was resolved
in favor of Bimmer by noting that a Google search yielded 10 times as many hits compared to
Beemer. [48]

1975 BMW 3.0CSL painted by Alexander Calder.

 

 

Manufacturers employÂ  designers for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain
recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond
motor vehicle design. These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW’s marketing and
branding campaigns. [49] TheÂ  headquarters building , designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer
has become a European icon, [50] and artistÂ  Gerhard Richter created hisÂ  Red, Yellow,
Blue series of paintings for the building’s lobby. [51] [52] In 1975,Â  Alexander Calder
was commissioned to paint theÂ  3.0CSL driven by HervÃ© Poulain at theÂ  24 Hours of Le
Mans . This led to moreÂ  BMW Art Cars , painted by artists includingÂ  David Hockney ,Â 
Jenny Holzer ,Â  Roy Lichtenstein , and others. The cars, currently numbering 16, have been
shown at theÂ  Louvre ,Â  Guggenheim Museum Bilbao , and, in 2009, at theÂ  Los Angeles
County Museum of Art and New York’sÂ  Grand Central Terminal . [50] BMW was the principal
sponsor of the 1998Â  The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at theÂ  Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum and other Guggenheim museums, though the financial relationship between BMW and the
Guggenheim was criticised in many quarters. [53] [54]

The 2006 “BMW Performance Series” was a marketing event geared to attract black car
buyers, and featured the “BMW Pop-Jazz Live Series,” a tour headlined by jazz musician
Mike Phillips, and the “BMW Blackfilms.com Film Series” highlighting black
filmmakers. [55]

[ edit ] April Fools



BMW has garnered a reputation over the years for itsÂ  April Fools pranks, which are printed
in the British press every year. In 2010, they ran an advert announcing that customers would be
able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the
political party they supported.

[ edit ] Overseas subsidiaries



[ edit ] South Africa



BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968, [56] when Praetor Monteerders’ plant
was opened inÂ  Rosslyn , nearÂ  Pretoria . BMW initially bought shares in the company,
before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company becameÂ  BMW South Africa , the
first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models
thatÂ  BMW Motorsport created for the South African market were theÂ  E23 M745i (1983),
which used theÂ  M88 engine from theÂ  BMW M1 , the BMW 333i (1986), which added a
6-cylinder 3.2 litreÂ  M30 engine to theÂ  E30 , [57] and theÂ  E30 BMW 325is (1989)
which was powered by anÂ  Alpina -derived 2.7 litre engine.

Unlike U.S. manufacturers, such asÂ  Ford andÂ  GM , which divested from the country in
the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa.

Following the end ofÂ  apartheid in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South
Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on
production of the 3-Series for the export market. South Africanâ€“built BMWs are now
exported toÂ  right hand drive markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the
United Kingdom,Â  Malaysia ,Â  Singapore , and Hong Kong, as well asÂ  Sub-Saharan
Africa . Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles inÂ  left hand drive for export
toÂ  Taiwan , the United States andÂ  Iran , as well as South America.

BMW’s with aÂ  VIN number starting with “NC0″ are manufactured in South Africa.

Greer nearÂ  Spartanburg, South Carolina , USA. [58] The smaller X3 has began production in
Spartanburg. BMW’s with aÂ  VIN number starting with “4US and 5US” are manufactured
in Spartanburg.

In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750 million to expand operations at the Spartanburg
plant. This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant
the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees. [59]

[ edit ] India



BMW India was established in 2006 as a sales subsidiary inÂ  Gurgaon (National Capital
Region). A state-of-the-art assembly plant for BMW 3 and 5 Series started operation in early
2007 inÂ  Chennai . Construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial
investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started operation in the first
quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants ofÂ  BMW 3 Series andÂ  BMW 5 Series .

LANCASTER – Even at 11 years old, Victor Vega was fascinated by BMWs . Vega watched his older
brother race against BMW 1600 and 2002 models on the streets of his home-town in Guadalajara,
Mexico. â€œOne time I tagged along with my brother,â€� Vega said. â€œI saw this
little box on wheels and wanted to know what kind of cars those were. I asked one of the drivers
what they were. He told me it was a German car – a BMW â€� Vega said his curiosity led him to
the library to research BMWs. â€œIt just` amazed me that the company started building
aircraft engines in the first World War and then motorcycles,â€� Vega said. â€œThe
engineering that goes into building

the car – itâ€™s one of the best handling cars in the world.â€� Vegaâ€™s
obsession with the Ger-

man luxury car eventually led him to open his own BMW repair shop – Vicâ€™s Bimmer Shop
Inc .

 

The road to opening the business was not an easy one, Vega said. Fresh out of high school, Vega
moved, to America with his family in 1979. A year later Vega started work as a â€œlot
boyâ€� cleaning cars and chauffeuring customers at Bob Smith BMW in Canoga Park;
â€œI was a lot boy for about six months,â€� Vega said. â€œThen I told my manager
that I wanted to do more ‘than that. I didnâ€™t want to push the broom anymore – I
wanted to be a

mechanic.â€� About six months later Vega became a BMW-certified technician . For the
next few years Vega said he worked for several independent BMW repair shops and he dreamed of
something more 4 owning his own repair business. Vega said he turned to his friend, mentor and
employer for advice. â€œMy old boss told me that I would never be able to open my own
shop,â€� Vega said. â€œThat was like a challenge to me. I wanted to prove him
wrong.â€� -

 

Vega continued to work hard to save his money and study English. In 1987 Vega went to visit his
brother who lived in Rosamond to discuss his business idea. â€œOn a Sunday morning he
drove me to breakfast in Lancaster and I noticed there were quite a few BMW s driving
around,â€� Vega said. â€œI noticed there was a BMW dealership on Sierra Highway I
said it would be a great place to open a BMW repair shop .â€� Vega said the next day he found a
classified advertisement in the newspaper, listing a repair bay for rent on Avenue I and Beech
Street.

â€œIt was a sign,â€� he said. Vega said he sold all of his personal possessions that
were not a

necessity and obtained a loan from his brother. With $10,000 Vega started Vicâ€™s
Bimmer Shop.

â€œThe first year was very very difficult because I didnâ€™t know anything about
business, I just knew how to repair cars. I learned the business aspect as I went
along.â€� Before Vega could afford advertising he would leave his business card on the
windshield of every BMW he came across.

 

Half a year into the business, Vega said he considered shutting down his shop altogether after
a slow Friday â€œMy investment ran out and I called the landlord and said I donâ€™t
think Iâ€™m going to make it,â€� Vega said. â€œIt was on the brink of
closing.â€� Vega said he attended Mass that Sunday and prayed. â€œI left
everything in His hands. I said, â€˜If this is your will (to close the shop), so be
it.â€� On Monday the phone was ringing off the hook, Vega said.

In 1994 Vega moved the shop to a larger location on Avenue L and 10th Street West. Five years
later he moved his business again to its current location at 4 5253 Trevor Avenue . Through the
years Vega said he has built up his clientele through hard work, competitive prices and
exceptional customer service. â€œWe have a friendly atmosphere at our shop. We treat
customers as our friends.â€�

While most of Vegaâ€™s customers are from the Valley drivers have come from as far away as
Long Beach, Thousand Oaks and San Diego.Ron Hawkins of Antelope Acres said he has been taking
his BMWS to Vicâ€™s Bimmer Shop since 1988 when he asked Vega to inspect a BMW he was
looking to purchase.â€œI told (Vega) I wanted to know what was going to go wrong with the
car within the next 20,000 miles and how much it would cost,â€� Hawkins said. â€œHe
spent two hours looking at it and wouldnâ€™t let me pay him.â€� Hawkins said he has
continued bringing his BMWs to Vega for more than 22 years because of his expertise and
integrity â€œI donâ€™t think I would own a BMW in the Antelope Valley if he
wasnâ€™t around, honestly,â€� Hawkins said. .â€˜Heâ€™s a good
mechanic and a good man too.â€�

Vegaâ€™s son, Victor Vega Jr., 30, has worked alongside his father since 1997. Vega
said, with auto-mobiles becoming far more technical since he opened his garage 23 years ago,
he has to constantly stay up to date on the newest technology Vega and his son attend classes

and seminars to remain current. â€œWe have the latest in diagnostic equipment. We can do
whatever the BMW dealer can do. We are constantly updating ourselves and our equipment.”
Although Vega spent two years repairing vehicles manufactured by Volvo and Mercedes-Benz he
eventually decided to stick with BMWS , including Mini Coopers , whichâ€™ are

owned by the car manufacturer. â€œI â€œlove BMWs – they are the love of my
life,â€� Vega said.-â€œThereâ€™s no comparison to when you actually drive
it. BMW is still at the top of the technological advance- When BMW talks, every-one
listens.â€�

Vicâ€™s Bimmer Shop is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Thursday It is closed Friday
through Sunday

Car Care Techniques

If youâ€™re looking for a quickie solution to detailing, youâ€™ll likely get a
quickie result â€” in other words, slow deterioration of your vehicleâ€™s finish
until the point that it looks every bit its age.

This article explains the detailing processes I follow to keep my vehicles looking showroom
new. I screwed up the paint on my first two new cars to bring you this information. I hope you find
it useful.

Detailing Equipment and Supplies



Dual Action, Variable Speed Polisher and Pads



I use a Porter Cable 7424 variable speed dual-action (orbiting) polisher. Variable speed is
essential, since polishing requires a higher speed than glazing, sealing, or waxing, and
dual action is required as circular polishers can cause severe damage to the paint if used
incorrectly. Leave circular polishers to the body shop professionals.

I also have a 6â€³ velcro backing plate to use with a six pack each of polishing pads and
buffing pads. These pads look pretty much the same except that the foam on the polishing pad is
cut with a bit more â€œtoothâ€�, while the buffing pad is perfectly smooth. Each
manufacturer uses different manufacturing techniques and different colored foam, so
youâ€™ll need to look at the description of the pad to figure out if it applies to the your
task at hand.

I have found I donâ€™t need any more than one pad for each polishing and sealant session,
but the key here is to have pads dedicated for each task. Donâ€™t use the same pad for
polishing and sealing. Itâ€™s fairly obvious why but it deserves a mention.

Sheepskin Wash Mits



Sponges of all types, either natural or manufactured, are very coarse and rough on paint. For
this reason I use a sheepskin mit to clean the exterior.

Genuine sheepskin mits used to be available in K-Mart, Walmart and the like, but now all they
carry is the cheaper synthetic sheepskin. I donâ€™t think the synthetic holds up as well
or does as good a job holding water in reserve, but they do have their purpose, like handling
those hard-to-clean rims. I find the relatively thin mits will fit into the nooks and crannies
in my tight-spoked E46 ZHP rims.

Wheel Cleaner



This stuff is mostly unnecessary *provided* you wash the car and the wheels once a week. Most of
these cleaners have mild acids in them and if you can get away with not using them, itâ€™s a
good thing because they will etch the clear over time. I also avoid using wheel cleaner or other
harsh chemicals because Iâ€™m a bit more sensitive to runoff â€” I have a well and
drink the very water I put in the ground.

100% Cotton Terricloth / Microfiber Towels



I like to use 100% cotton terricloth towels to dry the car because they hold a lot of water and are
easy to clean. Just make sure theyâ€™re 100% cotton. If the binding material or base of
the fabric is polyester, it can and will scratch your paint eventually. You see, every time you
clean these things, a bit of the towel finds its way into the dryer lint screen. Eventually,
most of the fluff will be gone and youâ€™ll be left with a towel that still does a good job
drying the car, but may expose the polyester base, which can put fine scratches in the clear.

The best towels to remove detailing materials (polish, glaze, sealant) are microfiber
towels. They have a â€œstickyâ€� quality to them that just seems to clean the car
beautifully with a minimum of streaks. I used to think microfiber towels were a waste of money
â€” and then I tried one. I would not recommend them anytime water is involved (like
drying the car) because thatâ€™s when they tend to smear badly as the polyester fibers
donâ€™t absorb the water as effectively as cotton does.

So, bottom line: terricloth for drying, microfiber for product removal and final cleanup.

Detailing the Exterior



Detailing a carâ€™s exterior typically involves the following processes:

Washing (30 minutes)



This is the first and perhaps most important step, since it will remove a bulk of the surface
grime and make the remaining steps a bit easier and safer for your paint. First of all, I always
pick a shady spot under a tree. I never wash in direct sunlight if I can avoid it. Why? Read the
â€œdryingâ€� section, below.

I typically use a generic soap designed for cars. Some people use Dawn and other harsh soaps to
remove wax prior detailing, but that doesnâ€™t make sense to me since claying or
polishing the surface will strip the wax more effectively.

I place a small amount of detergent in the water â€” enough to create suds and break down
enough of the grease and grime that gets into the soap water, but not so much as to pollute the
water table when I dump the bucket over on the ground.

Before I take the wash mit to the car, I rinse the car thoroughly with plain water. This step is
particularly important if there is visible dirt on the car. If you donâ€™t rinse that
off, it will act like sandpaper and scour the clearcoat.

Hereâ€™s where youâ€™ll definitely recognize your past work. If youâ€™ve
kept the car waxed, merely rinsing the car with water should remove most of the dirt. If you
havenâ€™t waxed the car in the last two months or so, you may find the need to do a bit more
scrubbing. If you must â€œscrubâ€�, be sure to rinse both your wash mit as well as the
surface youâ€™re cleaning on a regular basis, or youâ€™ll definitely scuff the
clear.

And speaking of rinsing, itâ€™s best to rinse the mit with fresh water from the hose
rather than dipping it back in the wash bucket, or youâ€™ll bring a lot of dirt into the
wash bucket that youâ€™ll subsequently apply to the next surface to be cleaned.

Itâ€™s generally a good idea to clean the car starting from the roof and working
downward. The top of the car will generally be cleaner than the bottom and it makes little sense
to expose the entire car to a dirty wash mit when you can limit that exposure.

Drying (5 minutes)



You might be saying, whatâ€™s the big deal about drying a car? Well, there isnâ€™t
really a big deal, provided you know WHERE and HOW to dry the car. First, you should never wash
your car in direct sunlight if you can avoid it. If you donâ€™t have any shade, you should
dry the car as quickly as you can. If you donâ€™t, perhaps the most destructive of all
contaminants â€” water spots â€” will form. Water spots form as a consequence of
drying hard water, but even softened well water will produce water spots under the right
conditions.

When you are ready to dry the car, take the nozzle off the hose and place it over the horizontal
surfaces of the car, allowing the water to run down the sides, taking any remaining suds, dirt,
and yes, WATER with it. If you spray the car with the nozzle, this will leave lots of water drops
all over the carâ€Šparticularly if the car is well waxedâ€Šand all this will do is
make it more difficult to dry the car. If there isnâ€™t a lot of standing water left on the
paint, you will only need one towel. If youâ€™re in a rush and canâ€™t wait for the
car to drip dry for a few minutes, youâ€™ll need two towels.

Whatever you do, donâ€™t take the car out on the road to dry it if you intend to follow
through with the remaining detailing steps because youâ€™ll just make the car dirty
again and that will require another wash!

Drying properly is all about drying the car while minimizing physical contact with the paint.
Unfold the towel and drape it over one side of a particular section of the surface. With one hand
at the far end of the towel and the other closer to you, gently â€œwalkâ€� the towel
across the surface.

Do NOT ball up the towel or apply pressure through the towel, particularly on the horizontal
surfaces (with vertical surfaces, itâ€™s unavoidable). The more pressure you exert,
the greater you risk scouring the clear in a very noticeable way.

Claying [1 hour, Only 1 or 2 times a year]



When I originally wrote this article, I thought claying was a waste of time. Having since done
it, I can say itâ€™s easily as effective (or more) than polishing when it comes to
cleaning and smoothing the finish to a mirror shine.

Detailing clay looks like modeling clay but is actually a form of mild abrasive suspended in a
sticky clay-like medium. The idea behind claying a car is to rub the clay over the surface
lubricated with quick-detailing spray or car wash soap diluted 15:1. The
â€œstickyâ€� qualities of the clay grab hold of impurities that have become
embedded in the surface of the paint and lift them out in a way that polishing cannot
accomplish.

The best analogy Iâ€™ve heard is this: Imagine your paint is a grass field with a bunch of
unsightly dandalions randomly spread about. Polishing the car is akin to mowing the field.
You may cut off the visible portion of the weeds, but the roots will remain. Claying is akin to
pulling the weed out by its roots. The end result of claying is a smooth surface ready to be
polished.

Claying should be done once, or â€” in harsh conditions â€” maybe twice a year. It
should also be done anytime the car comes out of the body shop, since most shops canâ€™t
seem to mask properly.

And speaking of body shops, if youâ€™re planning to have body work done on your car,
insist that they use a â€œliquid maskâ€�, which is a material they spray over the
areas of the car that will NOT be worked on in order to protect it from overspray. Any overspray
that does settle on the protected areas washes away with the mask when the material is removed
with water. The reason you have to ask for it is because most body shops donâ€™t use it due
to its high cost. Even if you have to pay extra for it, I highly recommend it because it will save
you from a very long and intensive detailing job.

Polishing (1 hour, 30 minutes)



The goal in polishing is to use fine abrasives to wear down the surface of the paint as required
to remove fine scratches (so-called â€œswirl marksâ€�). If the car has never been
polished before, it may be necessary to do one pass with a polish containing more aggressive
abrasives, then follow up with one or more passes using progressively finer abrasives.

For what itâ€™s worth, the first time I polished my 1998 BMW was in 2006 (eight years!). I
decided to use the mildest and best abrasive I could find â€“ Menzernaâ€™s Final
Polish II â€” and was stunned with the results. If youâ€™ve never polished a car
before, I would suggest you take it easy. Itâ€™s better to do more passes with a finer
abrasive than it is to do a single pass with an aggresive abrasive because more aggressive
abrasives can themselves induce swirl smarks, which (you guessed it) require a finer
abrasive to remove. I suppose the best advice I can give regarding polishing is to not be in a
rush. Done correctly, it doesnâ€™t take as much time as you might think.

I only apply polish by machine because doing it by hand is back-breaking work, and will never
produce the required heat and consistent pressure required for the job.

Glazing [30 minutes, optional]



While polishes physically remove defects, glazes merely hide defects using fillers.
Menzerna makes a glaze product called â€œFinishing Touch Glazeâ€� and I have tried
it. It does help mask some of the finer scratches that escape the polishing process, but at
least on my car the benefits did not really justify the extra time.

Sealing (30 minutes per coat)



Modern synthetic waxes are also called â€œsealantsâ€�, and with good reason. They
actually bond to the paint in a way that a natural wax such as carnauba cannot. The great thing
about a good sealant is that it will outlast carnauba wax by a factor of 5 or more as well as add
some UV protection, so if youâ€™re looking to reduce the number of times you need to
detail your car, sealing your paint is essential.

Unfortunately, good sealants cost money. The upside? A little goes a relatively long way,
particularly if itâ€™s applied by machine. Iâ€™ve settled on Menzernaâ€™s
Full Molecular Jacket (FMJ for short) because it goes on and comes off easily. I could not be
happier with the results.

FMJ can be applied by hand, but I use a buffer for consistent coverage. I remove FMJ with a towel
because itâ€™s easy to remove when dried and because I donâ€™t want to switch
buffing wheels every two seconds. Itâ€™s desireable to apply more than one coat of
sealant, but itâ€™s best to wait about 12 hours between coats so the prior coat fully
â€œcuresâ€�.

The perk of using a pure sealant, as opposed to some of the all-in-one polish/sealant
combinations is that pure sealants can be layered for greater protection and a richer shine.
My take is that more than two coats is a waste of time, particularly with FMJ because it looks
great with only a single coat.

Waxing [ Optional ]



Want to hear a revelation? If you use one or more coats of a good sealant like FMJ, there is no
reason to â€œwaxâ€� your car ever again. While some pros (and a lot of show-car
enthusiasts) insist on applying a top-coat of carnauba over a sealant to add shine or
â€œdepthâ€� to the paint, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s necessary for a daily
driver. In fact, I found it far more difficult to apply and remove the carnauba wax
consistently to produce the shine I already had with basically zero effort courtesy of FMJ. Of
course, if you choose another brand of sealant or carnauba, your mileage may vary.

If you want a good natural wax, you could try P21S. If you want to buy P21S for a reasonable price,
try purchasing it under the S100 name. Same stuff, half the price, but typically targeted to
motorcycle owners.

Incidentally, in addition to longevity issues, carnauba wax also has the disadvantage of
softening/melting at high temperatures (like when your car sits in the summer sun). When it
does this, any dirt that settles on the paint will embed itself in the wax coat. When the surface
temperature drops, the wax will harden and bond that dirt to your paint, dulling the finish.
Tell me â€” is that what you really want after you spent the better part of four+ hours
detailing your car?

Detailing The Interior



The best cleaner here is water, in this case applied with a couple dedicated towels that are
kept as clean as possible.

Routine cleaning of the interior involves nothing more than running a most towel over
everything, especially the seats and steering wheel â€” the areas that typically
receive the most dirt, and then using another towel to dry everything.

The only area of the interior that deserves special mention is the gauge cluster. AVOID
touching the clear plastic cover as much as possible, because no matter what you do, and no
matter how careful you are, you WILL put fine scratches in the plastic. I minimized the
potential damage by using my carnauba wax applicator and *carefully* putting some wax on the
plastic, and then using the clean dry towel to remove the wax. The result is that dust tends not
to stick to the surface, and future cleanings tend to scratch the wax layer, and not the
plastic.

One strong note of caution:before you apply wax to the clear plastic, I recommend you use blue
painterâ€™s tape to mask off the surrounding black plastic. If you get the tiniest bit of
wax on the surrounding plastic, youâ€™ll see it FOREVER, as there are no environmental
forces to wear away the wax.

One thing I do NOT use in the interior of the vehicle is Armor Allâ€Šnot only because I hate
that â€œshinyâ€� look, but because it does exactly the opposite of what it claims.
It does not â€œprotectâ€� the plasticâ€Šin fact the solvents in the product
tend to dry out plastic, so once you apply the stuff you have to apply it forever to keep it
looking good (great marketing strategy, eh?).

The only thing Armor All belongs on, in my opinion, is tires, and thatâ€™s the only manner
in which I use it. And, if you want to prove what Iâ€™ve just said to yourself, apply Armor
All to your tires on a regular basis for a few months, and then stop using it to see how your
sidewalls fade and turn a strange grayish or brownish color.

Conclusion



If you take away nothing else from this page, accept this small tidbit of wisdom:

AVOID BLACK CARS LIKE THE PLAGUE!



Even if you follow all of the techniques Iâ€™ve outlined above, and can devote several
hours every week to the process, a black car looks great for about 5 minutes. Thereafter, it
looks like crap until you get around the time, patience, andÂ  courage to work on it again.

Black paint is terribly unforgiving of sloppy cleaning and waxing technique. If you have
nothing to do every day but detail your car, buy one painted black. If you want to have a life, buy
a color that will better hide dirt and surface imperfections.

Your check book that is,

you see much too often I have to be the spoiler of your happiness, you just got the car you always
wanted and you told the whole world how great of a deal you got, and then your dream car needs an
oil change, being the only and exclusive BMW service & repair center in the A V you want to start
the best care for your bimmer.

Then when you pick your car up, regretfully I hand you the state of health and the findings of
your car’s conditions.

then you say ” but it runs great ” yeah I noticed a little oil leak and a little clunk noise,
” but the guy said is was minor” you see those minor repairs could be minor to one of the
Forbes magazine inductees, but to the general working class, it could kill your check book.

What I’m trying to say is, before you buy any used car have it checked up by an expert in the
brand you’re buying

if it’s a BMW or Mini you will will thank me for your peace of mind and we’ll be friends or
you’ll hate me for spoiling your happiness.

and remember “It’s better to ask a dumb question than make a dumb mistake”

Mr Bimmer
