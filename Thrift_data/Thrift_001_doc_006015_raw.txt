Western anti-imperialists go home!







Above: animation byÂ  Noureddin Zarrinkelk for UNICEF. Hereâs an earlier film by him. And a
short item on his recent visit Â to Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. _

On Iran and the Kitsch Left, this is my favourite of the posts Iâve read recently:Â  The
Eighteenth Brumaire of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by Dave Osler.

More on that theme by Bob From Brockley: Iran and the left, continued , and Iran, drawing clear
lines . See also Norman Geras ,Â  Peter Ryley ,Â  Terry Glavin Â and Francis Sedgemore .

In contrast, UCU does something right , from Martin, and a declaration of support for the
protesters signed by Noam Chomsky even, along with very many others. (Via Bob .) _

Another recent item that stood out was by former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, onÂ  the
prescience of protest . (Via Norm .) An excerpt: People in free societies watching massive
military parades or vociferous displays of love for the leaders of totalitarian regimes
often conclude, "Well, that's their mentality; there's nothing we can do about it." Thus they
and their leaders miss what is readily grasped by local dissidents attuned to what is
happening on the ground: the spectacle of a nation of double-thinkers slowly or rapidly
approaching a condition of open dissent.



To see the telltale signs, sometimes it helps to have experienced totalitarianism
firsthand. More than once in recent years, former Soviet citizens returning from a visit to
Iran have told me how much Iranian society reminded them of the final stages of Soviet
communism. Their testimony was what persuaded me to write almost five years ago that Iran was
extraordinary for the speed with which, in the span of a single generation, a citizenry had
made the transition from true belief in the revolutionary promise into disaffection and
double-thinking. Could dissent be far behind? _

A lot has been written on the leading role of women in the protests, see for example links
provided by Norm Â andÂ  Martin . See also Roger Cohen in The New York Times: Iranâs second
sex . The closing paragraph: I asked one woman about her fears. She said sometimes she imagines
an earthquake in Tehran. She dashes out but forgets her hijab. She stands in the ruins, hair
loose and paralyzed, awaiting her punishment. And she looked at me wide-eyed as if to say: do
you understand, does the world understand our desperation? And hereâs Roger Cohen
answering questions on his reporting from Iran, including criticism of his writings prior to
the stealing of the election. For myself I find that criticism overdone . _

Background: from The New Yorker, February 2nd 2009, The Rationalist Â by Laura Secor, on a
dissident economistâs attempts to reform the Iranian revolution.

See also her most recent New Yorker news blog contribution,Â  Burning silence in Iran , on how
events are being driven not by the splits at the top, but by momentum from below. _

Updates at The New York Times news blog fromÂ  yesterday Â andÂ  today .

Stone City



Image: http://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/blogpix5/pigeon_s.jpg

I recently produced a bit of Flash animation and other art for the website of Stone City Films .
The redesign was timed to coincide with the broadcast of their latest production, Casualty
1909. (The first episode aired on BBC 1 on the 14th, but distracted as Iâve been, this post
comes a couple of weeks late.) The series is set in the Royal London Hospital, sketched here .Â 

This was my first attempt at Flash. I donât even have an up to date version of the program, so
the animation wasÂ createdÂ in Illustrator instead.

Related posts here .



Update April 2012: The Stone City Films website has since been redesigned, but you can still
see the animated pigeons here . Posted by kellie at 13:17 0 comments

In fear of the people - 13

More on the aftermath of Iranâs stolen election.

Today there is a protest at the Iranian Embassy in London organised by the Trades Uunion
Congress and Amnesty International, as part of an international day of action in solidarity
with the people of Iran.

Friday 26 June, 12.30 -1.30pm, Iranian embassy, 16 Princeâs Gate, London SW7 1PT.



Details on the TUC site .

Some of the other events around the world are listed by the International Transport
Workersâ Federation .

See also Jams and Bob .

The above illustration is by Brian Stauffer, created for the NYT Week in Review. You can read
more on how it came about atÂ  his Drawger blog .

Image copyright Â© Brian Stauffer.

The Guardian News Blog has not posted on Iran today. The New York Times blog has updates , but
much less than previous days. On BBC News, Jeremy Bowen reports on the eerie calm in Tehran . His
closing paragraph: When you ask Iranians about the way this might go, a phrase keeps cropping
up. They say it might seem quiet to an outsider, but there is fire below the ashes.

In fear of the people - 12



At DSTPFW:Â  Slavoj ÃÅiÃÅ¸ek on Iran .

Also from that corner, Shuggy writes on Iran and the power of democracy . He has two reasons for
believing that âthe turmoil in Iran demonstrates the power of democracy.â The first is
that he thinks âall the talk of 'sham-elections' that provide a facade for dictatorship
omits an important question: why do dictatorships feel the need to provide such a cloak of
legitimacy to their rule in the first place?â The second is that âsham elections and
emasculated parliaments have a habit of gaining a life and assuming a role that exceeds the
intention of their creators. Consider the Duma, created as a fig-leaf for Romanov imperial
power but which outlived not only them but the USSR itself.â

Read the whole argument . As mentioned earlier , others have had similar thoughts.

In fear of the people - 11

Normblog: Iran x 9 .



Azarmehr: More defections from the Revolutionary Guards .



Roland Dodds: McCain is wrong about the Iranian upheaval .

From last week, Stephen Kinzer onÂ Muhammad Mossadeq .

On that last one, I have no idea if the use of Mossadeqâs image by protesters that he describes
is widespread, and while his reading of its meaning is probably correct as far as it goes, it
also seems rather narrow. The invocation of Mossadeq seems more likely a signal directed
internally rather than externally, as a claiming of national history by the protesters
rather than a message to Obama on intervention.

Other signals clearly are directed externally, namely the flood of english language
messages, via the net, and displayed by marching protesters. These people obviously do want
engagement, though as the population in Iran are showing themselves to be the centre of
ultimate power, so the greatest power for supporting their fight internationally is
probably not in the hands of international political leaders, but in the hands of the people at
large. Still, leaders do have a role to play, in not recognising the election, and in the clear
declaration of principles that go beyond partisanship.

Shipbuilding



Image: http://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/blogpix5/ark_s.jpg

This is from about seven years ago, one of my first attempts at painting in Photoshop. Itâs a
concept image for a musical of Noahâs Ark that Jim Hensonâs Creature Shop were developing
with Leslie Bricusse. The pitch book contained work by about five different artists.

Iâd earlier drawn another ship for the Creature Shop, a pirate brig for a show of Peter Pan
staged in Australia. That vessel was designed to be built in forced perspective, looming over
the audience as it sailed onstage. Iâve never seen any good photos of how it worked out,
though a glimpse can be caught at the bottom of this page . Posted by kellie at 04:36 0 comments

A talk by David Kilcullen



Part of the Authors@Google series, this is an hour long, so too much to summarise, but to
encourage you to listen hereâs some of what he covers:

He gives a clear explanation of the main theme of his book, The Accidental Guerilla, on how the
wrong war-fighting strategies make insurgencies worse. He talks about recent American and
British mistakes in counter-insurgency, at one point paying particular attention to the
British experience in Basra. He praises the Danish military in Afghanistan, which is nice to
hear. He also talks of how aid projects need to be informed by counter-insurgency thinking in
order to be effective. And he talks about Pakistan, and the insurgency there that scares him
much more than Iraq or Afghanistan.

Now your essay topic for this week: what would a proper counter-insurgency approach to Gaza
look like? Hint: containing the population together with the enemy, thus allowing the enemy
to consolidate its control of the population, that is not it.

experience in Afghanistan. Posted by kellie at 02:51 0 comments

Pity the poor Stalinists . . .

Â . . . as they hollow out the meanings of words, their cynicism hollows out whatâs left of
their humanity.

The Nazis had it easy. No inherent contradiction between word and deed for them. They held the
majority of the human race to be less than fully human, and acted accordingly. Even lies were
honest enough once they had openly declared their total contempt for others, for by what right
then could anyone expect anything other than contemptuous lies? Ah, the simple life of a Nazi.

But pity the poor Stalinists, who had to maintain that their suppression of the masses was for
the good of the masses. The deepest cynicism must have been necessary for them to function,
with all their powers of reason devoted to a dishonest justification of the unjustifiable.
What damage that cynicism must have done to individual minds.

Perhaps in some that cynicism took on a life of its own. Perhaps thatâs why when making
excuses for the USSR fell out of fashion, some moved on to making excuses for other tyrannies,
other murderous organisations.

Perhaps thatâs why some felt compelled to justify the IRAâs deliberate targeting of
civilians, in a campaign that went against the will of all but a minority within a minority
within a minority.Â 

Perhaps thatâs why some have so much to say about American bombers in Iraq and Afghanistan,
and so little about suicide bombers.

Perhaps thatâs why some wish to look the other way when a tyrant who talks the talk of
anti-imperialism is revealed as a fraud.

Perhaps thatâs why some prefer to denigrate and smear a people who risk their own lives in
pursuit of their democratic rights.

And perhaps thatâs why some canât speak of democracy without disparaging it. Oh,
certainly, democracy has none of the perfection of their long-ago promised utopias, but that
is democracyâs strength: it is not utopian. It is designed to fail, to correct, to fail
again, to correct again. Thatâs why a phrase like âdemocratic fundamentalismâ is
nonsense. Democracy is inherently incrementalist, designed for imperfection. Utopia is
inhuman. But of course, they knew that already, the cynics. Posted by kellie at 16:32 9

In fear of the people - 7

Updates on the Iranian regimeâs attacks upon their people today: The New York Times , The
Guardian , Raye Man Kojast ,Â  Azarmehr , Andrew Sullivan , Jeff Weintraub ,Â  BBC News . _

Today I heard two unconnected friends in London say they thought Ahmadinejad probably had the
support of the majority in Iran, though perhaps not to the degree claimed in the official
results. However the suggestion that the protests are just by a well-to-do urban elite, and
that thereâs an unseen rural majority supporting the regime, has been repeatedly
debunked. Some of these articles have been linked to on other blogs, but for anyone who missed
them here they are again:

On monday The Washington Post published an article arguing that telephone poll data showed
the election results might actually reflect the will of the Iranian people, inÂ Â  The
Iranian People Speak by Ken Ballen and Patrick Doherty. But Gary Langer, Director of Polling
at ABC News demonstratesÂ  why their conclusions werenât supported by the poll data , and
points to the fact that they had earlier reached conflicting conclusions based on the very
same poll.

The same flaws in the Post article are highlighted byÂ  Juan Cole , professor of modern Middle
Eastern and South Asian history at the University of Michigan and author of Â âEngaging the
Muslim World.â

Iranâs Rural Vote and Election Fraud by Eric Hooglund,Â professor of politics at Bates
College, Lewiston, Maine, and editor of the journal Middle East Critique. An expert on Iran,
his most recent publication is âThirty Years of Islamic Revolution in Rural Iranâ in
Middle East Report, no. 250, Spring 2009.

Ahmadinejadâs Rural Votes by Nate Silver,Â a statistician whose predictions during the
2008 US campaign outperformed every established pollster . He demonstrates that
Ahmadinejadâs core support in the 2005 election was urban, not rural. For more graphs
comparing the 2005 and 2009 results, see The Guardian News Blog Â (scroll down).

Why Tehran Matters by Laura SecorÂ of The New Yorker. An excerpt: It is true that the movements
of American reporters in Iran are controlled and curtailed to the point where Tehran is the
main, if not the only, point of access, apart from the hard-line holy city of Qom. I cannot speak
for all American journalists who report from Iran, but Iâm sure Iâm not the only one who is
acutely aware of, and frustrated by, the lack of insight into the rural heartland this affords
us. The best that we can do is to familiarize ourselves with the full spectrum of urban life,
across class and cultural boundaries. Most Iranians, after all, live in cities, of which
Tehran is only the most gigantic.



It is from this reporting that I have written, in this magazine and elsewhere, that the urban
poor had ceased to be a reliable constituency for Ahmadinejad. They were in 2005. But by 2006,
it was hard to find a South Tehrani who was pleased with the outcome of that vote or prepared to
vote for him again. Why? Because under Ahmadinejad, the countryâs economic crisis
deepened in ways that hit urban populationsâboth the poor and the middle classâharder
than anyone.



Ahmadinejadâs 2005 mandate was an economic one. Those who wish to argue that Western
reporters, in their narcissism, have simply overlooked the widespread enthusiasm for the
incumbent, need to explain the outcome of the 2008 parliamentary elections, which were
carried by conservatives who were fiercely critical of Ahmadinejadâs economic policies
and worked hard to distance themselves from him. These were elections that did not even
include any reformist candidates, let alone lure a large North Tehrani vote. Read the rest
here . Again Juan Cole covers similar territory, with additional detail, here .

In fear of the people - 6



Image: http://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/blogpix5/edel_rodriguez.jpg

An illustration in the New York Times earlier this week. On his Drawger blog, artist Edel
Rodriguez shows some of the work process behind the image .

Art copyright Â© Edel Rodriguez 2009.

Todayâs updates from The New York Times ,Â  The Guardian , Raye Man Kojast , and Andrew
Sullivan , and a press roundup from the SWJ .

Also recently updated: ModernityBlog ,Â  Azarmehr , Jeff Weintraub , Michael Totten .

UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband yesterday: âA proud people wants to decide its own
future. We should defend that.â

Background: Via Global Dashboard , the BBC documentary Iran and the West . Episode 1, The Man
Who Changed the World, clips one ,Â  two ,Â  three ,Â  four ,Â  five , andÂ  six . Episode 2, The
Pariah State, Â  clips one , two , three , four , five , and six . Episode 3, Nuclear
Confrontation, clipsÂ  one ,Â  two ,Â  three ,Â  four ,Â  five , andÂ  six .Â  _

As the regime threatens a more extreme crackdown, Harryâs Place reports on the UK
governmentâsÂ  forced deportation to Iran of a convert . This concerns an Iranian accused
of apostasy , a âcrimeâ punishable by death in Iran. The UK Government had first attempted
to deport him on a commercial flight to Tehran on June 9th, but the pilot refused to take him .

Here is Melvyn Kohnâs account of how he sought help from Brian Iddon , Labour Member of
Parliament for Bolton South East: So he will not be emailing MP Brian Iddon anymore with his
desperate pleas. What we thought would be a good move turned out to be a waste of time. Iddon, in
emails sent to a colleague, rather than getting the young man released, spent his time
speculating on his motives - and went so far as to reply to one reader of this site that the young
man was not doing much to help himself. I had to go over the case point by point to undo the damage.
Let me reply to Iddonâs nonsense here as well: the man was a genuine Christian and had entered
the country legally. Iddon, you had a duty to help him, not ask inane questions. Precious time
was wasted. Why were you so unhelpful? You eventually put a caseworker on to it, who did call
Harmondsworth, but why stop there? The buck stops way above Harmondsworth. There was no
mention of any attempt to contact Phil Woolas - a step other MPs are on record as having taken
(John McDonnell for instance, in regards the case posted to this site on 6 June). Your
caseworker was asked this quesion earlier this afternoon in an email.



It may well be a rhetorical question. The young man is gone. You are still here. And I hope that
soon you too are gone. Thanks for nothing. Hereâs more on Brian Iddon MP and friends . Posted

In fear of the people - 5







Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Marjane Satrapi speaking on Wednesday at the European Parliament in
Brussels on behalf of the Moussavi campaign. More details at The New York Times .

_

In the previous post I noted that The Guardian was the only UK national paper to lead on Iran
yesterday. The paperâs news blog has also been excellent at providing rolling coverage.
See here for todayâs updates.

However, as Norm points out , the paperâs leading Stalin apologist Seumas Milne has proved
as reliably wrong as ever. Like Galloway , it seems Milne never met an âanti-imperialistâ
he didnât like, no matter how murderous. Milne was The Guardianâs comment editor from
2001 to â07 and is currently an associate editor. A paper that pays Milneâs salary is a
paper I would be embarrassed to spend money on. _

More from today: From Martin, We just want to be normal, ctd. Â  From ModernityBlog, Not just
rich kids in Iran . Todayâs updates from The New York Times . _

On the broader implications of events in Iran:

The Poor Mouth points to an article from AP on reaction in the Arab world .

Andrew Sullivan on making the Russian connection , follow up here , and here .

Talking of Russia and Caspian Sea oil and gas, if relations between Iran and the West change
considerably, it would make the Russian threat to the Caucasus fuel route via Georgia much
less critical.

Michael Totten on the view from Beirut .

A lot of focus has been put on what these events might mean for Israel regarding the Iranian
regimeâs support for Hamas and Hizbollah, its threats regarding Israelâs existence,
its promotion of Holocaust denial, and its nuclear weapons programme. However another
aspect to consider is the lesson that it is not Iranâs population that is the problem, in fact
they are showing themselves to be the solution. There might be something to learn here
regarding how security is to be achieved for Israel closer to home. Posted by kellie at 01:36 0

Imposing democracy

I fell into an argument with friends and acquaintances on Iraq and Afghanistan this
afternoon. The word which lit the fuse was democracy. As in, itâs wrong to âimpose
democracyâ. This phrase seems obviously nonsense to me. On whom is democracy being
imposed? The people who voted in Iraqâs January 2005 legislative Â and governorate
elections ? Iraqâs October 2005 constitutional referendum ? Iraqâs December 2005
legislative election ? Iraqâs January 2009 governorate elections ? Or perhaps has it been
imposed on the people who voted in Afghanistanâs 2004 presidential election ? Or
Afghanistanâs 2005 parliamentary election ?

Those voters were not forced to vote. They voted despite genuine threats of attacks at polling
stations. Democracy was not imposed upon them, it was claimed by them in defiance of deadly
terrorists.



The only people on whom democracy is imposed are the murdering thugs who would prefer to rule by
force.

My apologies to anyone who finds this question a bit stale. Itâs on such a kindergarten level
I was surprised to still be faced with it. There are much more complicated and challenging
issues in both wars. And yet, this kindergarten concept of âimposing democracyâ turned
up in the news very recently, out of the mouth of one famed for his mastery of rhetoric. In his
Cairo speech President Obama said, explicitly in reference to Iraq, âlet me be clear: no
system of government can or should be imposed on one nation by any other.â Which is a red
herring. Iraqâs system of government was approved in a referendum by 79% of voters on a 63%
turnout, in a ballot supervised by the UN. It was the choice of the Iraqi nation.

There is reason to welcome Obamaâs statement, however, because itâs not that long ago
that his proposalsÂ on Iraq sounded an awful lot like a plan to, erm, impose a different system
of government. _

Related reading: Peter Baker on Obama and democracy, NYT June 8th , a sequel to his February
22nd piece on the same subject. He provides the curious spectacle of an administration
anxious that the notion of democracy promotion will associate them with the Bush presidency.
I donât get it. Obama seems globally to be the most popular American president in history.
Democracy is an idea millenia older than Bush, an idea that gives courage to millions. What is
the White House worried about?

Democracy is central to Obamaâs appeal. He should embrace it unambiguously. What I liked
about The New Yorkerâs inauguration cover by Drew Friedman was that it placed Obamaâs
election as part of the continuity of Americaâs unfinished revolution. Unfinished,
because democracy means a never-ending revolution, the strongest political system yet
known in this universe of constant change. Posted by kellie at 17:58 1 comments

Exactly wrong

The xenophobes and protectionists who argue that immigrants cost jobs have it exactly wrong.
Newcomers create jobs and they always have. A report by the Center for an Urban Future recently
described immigrants as âentrepreneurial sparkplugs,â and the reason is obvious. If
they weren't risk-takers, they wouldn't be here. Steven V Roberts writing in The Washington
Post, via TPM Barnettâs blog . However the main subject of the piece is not economic migrants
but refugees, as heâs reviewing Outcasts United by Warren St John, a book about a soccer team
in Clarkston, Georgia, made up of refugees from a dozen different countries. Beatrice Ziaty
and her children (three sons played for the Fugees) fled out the back door of their house in
Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, as her husband was being killed in the front room. Most
immigrants to America come eagerly, after years of saving and scheming; they stay in touch
with kinfolk back home via cell phones and e-mail and retain a sense of connection and
community. The refugees of Clarkston were uprooted against their will. âThere's no point
in thinking about where to go back to,â said Paula Balegamire, whose husband languished in a
Congolese prison, âbecause there's nowhere to go back to.â

Back in the UK:Â  related from Mick Hartley. Reminds me of . . .





Woodyâs focus is firmly on kinetic operations. Such tactics sometimes have a place, but
only as part of a more comprehensive strategy. Hereâs an extract from Principles of Modern
American Counterinsurgency: Evolution and Debate , a paper by Janine Davidson at The
Brookings Institution. It seems an earlier draft of this may have played a role in the
evolution of the successful candidate last year.



First principle of a successful COIN campaign:

(I) A long-term political strategy focused on creating a viable, sustainable stability
âÂ through building or enhancing local government effectiveness and legitimacy
âÂ while marginalizing insurgents and winning over their sympathizers. Building
theÂ political legitimacy and effectiveness of the government, in the eyes of its people and
theÂ international community, is fundamental. Political reform and development
represent theÂ hard core of any counterinsurgency strategy, and provides a framework for
programs andÂ initiatives. In parallel, the political strategy is designed to undermine
support forÂ insurgents, win over their sympathizers to the government side, and co-opt
localÂ community leaders to ally themselves with the government. This seems highly
relevant to current challenges in the UK.

Update: Kilcullen on tackling extremism in Europe. Heâs talking about one flavour, but
surely the principles are the same for dealing with more familiar forms of fascism. Also, Your
Friend in the North on how not to do it. Posted by kellie at 16:54 0 comments

Liberal incrementalism

An incrementalist is someone who thinks that putting one foot in front of the other is the
better approach if they want to go out for a drink, rather than staying in and waiting for the
invention of a teleportation machine.

It seems a number of those commenting on this HP post would prefer to stay indoors with the
curtains closed, arguing that the impossibility of teleportation means venturing out is out
of the question.

Faking it again

Aristotle had some interesting advice for tyrants on how to prolong their rule. He described
two basic approaches: the first was the familiar path of force,Â surveillance,
andÂ censorship, treating the population as hostile and seeking to prevent them from being
able to revolt, but the second approach was to imitate as near as possible a just and benevolent
ruler, to keep the population content enough not to revolt.

In reality most tyrannies feature a mixture of the two approaches.

In the comments to this post at Azarmehrâs blog on the upcoming elections in Iran, there is
consensus that these elections, like the previous ones under the current theocratic regime,
will be neither free nor fair, that they are an imitation of democracy staged to keep the
population content. However, one of the commenters argues that in order to succeed, this
imitation of democracy must in every election cycle provide a closer and closer
approximation of the real thing, gradually escaping the control of the regime.

The only constant is change. Eventually, then, the transformation to democracy must come.
That, or the regime must turn back to the first approach described by Aristotle, undisguised
force. Posted by kellie at 13:56 3 comments
