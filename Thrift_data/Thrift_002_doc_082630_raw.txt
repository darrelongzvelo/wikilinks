Ryan responsible for Tipperary mess

Posted on August 26, 2012 by diarmaidwilliams Reply



The main reason Kilkenny beat Tipp last Sunday was down to hunger. That hunger, and not any
particular tactic, was the big difference between the sides.

But hunger, as John Giles likes to say, is a starting point, and its absence indicates a deeper
malaise.

Brian Cody and Declan Ryan – contrasting fortunes

For me the buck has to stop with the management, and thatâ€™s a hard thing to write about a
rookie management thatâ€™s won back to back Munster titles.

But Declan Ryan and his management team have now been shown up on both occasions that they have
faced the ultimate test against Kilkenny. If they pitched their wits against Cody ten more
times I think theyâ€™d still fall short.

Tipp havenâ€™t been right since the changing of the managerial guard (as mentioned in a
previous blog ) â€“ the hungry, intelligent, winning psychology they had in 2010 is
absent. Worst of all the beautiful ability to find space, that fantastic movement that
expressed the talents of their forward line seemed to have been cast aside by Ryan and his
advisers. Itâ€™s hard to credit it!

Whatever can-do motivation Sheedy and Oâ€™Shea managed to engrain in Tipperary
players seem to have been lost under this management.

Babs Keating has come in and had a go at the players and yes perhaps more leadership could have
been provided between the white lines.

But Babs has got a blind spot- his own managerial career shows he is a man whose judgement seems
to have gone south since the heady days of the 87-91 period.

Babs offers his full support , cheerleading for Tipp against Kilkenny

Itâ€™s never really tallied for him that two of the teams he managed have gone on to win
All-Irelands under others after disastrous stints under him.

Heâ€™s not up to the demands of modern hurling management and malicious barbs from the
media sidelines are unbecoming.

Babs is one of a breed who will always look to place the blame on players. Perhaps he is an
emotional man that lets those emotions cloud his judgement but making it personal against Lar
Corbett (saying heâ€™ll never attend a match if heâ€™s picked) is not the way to go.

Keating is an astute enough pundit and called the match very accurately in his Sun column match
preview . Maybe he should stick to that, and leave it to a psychologist to deal with this
deep-seated need to denigrate others.

Two things about the Lar-Tommy Walsh- Jackie Tyrell â€“Burke mess on Sunday. There
seems to be a perception that (a.) Lar Corbett took it upon himself to pursue this tactic, a
feeling that it indicates an overbearing influence in the dressing room. There is also the
much more plausible scenario that (b.) Ryan sent Corbett out to play this tactic.

If itâ€™s (a.), Ryan is to blame â€“ as an inter-county manager, how would he be so
weak as to allow a player to dictate to him the terms of battle? And if itâ€™s (b.), well
itâ€™s also Declan that must stand accountable, because the tactic was persisted with
long after it should have been shelved.

Hindsight is a great thing but perhaps when the plan started to unravel he could have advised
Corbett to alternate between full forward and midfield.

With two of Tippâ€™s most dangerous players neutralised it made Kilkennyâ€™s day
all the easier.

“But Tommy… I just want us to be friends!”

There has been a lot of old school bashing of tactics, but if your team doesnâ€™t have a
sequence of plans, or a method to their game, then you might as well be an ostrich with your head
buried head in the sand.

The sean scoil were fiercely critical of Davy for Clareâ€™s short passing game, and of
course it is over elaborate at times, but possession is nine points of the law, and Tipp
appeared to completely ignore that against the cats.

The amount of ball ballooned high out of the Tipperary defence was criminal and punished
persistently. It was like something from the 80â€™s and before.

You could argue that it was that sheer Kilkenny hunger that forced Tipp to hit bad ball to their
forwards but if Ryan had conditioned his players to play more of a possession type game under
intensity, Kilkenny wouldnâ€™t have had anything like that dominance.

The second half was a crucible of nightmares for Tipp, something like what we, in Clare, had to
endure in 93 and Kilkenny themselves experienced against Galway this year.

But at least Kilkenny never gave up against Galway and therein is the essence of it.

At the end of the game and Tipp umpteen points down, the men in blue and gold were inexplicably
taking facile points.

If there were any true guidance emanating from the sideline, everyone would have been told
with ten minutes to go that only goals would do.

At least then Tipp would have had the satisfaction of dying with their boots on, instead of
spinelessly shooting tepid scores.

Look at Cody. He may be an articulate, well-balanced interviewee, but his face canâ€™t
mask the fire in him. There is a seething rage in that man, spite, a man that cannot handle his
side being tested, never mind overcome.

Managements mould their teams in their own image. Codyâ€™s team are proud,
fastidiously well-prepared, confident, intelligent, spiteful, driven, furious and
experienced.

On the basis of that display, Declan Ryan must be eccentric, haphazard, fearful, laid-back,
foolish and a little uncertain – to be charitable.

One good thing may come out of it for Tipp if they get their next management selection right and
that is they will draw deeply from Sundayâ€™s humiliation, just as surely as Cody drew
into a well of fury still not sated by last yearâ€™s revenge, and of course their Leinster
final horror.

Galwayâ€™s management are a different proposition and while there may be a feeling that
Kilkenny are unlikely to fall for the same ploy twice, something about Anthony
Cunninghamâ€™s style suggests an ability to adapt and improvise his team in a way that
seems beyond Tippâ€™s backroom.

Some feel Kilkenny will summon up the spirit of vengeance to roll over Galway, in the same way as
the Munster Champions were rolled over.

The Galway defence is still leaky in a way that would have been fatal if they had met Kilkenny
last Sunday, but if things havenâ€™t been resolved yet they wonâ€™t have gotten a
more alarming wake up call than the sight of Tipp being demolished.

But maybe Kilkenny have hit their peak too soon, and Cody has met an adversary he is genuinely
fearful of.

If so, I suspect the Liam McCarthy could be going across the Shannon for the first time since
1997, and another unique double for a â€˜weaker countyâ€™ over a
â€˜traditionalâ€™ foe.
