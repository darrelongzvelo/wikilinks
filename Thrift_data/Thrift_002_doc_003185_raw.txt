American football , known in the United States and Canada simply as football (Canada also has
its own slightly different version, Canadian football ), [ 1 ] is a competitive team sport
known for combining strategy with physical play. The objective of the game is to score points
by advancing the ball [ 2 ] into the opposing team's end zone . The ball can be advanced by
carrying it (a running play) or by throwing it to a teammate (a passing play). Points can be
scored in a variety of ways, including carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line,
catching a pass thrown over that goal line, kicking the ball through the goal posts at the
opponent's end zone, or tackling an opposing ball carrier within his end zone. The winner is
the team with the most points when the time expires.

The sport is also played outside the United States. National professional and collegiate
leagues exist in United Kingdom , Germany , Italy , [ 3 ] Switzerland , [ 4 ] Finland , Sweden , [ 5 ]
Japan , Mexico , Israel , [ 6 ] Spain , Austria , [ 7 ] and several Pacific Island nations. The
National Football League (NFL), the largest American professional football league in the
world, ran a developmental league in Europe from 1991â€“1992 and then from
1995â€“2006.

American football is closely related to Canadian football , but with significant
differences . Both sports originated from rugby football . The major forms of football in the
United States are collegiate football and professional football . There have been numerous
major professional football leagues in the U.S., but currently the only one in existence is
the NFL.

The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and
association football (called soccer in the United States). Both games have their origins in
varieties of football played in the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century, in which a ball is
kicked at a goal and/or run over a line. Also like soccer, American football has twenty two
players on the field of play. Furthermore, some player position references common to both
soccer and rugby football are used, such as the term "halfback" and "fullback".

American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby football , most
notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp , considered the "Father of American
Football". Among these important changes were the introduction of the line of scrimmage and
of down-and-distance rules. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, game play
developments by college coaches such as Eddie Cochems , Amos Alonzo Stagg , Knute Rockne , and
Glenn "Pop" Warner helped take advantage of the newly introduced forward pass .

The popularity of collegiate football grew as it became the dominant version of the sport for
the first half of the twentieth century. Bowl games , a college football tradition, attracted
a national audience for collegiate teams. Bolstered by fierce rivalries , college football
still holds widespread appeal in the US.

The origin of professional football can be traced back to 1892, with William "Pudge"
Heffelfinger's $500 contract to play in a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association
against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. The first Professional "league" was the Ohio League ,
formed in 1903, and the first Professional Football championship game was between the
Buffalo Prospects and the Canton Bulldogs in 1919. In 1920, the American Professional
Football Association was formed. The first game was played in Dayton, Ohio on October 3, 1920
with the host Triangles defeating the Columbus Panhandles 14â€“0. The league changed
its name to the National Football League (NFL) two years later, and eventually became the
major league of American football. Initially a sport of Midwestern industrial towns in the
United States, professional football eventually became a national phenomenon. Football's
increasing popularity is usually traced to the 1958 NFL Championship Game , a contest that has
been dubbed the "Greatest Game Ever Played". A rival league to the NFL, the American Football
League (AFL), began play in 1960; the pressure it put on the senior league led to a merger
between the two leagues and the creation of the Super Bowl , which has become the most watched
television event in the United States on an annual basis.

Field and players

  The numbers on the field indicate the number of yards to the nearest end zone.

American football is played on a field 360 by 160 feet (109.7 m Ã— 48.8 m). [ 12 ] The
longer boundary lines are sidelines , while the shorter boundary lines are end lines .
Sidelines and end lines are out of bounds. Near each end of the field is a goal line ; they are
100 yards (91.4 m) apart. A scoring area called an end zone extends 10 yards (9.1 m)
beyond each goal line to each end line. The end zone includes the goal line but not the end line. [
12 ] While the playing field is effectively flat, it is common for a field to be built with a
slight crownâ€”with the middle of the field higher than the sidesâ€”to allow
water to drain from the field.

Yard lines cross the field every 5 yards (4.6 m), and are numbered every 10 yards from each
goal line to the 50-yard line, or midfield (similar to a typical rugby league field). Two rows
of short lines, known as inbounds lines or hash marks , run at 1-yard (91.4 cm) intervals
perpendicular to the sidelines near the middle of the field. All plays start with the ball on or
between the hash marks. Because of the arrangement of the lines, the field is occasionally
referred to as a gridiron

At the back of each end zone are two goalposts (also called uprights ) connected by a crossbar
10 feet (3.05 m) from the ground. For high skill levels, the posts are 222 inches
(5.64 m) apart. For lower skill levels, these are widened to 280 inches (7.11 m).

Each team has 11 players on the field at a time. However, teams may substitute for any or all of
their players, if time allows, during the break between plays. As a result, players have very
specialized roles, and, sometimes (although rarely) almost all of the (at least) 46 active
players on an NFL team will play in any given game. Thus, teams are divided into three separate
units: the offense , the defense and the special teams .

Start of halves



    Similarly to association football , the game begins with a coin toss to determine which
    team will kick off to begin the game and which goal each team will defend. [ 13 ] The options
    are presented again to start the second half; the choices for the first half do not
    automatically determine the start of the second half. The referee conducts the coin toss
    with the captains (or sometimes coaches) of the opposing teams. The team that wins the
    coin toss has three options: [ 13 ]

    1 - They may choose whether to kick or receive the opening kickoff.

    

    2 - They may choose which goal to defend.

    

    3 - They may choose to defer the first choice to the other team and have first choice to start
    the second half.

    



Whatever the first team chooses, the second team has the option on the other choice (for
example, if the first team elects to receive at the start of the game, the second team can decide
which goal to defend).

At the start of the second half, the options to kick, receive, or choose a goal to defend are
presented to the captains again. The team which did not choose first to start the first half (or
which deferred its privilege to choose first) now gets first choice of options.

Game duration



A standard football game consists of four 15-minute quarters (12-minute quarters in
high-school football and often shorter at lower levels), [ 16 ] with a 12 minute half-time
intermission after the second quarter. [ 17 ] The clock stops after certain plays; therefore,
a game can last considerably longer (often more than three hours in real time), and if a game is
broadcast on television , TV timeouts are taken at certain intervals of the game to broadcast
commercials outside of game action. If an NFL game is tied after four quarters, the teams play
an additional period lasting up to 15 minutes. In an NFL overtime game, the first team that
scores wins, even if the other team does not get a possession; this is referred to as sudden
death . In a regular-season NFL game, if neither team scores in overtime, the game is a tie. In an
NFL playoff game, additional overtime periods are played, as needed, to determine a winner.
College overtime rules are more complicated and are described in Overtime (sport) .

Advancing the ball



Advancing the ball in American football resembles the six-tackle rule and the play-the-ball
in rugby league . The team that takes possession of the ball (the offense ) has four attempts,
called downs , in which to advance the ball 10 yards (9.1 m) toward their opponent's (the
defense 's) end zone. When the offense succeeds in gaining at least 10 yards, it gets a first
down , meaning the team has another set of four downs to gain yet another 10 yards or to score. If
the offense fails to gain a first down (10 yards) after 4 downs, the other team gets possession
of the ball at the point where the fourth down ended, beginning with their first down to advance
the ball in the opposite direction.

Except at the beginning of halves and after scores, the ball is always put into play by a snap .
Offensive players line up facing defensive players at the line of scrimmage (the position on
the field where the play begins). One offensive player, the center , then passes (or "snaps")
the ball backwards between his legs to a teammate behind him, usually the quarterback .

    Players can then advance the ball in two ways:

    1 - By running with the ball, also known as rushing .

    

    2 - By throwing the ball to a teammate, known as a forward pass or as passing the football.
    The forward pass is a key factor distinguishing American and Canadian football from
    other football sports. The offense can throw the ball forward only once during a down and
    only from behind the line of scrimmage. The ball can be thrown, pitched, handed-off, or
    tossed sideways or backwards at any time.

    



    A down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:

    - The player with the ball is forced to the ground (a tackle ) or has his forward progress
    halted by members of the other team (as determined by an official ).

    

    - A forward pass flies beyond the dimensions of the field ( out of bounds ) or touches the
    ground before it is caught. This is known as an incomplete pass . The ball is returned to the
    most recent line of scrimmage for the next down.

    

    - The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds.

    

    - A team scores.

    



Officials blow a whistle to notify players that the down is over.

Before each down, each team chooses a play , or coordinated movements and actions, that the
players should follow on a down. Sometimes, downs themselves are referred to as "plays."

Change of possession



    The offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things occurs:

    - The team fails to get a first downâ€” i.e., in four downs they fail to move the ball
    past a line 10 yards ahead of where they got their last first down (it is possible to be
    downed behind the current line of scrimmage, losing "yardage"). The defensive team
    takes over the ball at the spot where the 4th-down play ends. A change of possession in this
    manner is commonly called a turnover on downs , but is not credited as a defensive
    "turnover" in official statistics. Instead, it goes against the offense's 4th down
    efficiency percentage.

    

    - The offense scores a touchdown or field goal. The team that scored then kicks the ball to
    the other team in a special play called a kickoff .

    

    - The offense punts the ball to the defense. A punt is a kick in which a player drops the ball
    and kicks it before it hits the ground. Punts are nearly always made on fourth down (though
    see quick kick ), when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the
    other team at its current spot on the field (through a failed attempt to make a first down)
    and feels it is too far from the other team's goal posts to attempt a field goal.

    

    - A defensive player catches a forward pass. This is called an interception , and the
    player who makes the interception can run with the ball until he is tackled, forced out of
    bounds, or scores.

    

    - An offensive player drops the ball (a fumble ) and a defensive player picks it up. As with
    interceptions, a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled, forced
    out of bounds, or scores. Backward passes that are not caught do not cause the down to end
    like incomplete forward passes do; instead the ball is still live as if it had been
    fumbled. Lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as turnovers .

    

    - The offensive team misses a field goal attempt. The defensive team gets the ball at the
    spot where the previous play began (or, in the NFL, at the spot of the kick). If the
    unsuccessful kick was attempted from within 20 yards (18.3 m) of the end zone, the
    other team gets the ball at its own 20 yard line (that is, 20 yards from the end zone). If a
    field goal is missed or blocked and the ball remains in the field of play, a defensive
    player may pick up the ball and attempt to advance it.

    

    - While in his own end zone, an offensive ball carrier is tackled, forced out of bounds,
    loses the ball out of bounds, or the offense commits certain fouls. This fairly rare
    occurrence is called a safety .

    

    - An offensive ball carrier fumbles the ball forward into the opposing end zone, and then
    the ball goes out of bounds. This extremely rare occurrence leads to a touchback , with the
    ball going over to the opposing team at their 20 yard line (Note that touchbacks during
    non-offensive special teams plays, such as punts and kickoffs, are quite common).

    



Scoring



    A team scores points by the following plays:

        - A touchdown (TD) is worth 6 points. [ 17 ] It is scored when a player runs the ball into
        or catches a pass in his opponent's end zone. [ 17 ] A touchdown is analogous to a try in
        rugby. Unlike rugby, a player does not have to touch the ball to the ground to score; a
        touchdown is scored any time a player has possession of the ball while the ball is on or
        beyond the opponents' goal line (or the plane above it).

        - After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a try (which is also analogous to the
        conversion in rugby ). The ball is placed at the other team's 3-yard (2.7 m) line
        (the 2-yard (1.8 m) line in the NFL). The team can attempt to kick it over the
        crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for 1 point (an extra
        point or point-after touchdown (PAT) [ 18 ] ), or run or pass it into the end zone in the
        manner of a touchdown for 2 points (a two-point conversion ). In college football, if
        the defense intercepts or recovers a fumble during a one or two point conversion
        attempt and returns it to the opposing end zone, the defensive team is awarded the two
        points.

        

    

    

    - A field goal (FG) is worth 3 points, and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar
    and through the goal posts (uprights). [ 17 ] Field goals may be placekicked (kicked when
    the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate) or drop-kicked (extremely
    uncommon in the modern game, with only two successes in sixty-plus years in the NFL). A
    field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to
    the opponent's goal line, or, when there is little or no time left to otherwise score.

    

    - A safety , worth 2 points, is scored by the opposing team when the team in possession at the
    end of a down is responsible for the ball becoming dead behind its own goal line. For
    instance, a safety is scored by the "defense" if an offensive player is tackled, goes out
    of bounds, or fumbles the ball out of bounds in his own end zone. [ 17 ] Safeties are
    relatively rare. Note that, though even more rare, the team initially on "offense"
    during a down can score a safety if a player of the original defense gains possession of the
    ball in front of his own goal line and then carries the ball or fumbles it into his own end
    zone where it becomes dead. However, if the ball becomes dead behind the goal line of the
    team in possession and its "opponent" is responsible for the ball being there (for
    instance, if the defense intercepts a forward pass in its own end zone and the ball becomes
    dead before the ball is advanced out of the end zone) it is a touchback: no points are scored
    and the team last in possession keeps possession with a first down at its own 20 yard line.
    In college, in the extremely rare instance that a safety is scored on a try, it is worth only
    1 point.

    





Kickoffs and free kicks



Each half begins with a kickoff . Teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals.
The ball is kicked using a kicking tee from the team's own 30-yard (27 m) line in the NFL and
college football (as of the 2007 season). The other team's kick returner tries to catch the
ball and advance it as far as possible. Where he is stopped is the point where the offense will
begin its drive , or series of offensive plays. If the kick returner catches the ball in his own
end zone, he can either run with the ball, or elect for a touchback by kneeling in the end zone, in
which case the receiving team then starts its offensive drive from its own 20 yard line. A
touchback also occurs when the kick goes out-of-bounds in the end zone. A kickoff that goes
out-of-bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is a
foul, and the ball will be placed where it went out of bounds or 30 yards (27 m) from the
kickoff spot, depending on which is more advantageous to the opposite team. [ 19 ] Unlike with
punts, once a kickoff goes 10 yards and the ball has hit the ground, it can be recovered by the
kicking team. [ 19 ] A team, especially one who is losing, can try to take advantage of this by
attempting an onside kick . Punts and turnovers in the end zone can also end in a touchback .

After safeties, the team that gave up the points must free kick the ball to the other team from
its own 20 yard line. [ 20 ]



Penalties

Main article: Penalty (American football) Further information: American football rules

Fouls (a type of rule violation) are punished with penalties against the offending team. Most
penalties result in moving the football towards the offending team's end zone. If the penalty
would move the ball more than half the distance towards the offender's end zone, the penalty
becomes half the distance to the goal instead of its normal value.

Most penalties result in replaying the down. Some defensive penalties give the offense an
automatic first down. [ 21 ] Conversely, some offensive penalties result in loss of a down
(loss of the right to repeat the down). [ 21 ] If a penalty gives the offensive team enough
yardage to gain a first down, they get a first down, as usual.

If a foul occurs during a down, an official throws a yellow penalty flag near the spot of the
foul. When the down ends, the team that did not commit the foul has the option of accepting the
penalty, or declining the penalty and accepting the result of the down.



Variations



Variations on these basic rules exist, particularly touch and flag football , which are
designed as non-contact or limited-contact alternatives to the relative violence of
regular American football. In touch and flag football, tackling is not permitted. Offensive
players are "tackled" when a defender tags them or removes a flag from their body,
respectively. Both of these varieties are played mainly in informal settings such as
intramural or youth games. Another variation is "wrap", where a player is "tackled" when
another player wraps his arms around the ball carrier. Professional, intercollegiate, and
varsity-level high school football invariably use the standard tackling rules.

Another variation is with the number of players on the field. In sparsely populated areas, it
is not uncommon to find high school football teams playing nine-man football , eight-man
football or six-man football . Players often play on offense as well as defense. The Arena
Football League is a league that plays eight-man football, but also plays indoors and on a much
smaller playing surface with rule changes to encourage a much more offensive game.

Another variation often played by American children is called Catch and Run. In this game, the
children split into two teams and line up at opposite sides of the playing field. One side
throws the ball to the other side. If the opposing team catches the ball, that player tries to
run to the throwing teams touchdown without being tagged/tackled. If no one catches the ball
or if the player is tagged/tackled, then that team has to throw the ball to the opposing team.
This repeats until the game (or recess period) is deemed over.

Most football players have highly specialized roles. At the college and NFL levels, most play
only offense or only defense.



Offense

    

    - The offensive line (OL) consists of five players whose job is to protect the passer and
    clear the way for runners by blocking members of the defense. The lineman in the middle is
    the Center. Outside the Center are the Guards, and outside them are the Tackles. Except
    for the center, who snaps the ball to one of the backs, offensive linemen generally do not
    handle the ball.

    

    - The quarterback (QB) receives the snap from the center on most plays. He then hands or
    tosses it to a running back, throws it to a receiver or runs with it himself. The
    quarterback is the leader of the offense and calls the plays that are signaled to him from
    the sidelines.

    

    - Running backs (RB) line up behind or beside the QB and specialize in running with the
    ball. They also block, catch passes and, on rare occasions, pass the ball to others or even
    receive the snap. If a team has two running backs in the game, usually one will be a halfback
    (HB) (or tailback (TB)), who is more likely to run with the ball, and the other will usually
    be a fullback (FB), who is more likely to block.

    

    - Wide receivers (WR) line up near the sidelines. They specialize in catching passes,
    though they also block for running plays or downfield after another receiver makes a
    catch.

    

    - Tight ends (TE) line up outside the offensive line. They can either play like wide
    receivers (catch passes) or like offensive linemen (protect the QB or create spaces for
    runners). Sometimes an offensive lineman takes the tight end position and is referred to
    as a tackle eligible . [ 22 ]

    



At least seven players must line up on the line of scrimmage on every offensive play. The other
players may line up anywhere behind the line. The exact number of running backs, wide
receivers and tight ends may differ on any given play. For example, if the team needs only 1
yard, it may use three tight ends, two running backs and no wide receivers. On the other hand, if
it needs 20 yards, it may replace all of its running backs and tight ends with wide receivers.



Defense



    In contrast to members of the offense, the rules of professional football ( NFL Rulebook )
    and American college football NCAA Rulebook ) do not specify starting position,
    movement, or coverage zones for members of the defensive team, except that they must be in
    the defensive zone at the start of play. The positions, movements and responsibilities
    of all defensive players are assigned by the team by selection of certain coverages, or
    patterns of placement and assignment of responsibilities. The positional roles are
    customary. These roles have varied over the history of American football. The following
    are customary defensive positions used in many coverages in modern American football.

    - The defensive line consists of three to six players who line up immediately across from
    the offensive line. They try to occupy the offensive linemen in order to free up the
    linebackers, disrupt the backfield (behind the offensive line) of the offense, and
    tackle the running back if he has the ball before he can gain yardage or the quarterback
    before he can throw or pass the ball. They are the first line of defense.

    

    - Behind the defensive line are the linebackers . They line up between the defensive line
    and defensive backs and may either rush the quarterback or cover potential receivers.

    

    - The last line of defense is known as the secondary, comprising at least three players who
    line up as defensive backs , who are either cornerbacks or safeties . They cover the
    receivers and try to stop pass completions. They occasionally rush the quarterback.

    





Special teams



The units of players who handle kicking plays are known as special teams . Three important
special-teams players are the punter , who handles punts, the placekicker or kicker, who
kicks off and attempts field goals and extra points, and the long snapper , who snaps the ball
for extra points, field goals, and punts. Also included on special teams are the returners.
These players return punts or kickoffs and try to get in good field position. These players can
also score touchdowns.



Uniform numbering

Quarterback Shaun Carney has uniform number 5.

    In the NFL, ranges of uniform numbers are (usually) reserved for certain positions: [ 23 ]

    - 1â€“9: Quarterbacks, kickers, and punters

    

    - 10â€“19: Quarterbacks, kickers, punters, and wide receivers

    

    - 20â€“49: Running backs and defensive backs (tight ends are also permitted to wear
    numbers in the range 40-49 if no numbers are available in the range 80-89)

    

    - 50â€“59: Centers and linebackers

    

    - 60â€“79: Offensive and defensive linemen

    

    - 80â€“89: Wide receivers and tight ends

    

    - 90â€“99: Defensive linemen and linebackers

    



NCAA and high school rules specify only that offensive linemen must have numbers in the 50-79
range, but the NCAA "strongly recommends" that quarterbacks and running backs have numbers
below 50 and wide receivers numbers above 79. This helps officials as it means that numbers 50
to 79 are ineligible receivers , or players that may never receive a forward pass. There are no
numbering restrictions on defensive players in the NCAA, other than that no two players with
the same jersey number can be on the field at the same time.



Basic strategy

Main article: American football strategy

Because the game stops after every down, giving teams a chance to call a new play, strategy
plays a major role in football. Each team has a playbook of dozens to hundreds of plays.
Ideally, each play is a scripted, strategically sound team-coordinated endeavor. Some
plays are very safe; they are likely to get only a few yards. Other plays have the potential for
long gains but at a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover.

Generally speaking, rushing plays are less risky than passing plays. However, there are
relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays. To deceive the other team, some
passing plays are designed to resemble running plays and vice versa. These are referred to as
play-action passes and draws, respectively. There are many trick or gadget plays, such as
when a team lines up as if it intends to punt and then tries to run or pass for a first down. Such
high-risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work. However, they can spell disaster
if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts accordingly.

The defense also plans plays in response to expectations of what the offense will do. For
example, a "blitz" (using linebackers or defensive backs to charge the quarterback) is often
attempted when the team on defense expects a pass. A blitz makes downfield passing more
difficult but exposes the defense to big gains if the offensive line stems the rush.

Many hours of preparation and strategizing, including film review by both players and
coaches, go into the days between football games. This, along with the demanding physicality
of football (see below), is why teams typically play at most one game per week.



Physicality

Main articles: Health issues in American football and American football protective
equipment

American football is a collision sport. To stop the offense from advancing the ball, the
defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking or pulling him down. As such,
defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball-carrier to the
ground, within certain rules and guidelines. Tacklers cannot kick or punch the runner. They
also cannot grab the face mask of the runner's helmet or lead into a tackle with their own
helmet. Despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary roughness, most other forms of
tackling are legal. Blockers and defenders trying to evade them also have wide leeway in
trying to force their opponents out of the way. Quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders
coming on full speed from outside the quarterback's field of vision. This is commonly known as
a blindside.

To compensate for this, players must wear special protective equipment, such as a padded
plastic helmet , shoulder pads , hip pads and knee pads . These protective pads were introduced
decades ago and have improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players. An
unintended consequence of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of
violence in the game. Players may now hurl themselves at one another at high speeds without a
significant chance of injury. The injuries that do result tend to be severe and often season or
career-ending and sometimes fatal. In previous years with less padding, tackling more
closely resembled tackles in Rugby football . Better helmets have allowed players to use
their helmets as weapons. This form of tackling is particularly unwise, because of the great
potential for brain or spinal injury . All this has caused the various leagues, especially the
NFL, to implement a complicated series of penalties for various types of contact. Most
recently, virtually any contact with the helmet of a defensive player on the quarterback, or
any contact to the quarterback's head, is now a foul. During the late 1970s, the penalty in high
school football for spearing included ejection from the game. [ 24 ]

Despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety, injuries remain very
common in football. It is increasingly rare, for example, for NFL quarterbacks or running
backs (who take the most direct hits) to make it through an entire season without missing some
time to injury. Additionally, 28 football players died from direct football injuries in the
years 2000-05 and an additional 68 died indirectly from dehydration or other examples of
"non-physical" dangers, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury
Research. [ 25 ] Concussions are common, with about 41,000 suffered every year among high
school players according to the Brain Injury Association of Arizona. [ 26 ] In 1981, U.S.
President Ronald Reagan , who played football in high school, commented on the contact of the
sport: "[Football] is the last thing left in civilization where men can literally fling
themselves bodily at one another in combat and not be at war." [ 27 ]

Extra and optional equipment such as neck rolls, spider pads, rib protectors (referred to as
"flak jackets"), and elbow pads help against injury as well, though they do not tend to be used
by the majority of players due to their lack of requirement.

The danger of football and the equipment required to reduce it make regulation football
impractical for casual play. Flag football and touch football are less violent variants of
the game popular among recreational players.



Nutrition and dehydration



Football players typically begin their season while the weather is still extremely warm and
with the dangerous combination of warm weather and high humidity, receiving dehydration is a
great risk taken by the players. [ 28 ] The players are usually required to follow a hydration
schedule. It is extremely important for players to drink enough fluids because dehydration
can seriously reduce athletic performance and increase the risk of heat illnesses. Most
trainers and coaches make it imperative for their players to drink fluids before they are
thirsty. [ 28 ]

Calendar



Traditionally, football is an autumn sport. A season typically begins in mid-to-late August
and runs through December, into January. The professional playoffs run through January, and
the Super Bowl is often played in the first week of February.

playing on Thanksgiving

The NFL draft is usually held in April, in which eligible college football players are
selected by NFL teams, the order of selection determined by the teams' final regular season
records.

It is a long-standing tradition in the United States (though not universally observed) that
high school football games are played on Friday night, college games on Saturday, and
professional games on Sunday.

In the 1970s, the NFL began to schedule one game on Monday nights . Beginning in 2006, the NFL
began scheduling games on Thursday and Saturday nights after the college football regular
season concludes in mid-November, aired on the NFL Network .

In recent years, nationally televised Thursday night college games have become a weekly
fixture on ESPN , and most nights of the week feature at least one college game, though most
games are still played on the traditional Saturday.

Certain fall and winter holidays â€”such as the NFL's Thanksgiving Classic and
numerous New Year's Day college bowl games â€”have traditional football games
associated with them.

Despite this, there are a few professional leagues that have played in the spring, mainly to
avoid competition with the established leagues. Examples include the now defunct XFL , the
United States Football League , and the proposed All American Football League . Indoor
football is played primarily in spring for this same reason.

At most levels of competition, college football teams hold several weeks of practices in the
spring. These practices typically end with an intramural scrimmage open to the public. In
certain areas, high school football teams also hold spring practices.



Outside the United States



Outside the United States, the sport is referred to as "American football" (or a translation
thereof) to differentiate it from other football codes such as association football
(soccer) and rugby football . In Australia and New Zealand the game is also known as gridiron
football , or more commonly as gridiron, although in the United States the term gridiron
refers only to the playing field itself. [ 29 ] In much of the world, the term football is
unambiguous and refers to association football.

The NFL has attempted to introduce the game to other nations and operated a developmental
league, NFL Europa , with teams in five German cities and one in the Netherlands, but this
league folded following the 2007 season. The professional Canadian Football League and
collegiate Canadian Interuniversity Sport play under the only slightly different Canadian
rules .

In the UK, 46 teams play in the British American Football League . The BAFL has three levels: The
Premier, of which there are five teams; BAFL 1, of which there are 19 teams; and BAFL 2, of which
there are 26 teams. While the lower level teams have their own championship games during
BritBowl Weekend, only Premier league teams face each other in the BritBowl which is it held in
Doncaster 's Keepmoat Stadium . Unlike the NFL, the BAFL season is played through the summer
(April to September), with the British university season spanning the autumn and winter.

In Mexico , the ONEFA is a college league with 26 teams in 3 conferences. It is the most important
championship in Latin America.

In Japan , the X-League is a professional league with 60 teams in four divisions, using
promotion and relegation . After the post-season playoffs, the X-League champion is
determined in the Japan X Bowl. There are also over 200 universities fielding teams, with the
national collegiate championship determined by the Koshien Bowl . The professional and
collegiate champions then face each other in the Rice Bowl to determine the national
champion.

In Germany, the German Football League whose elite division is called Bundesliga , has 12
teams partitioned into north and south conferences. The finalists from the playoffs
determine the German champion during the German Bowl .

In Hungary, 18 registered teams participate in a the MAFL 's two division league structure.
The sport has grown significantly since 2004 and with some top Division I teams participating
in the CEFL .

In Norway, div I consists of only two teams, Oslo Vikings and Eidsvoll 1814's . These two teams
also compete in the European Football League but they play an annual game for the Norwegian
Championship title. Norway has seven other teams that play in div II and this division is
looked upon as the Norwegian Football League .

The International Federation of American Football is the governing body for American
football with 45 member associations from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania.
The IFAF also oversees the American Football World Cup , which is held every four years. Japan
won the first two World Cups, held in 1999 and 2003. Team USA, which had not participated in the
previous World Cups, won the title in 2007.

Major American leagues have also held some regular season games outside of the United States.
On October 2, 2005, the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers played the first regular
season NFL game outside of the United States, in Mexico City's Estadio Azteca , [ 30 ] From 2007,
the NFL has played or has plans to play at least one regular season game outside of the United
States. The NCAA will also play games outside of the U.S. In 2012, The United States Naval
Academy will play the University of Notre Dame in Dublin, Ireland . [ 31 ]
