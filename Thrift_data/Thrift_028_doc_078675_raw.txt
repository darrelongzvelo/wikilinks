                                 DOES GOD EXIST?

example of the depiction of  God the Father in Western art .)

Many arguments which attempt to prove or disprove the existence of God have been proposed by
philosophers, theologians, and other thinkers for many centuries. In philosophical
terminology, such arguments concern schools of thought on the epistemology of the ontology
of God.

There are many philosophical issues concerning the existence of God. Some definitions of God
are sometimes nonspecific, while other definitions can be self-contradictory. Arguments
for the existence of God typically include metaphysical, empirical, inductive, and
subjective types, while others revolve around perceived holes in evolutionary theory and
order and complexity in the world . Arguments against the existence of God typically include
empirical, deductive, and inductive types. Conclusions reached include: "God does not
exist" ( strong atheism ); "God almost certainly does not exist" ( de facto atheism ); "no one
knows whether God exists" ( agnosticism ); "God exists, but this cannot be proven or
disproven" (weak theism ); and "God exists and this can be proven" (strong theism ). There are
numerous variations on these positions.

Some theologians, such as the scientist and theologian A.E. McGrath , argue that the
existence of God cannot be adjudicated on for or against by using scientific method . Agnostic
Stephen Jay Gould argues that science and religion are not in conflict and do not overlap. (
Non-overlapping magisteria ) Who is God? He's been described as everything from an
impersonal life-force to a benevolent, personal, almighty Creator. He has been called by
many names, including: "Zeus," "Jupiter," "Brahma," "Allah," "Ra," "Odin," "Ashur,"
"Izanagi," "Viracocha," "Ahura Mazda," and "the Great Spirit" to name just a few. He's seen by
some as "Mother Nature" and by others as "Father God."

When we ask someone else, they always end up describing the character attributes of someone or
what they have accomplished. “He’s tall, dark, handsome, kind, gentle, strong, and so
on.” But who are we really and if we don’t know that answer, how would we know the answer to
“Who is God”?

For people who don’t believe in a Divine Presence, God is just a three-letter word, a word
that is spoken in fits of rage or casual conversation. In their search for meaning in their
lives, they look to what they can visualize, touch, and feel. The word "god" is given to the
satisfaction of their desires. But for a Christian, God is the ever-living Presence who
desires so much to be a part of our freedom in Him that He became Life to us.

Names of God, or  Holy Names , describes a form of addressing  God  present in  liturgy
or  prayer  of various world religions.Prayer involving the Holy Name or the Name of God has
become established as common spiritual practice in both Western and Eastern spiritual
practices. A number of traditions have lists of many names of God, many of which enumerate the
various qualities of the Supreme Being. According to Islam, the earliest mention of the name
of God is found in the Koran sura 2, The Cow: "When your Lord said to the angels: 'I am placing on
the earth one that shall rule as My deputy,' they replied: 'Will You put there one that will do
evil and shed blood, when we have for so long sung Your praises and sanctified Your Name?"
Mohammad encouraged his followers to call upon God by any of His 99 Names. Judaism  refers to
72  Divine Names , and the  Hindu  scripture  Mahabharata  contains a thousand names
of  Vishnu .

The English word "God" is used by multiple religions as a  noun  or  name  to refer to
different deities.

WHO IS GOD ANYWAY?

Most people wonder about this same question at some time or other. If there is a God, how can we
know that he exists and how can we find him? In some ways God is like an atom. You can't see him with
the naked eye but you can see evidence of his presence and power everywhere you look.

Research scientist Lambert Dolphin Jr. writes, "Confronted every day with the mysteries of
space and the atom, I continue to be amazed at the complexity and order of our universe. From the
sub-microscopic realm of the atom to the expanding reaches of the galaxies, our universe runs
like intricate and well-oiled clockwork according to great physical laws which never change
or falter”.

Our sun, which is the nearest star, a hundred earth diameters across, is 93 million miles into
space. Each day the sun supplies our solar system with heat, power and light at the rate of a
million billion, billion horsepower! Yet it is only an average star.

Our island universe of stars which we call the Milky Way is 100,000 light years across. If we
could travel at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second), it would take us 100,000 years to
traverse the Milky Way! Yet this is only one of a billion or more such island universes
stretched out in every direction from our earth to distances measured in billions of light
years.

Nonetheless, one doesn't need to be a scientist to see and feel the greatness of creation all
around us.
