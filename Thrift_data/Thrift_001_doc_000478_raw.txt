LIFESTYLES OF THE DC REGIONS´ RICH AND FAMOUS (Part 1)

I was curious as to how the other half (actually 1/2 of 1/2 of 1/2 of 1%) lives, so I decided to
do some research on the Estates of the Rich & "Famous" in the Washington DC area.

 

Here´s what I found...

About the seller...



All three lots are owned by Harry L. Belin, whose grandfather, international diplomat F.
Lammot Belin, bought Evermay in 1923.

Lammot Belin and his wife, Frances, created Evermay's much-admired gardens in 1931. They
also restored the 22-room house designed in the early 1790s by Nicholas King, surveyor of the
City of Washington. King planned Evermay with its first owner, Samuel Davidson, a Scotsman
who financed the construction in part by selling off other Washington land he owned,
including the sites of the White House, Treasury Department and Lafayette Park.

Wayne L. Berman

Managing Director, Ogilvy Government Relations

After more than 25 years in the nation´s capital, Wayne Berman holds an almost unmatched
position at the crossroads of policy, politics and campaign finance.



Berman´s government service helped establish him as one of Washington´s quietly
influential insiders on both domestic and foreign policy. President George Bush appointed
Berman Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Policy in January 1989, a post from which he was the
principal adviser to the Secretary of Commerce, served as the official US liaison to foreign
business groups and oversaw more than 60 projects that resulted in new export orders for US
goods.

Berman spent his time out of government building his own business and managing others. He is
the founder of Berman Enterprises, a lobbying and business consulting firm, which merged
with Ogilvy Government Relations in January 2004. He is the Vice Chairman of JLT America, a
London based international insurance brokerage. In the early 1990s, he served as a managing
partner of America Mercantile Group, a private merchant bank. And he was the managing partner
of a Washington consulting firm from 1985 to 1988.

Berman has played a substantive political role in just about every Republican presidential
campaign of the last generation. He was a senior advisor to the Bush/Cheney transition in
2001, the vice presidential campaign director for Dole/Kemp and deputy director of the
Republican National Convention in 1996, director of congressional relations during the
Bush/Quayle campaign in 1988 and a deputy director of the Bush/Reagan transition team in
1981. He has served in a variety of fundraising capacities in every Republican presidential
race since 1992.

Berman has served on the board of trustees for the Library of Congress, the Center for
Strategic and International Studies as well as the Center for the Study of the Presidency and
helped lead campaigns for So Others May Eat, (SOME). He has appeared on CNN and CNBC.

A native of Rochester, NY, Berman received his BA from the University of Buffalo and attended
graduate school at Georgetown.

About the seller...



Halcyon House is a Georgian style home in Washington, DC . Located in the heart of Georgetown,
the house was built by the first Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin Stoddert . The original
structure was nearly obliterated in the mid 20th Century by the eccentric demolitions and
remodeling efforts of prior owner Albert Clemens, who much like Sarah Winchester believed
perpetually rebuilding the house would extend his life; possibly indefinitely. Today the
historic home has been extensively reconstructed at great cost to restore it to its original
appearance, and the house and grounds are listed on the National Register of Historic Places
[1] and serve primarily as a venue for special events.

About the seller...

Vintage Security was founded in 2001 by Johannes Willenpart and Rick Brokaw. The two
principals each have a 20+ year history in the security industry together. They previously
owned and operated Austronic Security Systems. Austronic Security was founded in 1981 by
Johannes Willenpart and grew to 140 employees serving 15,000 customers by 1996. Willenpart
successfully sold Austronic Security in 1996 to Republic Industries.

After the sale, the company was bought and sold five times by large national security
companies. Austronic's ex-employees experienced that large national companies were not
necessarily better companies. So in the summer of 2000, Willenpart had a reunion for his
former Austronic employees and was convinced into opening Vintage Security LLC.

Vintage Security opened in August 2001 with 35 employees (31 of whom were original Austronic
team members). The company has experienced unprecedented growth since its inception and now
employs around 75 team members. Vintage Security currently protects thousands of customers
across the Maryland, Virginia, and DC areas.
