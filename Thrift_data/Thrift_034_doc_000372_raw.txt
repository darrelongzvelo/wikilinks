Reservoir Dogs



Image: http://auggiesdiner.img.jugem.jp/20100523_761517.jpg

Reservoir Dogs  is a 1992  crime film  and the  debut  of director and writer  Quentin
Tarantino . It depicts the events before and after a botched diamond  heist , though not the
heist itself.  Reservoir Dogs  stars an  ensemble cast  with  Harvey Keitel ,  Steve
Buscemi ,  Tim Roth ,  Michael Madsen ,  Chris Penn , and  Lawrence Tierney . Tarantino has
a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author  Eddie Bunker . It incorporates many themes
and aesthetics that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime,  pop culture
 references, memorable dialogue, profuse  profanity , and a nonlinear storyline.

    The film has become a classic of  independent film  and a  cult hit . [ 2 ]  It was named
    "Greatest Independent Film of all Time" by  Empire .  Reservoir Dogs  was generally
    well received and the cast was praised by many critics. Although it was never given much
    promotion upon release, the film was a modest success by grossing  $ 2,832,029, which
    made its budget back. However, it did become a major hit in the  United Kingdom ; grossing
    nearly Žá 6.5 million, and it achieved higher popularity after the success of
    Tarantino's  Pulp Fiction . It is often criticized for its high degree of violence and
    profanity, and audience members reportedly walked out during the film's now notorious
    torture scene. Tweet Check

Beastie Boys



Image: http://auggiesdiner.img.jugem.jp/20100523_761496.jpg

Beastie Boys  are an American  hip-hop  group from New York City. The group comprises 
Michael "Mike D" Diamond ,  Adam "MCA" Yauch , and  Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz . Since around
the time of the  Hello Nasty album, the DJ for the group has been  Michael "Mix Master Mike"
Schwartz , who was first featured in the song " Three MCs and One DJ ". [ 1 ]

    Beastie Boys began as a  hardcore punk  group in 1979, appeared on the compilation
    cassette  New York Thrash  with Riot Fight and Beastie, and released their debut EP in
    1982. After achieving moderate local success with the 1983 release of experimental
    hip-hop 12"  Cooky Puss , they switched to hip-hop in 1984 and a string of successful 12"
    singles followed culminating with their debut album  Licensed to Ill  (1986) which
    enjoyed international critical acclaim and commercial success. The group is
    well-known for its eclecticism; jocular and flippant attitude toward interviews and
    interviewers; obscure cultural references and kitschy lyrics; and for performing in
    outlandish matching suits. Tweet Check

    The Specials  (sometimes called  The Special AKA ) are an  English   2 Tone   ska
     revival  band  formed in 1977 in  Coventry ,  England . [ 1 ]  Their music combined
    a "danceable ska and rocksteady beat with punk's energy and attitude", and had a "more
    focused and informed political and social stance" than other ska groups. The group was
    formed by songwriter/keyboardist Jerry Dammers, with Terry Hall (vocals), Lynval
    Golding (guitar, vocals) and a rhythm section. The band wore  mod -style "1960s
    period  rude boy  outfits ( pork pie hats , tonic and mohair suits, and loafers)." [ 2 ]
     In 1979, the song "Too Much Too Young", the lead track on their  The Special AKA Live!  
    EP , reached number one in the UK. [ 3 ]  In 1981, the unemployment-themed single "Ghost
    Town" single also hit number one in the  UK Singles Chart . [ 1 ] Tweet Check

    Woodrow Wilson "Woody" Guthrie  (July 14, 1912 – October 3, 1967) is best known as an
    American  singer-songwriter  and  folk musician , whose musical legacy includes
    hundreds of political,  traditional  and children's songs,  ballads  and
    improvised works. He frequently performed with the slogan  This Machine Kills
    Fascists  displayed on his guitar. His best-known song is " This Land Is Your Land ",
    which is regularly sung in American schools. Many of his recorded songs are archived in
    the  Library of Congress . [ 1 ]  He is considered by many to be the greatest political
    songwriter of the Twentieth Century. [ citation needed ] Guthrie traveled with migrant
    workers from Oklahoma to California and learned traditional folk and blues songs. Many
    of his songs are about his experiences in the  Dust Bowl  era during the  Great
    Depression , earning him the nickname the "Dust Bowl Troubadour". [ 2 ]  Throughout his
    life Guthrie was associated with United States  communist  groups, though he was
    never an actual member of any. [ 3 ] Tweet Check

Raoul Duke





Image: http://auggiesdiner.img.jugem.jp/20100521_756144.jpg





Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  is a  1998  film adaptation of  Hunter S. Thompson's
 1971 novel  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American
Dream . The film, directed by  Terry Gilliam , stars  Johnny Depp  as  Raoul Duke  and 
Benicio del Toro  as  Dr. Gonzo .

    Previous attempts to adapt the book into a film included  Jack Nicholson  and  Marlon
    Brando  as Duke and Gonzo. At one point,  Dan Aykroyd  and  John Belushi  were
    considered for the duo;  John Cusack  was also almost cast. Animator/filmmaker 
    Ralph Bakshi ,  Martin Scorsese , and  Oliver Stone  all tried unsuccessfully to
    direct an adaptation. Thompson met Depp and was convinced no one else could play him.
    Filmmaker  Alex Cox  was eventually hired to direct with Depp and Del Toro committed to
    starring in the film, but the filmmaker had "creative differences" with Thompson over
    the script treatment as documented in the documentary  Breakfast with Hunter . Gilliam
    was subsequently hired and made the film with the writer's approval. Tweet Check
