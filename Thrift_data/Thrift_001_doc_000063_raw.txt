Early years (1932â€“1942)



Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor was born in Hampstead , a wealthy district of North West London , the
second child of Francis Lenn Taylor [4] (1897â€“1968) and Sara Viola Warmbrodt
(1895â€“1994), who were Americans residing in England . Taylor’s older brother,
Howard Taylor, was born in 1929. [5]

Her parents were originally from Arkansas City, Kansas . Her father was an art dealer and her
mother a former actress whose stage name was “Sara Sothern”. Sothern retired from the
stage when she and Francis Taylor married in 1926 in New York City. Taylor’s two first names
are in honor of her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Mary (Rosemond) Taylor. A dual citizen of
the UK and the U.S., she was born a British subject through her birth on British soil and an
American citizen through her parents . [ citation needed ] She reportedly sought, in 1965, to
renounce her United States citizenship, to wit â€œThough never accepted by the State
Department, Liz renounced in 1965. Attempting to shield much of her European income from US
taxes, Liz wished to become solely a British citizen. According to news reports at the time,
officials denied her request when she failed to complete the renunciation oath, refusing to
say that she renounced â€œall allegiance to the United States of
America.â€�â€� [6]

At the age of three, Taylor began taking ballet lessons with Vaccani. Shortly before the
beginning of World War II, her parents decided to return to the United States to avoid
hostilities. Her mother took the children first, arriving in New York in April 1939, [7] while
her father remained in London to wrap up matters in the art business, arriving in November. [8]
They settled in Los Angeles, California, where Sara’s family, the Warmbrodts, were then
living.

Through Hedda Hopper , the Taylors were introduced to Andrea Berens , a wealthy English
socialite and also fiancÃ©e of Cheever Cowden , chairman and major stockholder of
Universal Pictures in Hollywood. Berens insisted that Sara bring Elizabeth to see Cowden
who, she was adamant, would be dazzled by Elizabeth’s breathtaking dark beauty; she was
born with a mutation that caused double rows of eyelashes, which enhanced her appearance on
camera. [9] Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soon took interest in the British youngster as well but she
failed to secure a contract with them after an informal audition with producer John Considine
had shown that she couldn’t sing. However, on September 18, 1941, Universal Pictures
signed Elizabeth to a six-month renewable contract at $100 a week.

Taylor appeared in her first motion picture at the age of nine in There’s One Born Every
Minute , her only film for Universal Pictures. Less than six months after she signed with
Universal, her contract was reviewed by Edward Muhl , the studio’s production chief. Muhl
met with Taylor’s agent, Myron Selznick (brother of David), and Cheever Cowden. Muhl
challenged Selznick’s and Cowden’s constant support of Taylor: “She can’t sing,
she can’t dance, she can’t perform. What’s more, her mother has to be one of the most
unbearable women it has been my displeasure to meet.” [10] Universal cancelled Taylor’s
contract just short of her tenth birthday in February 1942. Nevertheless on October 15, 1942,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed Taylor to $100 a week for up to three months to appear as
“Priscilla” in the film Lassie Come Home .

Adolescent star



Lassie Come Home featured child star Roddy McDowall , with whom Taylor would share a lifelong
friendship. Upon its release in 1943, the film received favourable attention for both
McDowall and Taylor. On the basis for her performance in Lassie Come Home MGM signed Taylor to a
conventional seven-year contract at $100 a week but increasing at regular intervals until it
reached a hefty $750 during the seventh year. Her first assignment under her new contract at
MGM was a loan-out to 20th Century Fox for the character of Helen Burns in a film version of the
Charlotte Bronte novel Jane Eyre (1944). During this period she also returned to England to
appear in another Roddy McDowall picture for MGM, The White Cliffs of Dover (1944). But it was
Taylor’s persistence in campaigning for the role of Velvet Brown in MGM’s National
Velvet that skyrocketed Taylor to stardom at the tender age of 12. Taylor’s character,
Velvet Brown, is a young girl who trains her beloved horse to win the Grand National. National
Velvet , which also costarred beloved American favorite Mickey Rooney and English newcomer
Angela Lansbury , became an overwhelming success upon its release in December 1944 and
altered Taylor’s life forever. Also, many of her back problems have been traced to when she
hurt her back falling off a horse during the filming of National Velvet .

National Velvet grossed over US$4Â million at the box office and Taylor was signed to a new
long-term contract that raised her salary to $30,000 per year. To capitalize on the box office
success of Velvet, Taylor was shoved into another animal opus, Courage of Lassie , in which a
different dog named “Bill”, cast as an Allied combatant in World War II, regularly
outsmarts the Nazis, with Taylor going through another outdoors role. The 1946 success of
Courage of Lassie led to another contract drawn up for Taylor earning her $750 per week, her
mother $250, as well as a $1,500 bonus. Her roles as Mary Skinner in a loan-out to Warner
Brothers’ Life With Father (1947), Cynthia Bishop in Cynthia (1947), Carol Pringle in A
Date with Judy (1948) and Susan Prackett in Julia Misbehaves (1948) all proved to be
successful. Her reputation as a bankable adolescent star and nickname of “One-Shot Liz”
(referring to her ability to shoot a scene in one take) promised her a full and bright career
with Metro. Taylor’s portrayal as Amy, in the American classic Little Women (1949) would
prove to be her last adolescent role. In October 1948, she sailed aboard the RMS Queen Mary
travelling to England where she would begin filming on Conspirator , in which she would play
her first adult role.

Transition into adult roles

In Father of the Bride

When released in 1949, Conspirator bombed at the box office, but Taylor’s portrayal of
21-year-old debutante Melinda Grayton (keeping in mind that Taylor was only 16 at the time of
filming) who unknowingly marries a communist spy (played by 38-year-old Robert Taylor ), was
praised by critics for her first adult lead in a film, even though the public didn’t seem
ready to accept her in adult roles. Taylor’s first picture under her new salary of $2,000 per
week was The Big Hangover (1950), both a critical and box office failure, that paired her with
screen idol Van Johnson . The picture also failed to present Taylor with an opportunity to
exhibit her newly realized sensuality. Her first box office success in an adult role came as
Kay Banks in the romantic comedy Father of the Bride (1950), alongside Spencer Tracy and Joan
Bennett . The film spawned a sequel, Father’s Little Dividend (1951), which Taylor’s
costar Spencer Tracy summarised with “boringâ€Š boringâ€Š boring”. The film
was received well at the box office but it would be Taylor’s next picture that would set the
course for her career as a dramatic actress. In late 1949, Taylor had begun filming George
Stevens ‘ A Place In The Sun . Upon its release in 1951, Taylor was hailed for her performance
as Angela Vickers, a spoiled socialite who comes between George Eastman ( Montgomery Clift )
and his poor, pregnant factory-working girlfriend Alice Tripp ( Shelley Winters ). [

The film became the pivotal performance of Taylor’s career as critics acclaimed it as a
classic, a reputation it sustained throughout the next 50 years of cinema history. The New
York Times’ A.H. Weiler wrote, “Elizabeth’s delineation of the rich and beauteous
Angela is the top effort of her career”, and the Boxoffice reviewer unequivocally stated
“Miss Taylor deserves an Academy Award “. She later reflected: “If you were considered
pretty, you might as well have been a waitress trying to act â€“ you were treated with no
respect at all.” [ citation needed ]

Taylor became increasingly unsatisfied with the roles being offered to her at the time. While
she wanted to play the lead roles in The Barefoot Contessa and I’ll Cry Tomorrow , MGM
continued to restrict her to mindless and somewhat forgettable films such as: a cameo as
herself in Callaway Went Thataway (1951), Love Is Better Than Ever (1952), Ivanhoe (1952),
The Girl Who Had Everything (1953) and Beau Brummel (1954). She had wanted to play the role of
Lady Rowena in Ivanhoe , but the part was given to Joan Fontaine . Taylor was given the role of
Rebecca. When Taylor became pregnant with her first child, MGM forced her through The Girl Who
Had Everything (even adding two hours to her daily work schedule) so as to get one more film out
of her before she became too heavily pregnant. Taylor lamented that she needed the money, as
she had just bought a new house with second husband Michael Wilding and with a child on the way
things would be pretty tight. Taylor had been forced by her pregnancy to turn down Elephant
Walk (1954), though the role had been designed for her. Vivien Leigh , almost two decades
Taylor’s senior, but to whom Taylor bore a striking resemblance, got the part and went to
Ceylon to shoot on location. Leigh suffered a nervous breakdown during filming, and Taylor
reclaimed the role after the birth of her child Michael Wilding, Jr. in January 1953. [

Taylor’s next screen endeavor, Rhapsody (1954), another tedious romantic drama, proved
equally frustrating. Taylor portrayed Louise Durant, a beautiful rich girl in love with a
temperamental violinist ( Vittorio Gassman ) and an earnest young pianist ( John Ericson ). A
film critic for the New York Herald Tribune wrote: “There is beauty in the picture all right,
with Miss Taylor glowing into the camera from every angleâ€Š but the dramatic pretenses
are weak, despite the lofty sentences and handsome manikin poses.” [ citation needed ]

Taylor’s fourth period picture, Beau Brummell , made just after Elephant Walk and Rhapsody
, cast her as the elaborately costumed Lady Patricia, which many felt was only a screen
propâ€”a ravishing beauty whose sole purpose was to lend romantic support to the
film’s title star, Stewart Granger . The Last Time I Saw Paris (1954) fared only slightly
better than her previous pictures, with Taylor being reunited with The Big Hangover costar
Van Johnson. The role of Helen Ellsworth Willis was based on that of Zelda Fitzgerald and,
although pregnant with her second child, Taylor went ahead with the film, her fourth in twelve
months. Although proving somewhat successful at the box office, she still yearned for
meatier roles. [ citation needed ]

1955â€“1979

In Cleopatra (1963)

Following a more substantial role opposite Rock Hudson and James Dean in George Stevens ‘
epic Giant (1956), Taylor was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for the
following films: Raintree County (1957) [11] opposite Montgomery Clift ; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof
(1958) [12] opposite Paul Newman ; and Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) [13] with Montgomery
Clift, Katharine Hepburn and Mercedes McCambridge .

In 1960, Taylor became the highest paid actress up to that time when she signed a one million
dollar contract to play the title role in 20th Century Fox ‘s lavish production of Cleopatra
, [13] which would eventually be released in 1963. During the filming, she began a romance with
her future husband Richard Burton, who played Mark Antony in the film. The romance received
much attention from the tabloid press, as both were married to other spouses at the time. [14]

Taylor won her first Academy Award , for Best Actress in a Leading Role , for her performance as
Gloria Wandrous in BUtterfield 8 (1960), [15] which co-starred then husband Eddie Fisher .

Her second Academy Award, also for Best Actress in a Leading Role, was for her performance as
Martha in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), [16] playing opposite then husband
Richard Burton. Taylor and Burton would appear together in six other films during the decade
â€“ The V.I.P.s (1963), The Sandpiper (1965), The Taming of the Shrew (1967), Doctor
Faustus (1967), The Comedians {1967} and Boom! (1968).

Taylor appeared in John Huston ‘s Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967) opposite Marlon Brando
(replacing Montgomery Clift [17] who died before production began) and Secret Ceremony
(1968) opposite Mia Farrow . However, by the end of the decade her box-office drawing power had
considerably diminished, as evidenced by the failure of The Only Game in Town (1970), with
Warren Beatty . [18]

Taylor continued to star in numerous theatrical films throughout the 1970s, such as Zee and
Co. (1972) with Michael Caine , Ash Wednesday (1973), The Blue Bird (1976) with Jane Fonda and
Ava Gardner , and A Little Night Music (1977). With then-husband Richard Burton, she
co-starred in the 1972 films Under Milk Wood and Hammersmith Is Out , and the 1973 made-for-TV
movie Divorce His, Divorce Hers . A chain smoker, in October 1975 she was diagnosed with lung
cancer , although it later proved to be a misdiagnosis.

1980â€“2003



Taylor starred in the 1980 mystery film The Mirror Crack’d , based on an Agatha Christie
novel. In 1985, she played movie gossip columnist Louella Parsons in the TV film Malice in
Wonderland opposite Jane Alexander , who played Hedda Hopper . Taylor appeared in the
miniseries North and South . Her last theatrical film was 1994′s The Flintstones . In 2001,
she played an agent in the TV film These Old Broads . She appeared on a number television series,
including the soap operas General Hospital and All My Children , as well as the animated series
The Simpsons â€”once as herself, and once as the voice of Maggie Simpson , uttering one
word “Daddy”.

Taylor also acted on the stage , making her Broadway and West End debuts in 1982 with a revival of
Lillian Hellman ‘s The Little Foxes . She was then in a production of Noel Coward’s Private
Lives (1983), in which she starred with her former husband, Richard Burton. The student-run
Burton Taylor Theatre in Oxford was named for the famous couple after Burton appeared as
Doctor Faustus in the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS) production of the Marlowe
play. Taylor played the ghostly, wordless Helen of Troy, who is entreated by Faustus to
“make [him] immortal with a kiss”. [ citation needed ]

In the 1980s, she received treatment for alcoholism . [19]

2003â€“2011



In November 2004, Taylor announced that she had been diagnosed with congestive heart
failure, a progressive condition in which the heart is too weak to pump sufficient blood
throughout the body, particularly to the lower extremities: the ankles and feet. She broke
her back five times, had both her hips replaced, survived a benign brain tumor operation and
skin cancer, and faced life-threatening bouts with pneumonia twice. Towards the end of her
life she was reclusive and sometimes failed to make scheduled appearances due to illness or
other personal reasons. She used a wheelchair and when asked about it stated that she had
osteoporosis and was born with scoliosis . [20]

In 2005, Taylor was a vocal supporter of her friend Michael Jackson in his trial in California
on charges of sexually abusing a child. [21] [22] He was acquitted.

On 30 May 2006, Taylor appeared on Larry King Live to refute the claims that she had been ill, and
denied the allegations that she was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and was close to
death. [23]

In late August 2006, Taylor decided to take a boating trip to help prove that she was not close to
death. She also decided to make Christie’s auction house the primary place for selling her
jewelry, art, clothing, furniture and memorabilia. [24] Six months later, the February 2007
issue of Interview magazine was devoted entirely to Taylor. It celebrated her life, career
and her upcoming 75th birthday.

On 5 December 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and California First Lady
Maria Shriver inducted Taylor into the California Hall of Fame , located at The California
Museum for History, Women and the Arts . [25]

Taylor was in the news in 2007 for a rumored ninth marriage to her companion Jason Winters,
which she dismissed as a rumour. [26] However, she was quoted as saying, “Jason Winters is
one of the most wonderful men I’ve ever known and that’s why I love him. He bought us the most
beautiful house in Hawaii and we visit it as often as possible,” [27] to gossip columnist Liz
Smith . Winters accompanied Taylor to Macy’s Passport HIV/AIDS 2007 gala, where Taylor was
honoured with a humanitarian award. In 2008, Taylor and Winters were spotted celebrating the
4th of July on a yacht in Santa Monica, California . [28] The couple attended the Macy’s
Passport HIV/AIDS gala again in 2008.

On December 1, 2007, Taylor acted on-stage again, appearing opposite James Earl Jones in a
benefit performance of the A. R. Gurney play Love Letters . The event’s goal was to raise $1
million for Taylor’s AIDS foundation. Tickets for the show were priced at $2,500, and more
than 500 people attended. The event happened to coincide with the 2007 Writers Guild of
America strike and, rather than cross the picket line, Taylor requested a “one night
dispensation.” The Writers Guild agreed not to picket the Paramount Pictures lot that
night to allow for the performance. [29]

Taylor on a show celebrating her life, late 1981

Taylor had a passion for jewelry. She was a client of well-known jewelry designer, Shlomo
Moussaieff . Over the years she owned a number of well-known pieces, two of the most
talked-about being the 33.19-carat (6.64Â g) Krupp Diamond and the 69.42-carat
(13.88Â g) pear-shaped Taylor-Burton Diamond , which were among many gifts from husband
Richard Burton. Taylor also owned the 50-carat (10Â g) La Peregrina Pearl, purchased by
Burton as a Valentine’s Day present in 1969. The pearl was formerly owned by Mary I of England
, and Burton sought a portrait of Queen Mary wearing the pearl. Upon the purchase of such a
painting, the Burtons discovered that the British National Portrait Gallery did not have an
original painting of Mary, so they donated the painting to the Gallery. [30] [31] Her enduring
collection of jewelry has been documented in her book My Love Affair with Jewelry (2002) with
photographs by the New York photographer John Bigelow Taylor (no relation).

Taylor started designing jewels for The Elizabeth Collection, creating fine jewelry with
elegance and flair. The Elizabeth Taylor collection by Piranesi is sold at Christie’s . She
also launched three perfumes, “Passion”, “White Diamonds”, and “Black
Pearls”, which, together, earn an estimated US$200Â million in annual sales. In fall
2006, Taylor celebrated the 15th anniversary of her White Diamonds perfume, one of the top 10
best selling fragrances for more than the past decade. [ citation needed ]

Taylor devoted much time and energy to AIDS -related charities and fundraising. She helped
start the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) after the death of her former costar
and friend, Rock Hudson . She also created her own AIDS foundation, the Elizabeth Taylor Aids
Foundation (ETAF). By 1999, she had helped to raise an estimated US$50Â million to fight
the disease. In 2006, Taylor commissioned a 37-foot (11Â m) “Care Van” equipped with
examination tables and X Ray equipment and also donated US$40,000 to the New Orleans Aids task
force , a charity designed for the New Orleans population with AIDS and HIV . The donation of the
van was made by the Elizabeth Taylor HIV/AIDS Foundation and Macy’s . [32]

In the early 1980s, Taylor moved to Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, which was her residence
until her death. She also owned homes in Palm Springs, London and Hawaii.

Taylor was a supporter of Kabbalah and member of the Kabbalah Centre . She encouraged
long-time friend Michael Jackson to wear a red string as protection from the evil-eye during
his 2005 trial for molestation, where he was eventually cleared of all charges. On 6 October
1991, Taylor had married construction worker Larry Fortensky at Jackson’s Neverland
Ranch . [33] In 1997, Jackson presented Taylor with the exclusively written-for-her epic
song “Elizabeth, I Love You”, performed on the day of her 65th birthday celebration.

In October 2007, Taylor won a legal battle, over a Van Gogh painting in her possession, View of
the Asylum and Chapel at Saint Remy . The United States Supreme Court refused to reconsider a
legal suit filed by four persons claiming that the artwork belonged to one of their Jewish
ancestors, [34] regardless of any statute of limitations .

Taylor attended Michael Jackson’s private funeral on 3 September 2009. [35]
