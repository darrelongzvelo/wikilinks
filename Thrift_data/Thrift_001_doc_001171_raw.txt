 Bill Goldberg Bio:

 

Professional wrestling career





World Championship Wrestling (1997-2001)





Debut & Early Gimmick (1996-1997)



Goldberg met several employees of the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) professional
wrestling promotion while living in Atlanta, Georgia , and decided to pursue a career in
wrestling after meeting WCW employees Sting and Lex Luger in a gym that the two co-owned. He was
quickly signed to a contract by WCW and sent to the WCW Power Plant , a professional wrestling
school owned by WCW and operated by former wrestlers such as Dwayne Bruce . [8] [1] [2] After
training in the Power Plant for several months, Goldberg debuted on June 24, 1997, defeating
Buddy Landell in a dark match under the ring name Bill Gold (he had originally considered
wrestling as " Mossad ").

He said in his book, I'm Next: The Strange Journey of America's Most Unlikely Superstar , the
first match he lost in WCW was at a house show to Chad Fortune .

He made his first appearance on WCW television on September 22 , 1997 edition of Nitro ,
defeating Hugh Morrus as Bill Goldberg ,using the ring music previously used by Pat Tanaka .
This match marked the first victory of Goldberg's "streak"—a series of 173 consecutive
victories that took place on WCW television, pay-per-views , and house shows . After a short
time, the famed undefeated streak lost all credibility with "smart" fans as the number of
claimed victories was repeatedly raised from the actual tally, with no rhyme or reason.
During one point in his WCW career to help get Goldberg over, they would play the fans' chants of
"Goldberg" through the speakers of the arena. Goldberg admitted this in one of his books, but
claimed to never have known at the time.

With his bald head, goatee , and utilitarian black trunks, Goldberg was often compared to
Stone Cold Steve Austin , a prominent wrestler in the rival World Wrestling Federation (WWF).
However, WCW President Eric Bischoff later claimed that the original gimmick of Goldberg was
based not on Austin but on Ken Shamrock , another WWF employee and famed mixed martial artist .
Goldberg also became known for his ring entrance during his "streak", which saw him walk from
his locker room to the stage with a police escort and exit the "tunnel" with pyrotechnics smoke
would engulf him. Goldberg would inhale and then exhale the smoke once the cloud dissipated.
exploding around him, while fans chanted "Goldberg, Goldberg." In later entrances, he would
stop at a point on the stage, and a shower of fireworks and a cloud of theatrical



Undefeated Streak (1997-1998)



Goldberg's succession of wins saw him quickly advance up the card, and pushed as a singles
wrestler. One of his first feuds was with Steve McMichael . Goldberg made his pay-per-view
debut at Starrcade 1997 , and defeated McMichael. In early 1998 , Goldberg defeated the likes
of Brad Armstrong at SuperBrawl VIII and Perry Saturn at Spring Stampede 1998 in squash
matches . On April 20 , 1998 edition of Nitro , he won the WCW United States Heavyweight
Championship , by defeating Raven . Two days later, on April 22 edition of Thunder , he made his
first successful title defense against Mike Enos .Goldberg started a feud with Raven and his
Flock . At Slamboree 1998 , he ended his feud with Flock after a successful title defense
against Saturn. He would continue to make successful title defenses of his title against
Konnan at The Great American Bash 1998 , and Curt Hennig .



Main Event Push (1998-1999)



Goldberg was getting over as a main eventer , after he defeated Hollywood Hogan on July 6
edition of Nitro to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship .As a result, he vacated the
United States title. He retained his title in his first title defense against Scott Hall in a
dark match. Goldberg began a feud with Curt Hennig, and retained the title against Hennig at
Bash at the Beach 1998 . He ended up retaining the title in a rematch against Hennig at the next
night on Nitro . At Road Wild 1998 , Goldberg won a battle royal , consisting of nWo members. ]
October 11 , 1998 , episode of WCW Monday Nitro , in Milwaukee, Wisconsin , Goldberg defeated
The Giant in a no-disqualification match, in an unbelievable feat of strength; Goldberg
executed a delayed vertical suplex before hitting the Jackhammer on The Giant [25] [26] [27] .
After Diamond Dallas Page became the #1 contender to the WCW title, Goldberg and Page began a
feud with each other. At Halloween Havoc 1998 , the feud was settled after Goldberg defeated
Page to retain the title. After settling out his feud with Page, he got involved in a short feud
with Bam Bam Bigelow , who had left ECW to wrestle Goldberg. On November 16 edition of Nitro ,
Goldberg defended the WCW title against Bigelow in Bigelow's WCW debut but the match went to a
no contest. On the

Both his reign and his streak ended at Starrcade 1998 when he lost his title to Kevin Nash after
Scott Hall made a run-in and shocked Goldberg with a cattle prod . [ However, Goldberg avenged
this act by facing Hall at Souled Out 1999 , in a Ladder Taser Match . Goldberg won when he used the
taser. The match could only be won by using the taser, which was hung high above the ring,
requiring the ladder to obtain it. [1] [2] [31] After the match, Goldberg's rival Bam Bam
Bigelow came out and attacked him, thus the duo began their rivalry once again. Goldberg
defeated Bigelow at SuperBrawl IX to settle the feud. At the same time, the WWF began mocking
Goldberg with the character Gillberg , a perennial jobber who dressed similarly to Goldberg
and mocked his signature entrance and mannerisms.

Goldberg took his revenge from Kevin Nash by defeating Nash at Spring Stampede 1999 .Goldberg
wrestled a match against Sting at Slamboree 1999 which was fought to a no contest.He was
"injured" and took some time off, for his movie Universal Soldier: The Return .He returned two
months later, and defeated Rick Steiner at Road Wild 1999 in a squash match . He started a feud
with Diamond Dallas Page and his Jersey Triad , which culminated in a match at Fall Brawl 1999
which Goldberg won. Around that same time, United States Champion Sid Vicious began a winning
streak by defeating two jobbers at the same time. After Goldberg settled his rivalry with DDP,
he began focusing on Vicious and challenged him to a match to end his winning streak. [2] The two
feuded with each other, which culminated in a match at Halloween Havoc 1999 for Sid's US title
and Goldberg defeated Sid, via referee stoppage, thus winning his second WCW United States
Heavyweight Championship. Later that night, he answered an open challenge from WCW World
Champion Sting and defeated him to win the championship.

However, on the next night's edition of Nitro , commissioner J.J. Dillon ruled that the match
had not been sanctioned by WCW and that, therefore, Goldberg's victory was void. The world
title was vacated and a 32-man tournament was held to determine a new champion, which started
that night. Goldberg participated in the tournament and defended his United States title
against Bret Hart in a first round tournament match and went on to lose the match, after
interference from Sid Vicious which gave Goldberg his second official loss in WCW in the
process. Goldberg continued his rivalry with Vicious, and defeated him in an "I Quit" match at
Mayhem 1999 .

Shortly thereafter, Goldberg joined forces with Hart, teaming with him to defeat Creative
Control for the WCW World Tag Team Championship The Outsiders (Scott Hall and Kevin Nash). At
Starrcade 1999 , Goldberg challenged Hart for the WCW World Championship. In the course of the
match, which was won by Hart, Goldberg delivered a stiff kick to Hart's head, legitimately
concussing him and tearing a muscle in his neck. This injury, combined with the various
injuries Hart had suffered in the course of his lengthy career and the additional blows to the
head he absorbed before being diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome , forced Hart into
retirement several weeks later. Despite that, Goldberg lost the match to Hart ,but with the
match shrouded in controversy Hart vacated the title the next night on Nitro , saying he didn't
want to win that way and granting Goldberg a rematch.Goldberg was defeated again due to
outside interference from Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, who began to beat on Goldberg with
baseball bats.In a swerve , Hart took one of the bats from The Outsiders and began beating on
Goldberg himself, doing enough damage to score the pin and regain his championship. After the
match, Hall, Nash, Hart, and Jeff Jarrett announced the reformation of the nWo, and gave
Goldberg a new target for a feud. However, it would not last long. on December 7. One week later,
they lost the titles to



Contender to the World Title (2000-2001)



Shortly after his title loss, Goldberg was accidentally injured in Salisbury, Maryland ,
during a sequence where he chased the nWo limousine into the parking lot. Goldberg, who was
wearing protective covering over his hands so he wouldn't get injured when he would break the
windshield glass (a spot in the scene), got a little too overaggressive in his pounding and
severely injured his forearm when shards of the glass sliced it, causing him to miss the
January 4 , 2000 NJPW Tokyo Dome show, where he was scheduled to face Manabu Nakanishi .

After taking time off to recuperate, Goldberg returned to WCW on May 29, 2000 interfering in a
Nitro match between Kevin Nash and the team of Tank Abbott and Rick Steiner . At The Great
American Bash 2000 , Goldberg betrayed Nash during Nash's World Title match against Jeff
Jarrett and turned heel for the first time in his career by aligning himself with the New Blood
faction. This didn't last long, as Goldberg would again be lost to injury and miss time. As a
result of this betrayal, Goldberg feuded with Nash and defeated him at Bash at the Beach 2000 ,
but with help from Scott Steiner . Goldberg thought that he deserved to be the #1 contender to
the world title, and faced World Champion Booker T for the title but lost the match. He
participated in a triple threat #1 contender's match against Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner at
New Blood Rising , which Nash won.Goldberg turned face again after Bret Hart attacked him on an
edition of Nitro and then he and Scott Steiner began a feud with each other, culminating in a no
disqualification match at Fall Brawl 2000 , which Goldberg lost.

He began a new undefeated streak in October 2000, with Vince Russo threatening to "fire" him if
he lost. He defeated KroniK ( Brian Adams Bryan Clark ) at Halloween Havoc 2000 in a handicap
elimination match to begin his undefeated streak. He started a feud with "The Total Package"
Lex Luger , who claimed to be the first wrestler to end both Goldberg's streak and career. This
culminated in a match at Mayhem 2000 , which Goldberg won. They continued their rivalry and
battled in a rematch at Starrcade 2000 , which if Goldberg lost, he had to retire . Goldberg won
the match, but after the match, he was attacked by Luger's partner Buff Bagwell . Goldberg
began feuding with both Luger and Bagwell, who called themselves Totally Buff . His streak was
broken at Sin when Goldberg, teaming with his Power Plant trainer, Dwayne Bruce , lost to
Totally Buff in a tag team no disqualification match after a plant maced him, enabling Totally
Buff to pin him. The angle was intended to enable Goldberg to have shoulder surgery, but WCW was
sold to the WWF in March 2001, with Goldberg still recuperating. The WWF did not buy out
Goldberg's contract with Time Warner (the parent company of WCW) as they had done with several
other WCW employees, and so he was not involved in the WWF " Invasion " angle. Goldberg instead
remained under contract to Time Warner until May 2002, when he agreed on a contract buyout. and

In the course of his WCW career, Goldberg had six official singles defeats: three to Bret Hart,
one to Kevin Nash, one to Scott Steiner , and one to Booker T.



All Japan Pro Wrestling (2002-2003)



Goldberg had suffered an arm injury during a celebrity car racing event in April 2002, but in
August 2002, he returned to the ring in Japan . He initially joined All Japan Pro Wrestling ,
defeating Satoshi Kojima on August 30 , 2002 and Taiyō Kea . He went on to defeat Rick Steiner in
Yokohama in a match for the W-1 promotion, and teamed with Keiji Mutoh to defeat KroniK in Tokyo
. His success in Japan led to the World Wrestling Federation - now renamed World Wrestling
Entertainment - beginning contract negotiations with him.



World Wrestling Entertainment (2003-2004)





Winning Streak on RAW (2003)



Goldberg was signed to a one year contract by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in March
2003. He debuted in WWE on March 31 , 2003 edition of RAW , the night after WrestleMania XIX , and
immediately began a feud with The Rock by spearing him. His feud with The Rock culminated in a
match at Backlash 2003 , which was Goldberg's first appearance in a WWE ring. The match was won
by Goldberg following three spears and a Jackhammer . He began a short feud with Christian ,
with whom he had his first RAW match on May 5 edition of RAW resulting in a no contest. The two
faced each other on the following edition of RAW in a steel cage match , which Goldberg won. He
next feuded with Chris Jericho , who continued to insult Goldberg in following weeks and
challenged him to a match. At Bad Blood 2003 , the rivalry was settled after Goldberg defeated
Jericho.



World Championship & Retirement (2003-2004)



Goldberg started a feud with World Heavyweight Champion Triple H over the World
Championship. Their rivalry began at a live event on July 20 , 2003 when Goldberg faced Triple H
for the title, but lost the match after Evolution interfered in the match. He challenged
Triple H for the title again at SummerSlam 2003 in the second Elimination Chamber match in WWE;
after eliminating Randy Orton , Shawn Michaels , and Jericho, he was pinned by the champion
Triple H and as a result, Triple H retained the title. Goldberg continued his rivalry with
Triple H and finally defeated him for the World Heavyweight Championship at Unforgiven 2003 ,
after agreeing to put his career on the line. He successfully defended the title against
Triple H in a rematch at Survivor Series 2003 , before he lost the title back to Triple H at
Armageddon 2003 when Triple H pinned him in a triple threat match which also included Kane .

At Royal Rumble 2004 , Goldberg participated in the Royal Rumble match , entering at #30, so he
could get a chance to regain his world title at WrestleMania . However, during the match, he
began a feud with WWE Champion Brock Lesnar who interfered in the match and hit Goldberg with
the F-5 and causing him to be eliminated by Kurt Angle . Goldberg gained revenge by attending No
Way Out 2004 the following month and costing Lesnar his WWE Championship by interfering in a
match between Lesnar and the challenger to the title, Eddie Guerrero .This led to a match
between the two being scheduled for WrestleMania XX . A match between the two had been highly
anticipated due to their similar physique and their undefeated streaks. Goldberg was not
seen on WWE television for several weeks before the event, as he had already worked the maximum
number of dates (bar one, his WrestleMania appearance) stipulated by his contract and would
have had to have been paid a supplementary salary in order to make extra appearances. This may
have hurt the build to the WrestleMania match, with the last episode of SmackDown! before
WrestleMania featuring a confrontation between Lesnar and Steve Austin , the guest referee
of the match, instead of Goldberg.

The Goldberg vs. Lesnar match is notable for a large majority of the crowd becoming aware that
this was to be both men's last match in WWE; it became known shortly before the match that Lesnar
was pursuing an NFL career. As a result, the audience 'turned' on them by booing and shouting
derogatory chants at both participants; although, Lesnar was more a target of the fans'
disdain (Austin was the only one to receive any cheers during that match). Both men showed
frustration in their performance, and amid the resounding boos, ringside commentator Jim
Ross acknowledged their plans to leave the company. Goldberg won the match cleanly but was
attacked by Austin post-match. Then a week later, his WWE contract expired and not renewed
thus ending Goldberg's WWE career.



Post-wrestling activity



Since leaving WWE, Goldberg has primarily focused on his acting career. He has commented on
his year with WWE in a highly critical fashion, arguing that his character was poorly
utilized.

In February 2006, several media outlets reported that Goldberg was in negotiations with the
professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ; possibly in response to
these rumors, semi-retired wrestler Warrior commented on his website that he would be
interested in wrestling Goldberg in TNA should TNA approach him with such an offer. In a series
of interviews conducted in June 2006, Goldberg stated that he was mildly interested in
working for TNA, particularly since his friend Sting had joined the promotion by then, but had
several reservations; he was holding out for a contract similar to the magnitude of Sting's.
Goldberg's name has been brought up frequently in TNA during angles and during backstage
discussions and rumors. Goldberg's name was first mentioned back at Lockdown 2006 , as
Goldberg became the target of a rumor of him joining Sting's warriors to wage war against
Jarrett's army as a result of Steiner being brought in. His name was also brought up as a
candidate for the consultant of Christian Cage, along with Brock Lesnar's, but it was later
revealed to be Scott Steiner. Goldberg was upset about this, as was Brock Lesnar, as neither of
them were informed that their names being on the list (since it was Brock Lesnar himself who
informed Goldberg of the list). Another rumor had surfaced about Goldberg being the fifth
member of Team Angle for the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown 2007 , but it was revealed that
Jeff Jarrett was that man.

He was scheduled to appear at WrestleFanFest Malice in the Palace on 19 October 2007 but did not
attend. [ citation needed ]
