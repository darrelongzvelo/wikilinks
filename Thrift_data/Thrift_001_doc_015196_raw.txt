Asylum of the Daleks

Posted by spdk1 — September 10, 2012

2



If there is one thing that the Daleks have been for the past 50 years, itâ€™s
inconsistent. Sometimes Daleks are intelligent, other times they are simply idiotic.
Sometimes they are evil, other times they are comical. And the most important: sometimes they
are scary, other times they are lame.

Despite my fondness for them firmly placing them above any other Doctor Who villain, it really
depends on who the writer is on how these guys are used. Episodes like 2005â€™s Dalek are
instant classics in the minds of many fans, while others such as Daleks In Manhattan come off as
camp as a sequined cape. I was surprised to realize that this was showrunner Steven Moffat
â€™s first real foray into these armored squid guys, and for the most part he really
nailed it. If anything, he has found that a way to make a monster scary again is to wound it, or
drive it crazy. The headless Cyberman armor in The Pandorica Opens is a fine example of this,
and in this episode we have an asylum full of the Dalek equivalents.

First thing first, I had no idea that Jenna Louise Coleman was going to be in this episode. For
the first time in a VERY long time we had an actual surprise that wasnâ€™t ruined by a big UK
newspaper or a questionable write-up in a magazine. Her appearance is a two edged sword
though, as I really enjoyed her character, but this is probably not the same character that
later shows up later on. Without outright spoiling my reasons for those that have not seen the
episode, letâ€™s just say that if it is her – Moffat will have to unleash the
â€œtimey wimeyâ€� on the show to achieve this.



Image:

This episode had it all for fans of older Dalek episodes. Returning, is a human slave class lead
by the Daleks, minus the stupid speech pattern that the robomen had, or those dumb helmets from
the Davison era. We had a glimmer of the many factions within the Dalek Empire including a new
â€œparliament of the Daleksâ€�. While this was a bit Star Wars-esque (galactic
senate anyone?) it achieved a reasonable way to have thousands of Daleks in a room at once.
Those thousands of Daleks were very impressive, but failed on one regard. The promise of
â€œEvery Dalek Ever Madeâ€� wasnâ€™t an outright lie, but one had to play
â€œ Whereâ€™s Waldo â€� to see most of them. There was a special weapons model,
and a 1960â€™s model in there from what I could see, but they werenâ€™t features
quite as prominently as I had hoped. I bet somebody with far too much free time has spotted them
all, but Iâ€™m too lazy for that.

All in all, I really liked this episode; it had everything I like about Moffat scripts:
mystery, surprises, horror, and a dash of humor. This season, despite how short it this half
is, seems to be more up my alley than the previous Christmas episode , and holds the
â€œblockbusterâ€� status teased in the lead-up. GA_googleAddAttr("LangId",

Survivors (2008) Episode 4

Posted by spdk1 — May 16, 2012

0



As is the norm with this show for a while, we have the episode split into a few separate story
strands to keep everything rolling nicely and to give each character something to do. There
are actually three main segments to follow: one with Abby, one with just about everyone else,
and one with Greg and Anya. Mysteriously, we donâ€™t really hear from the scientists
that have been popping up in the last few episodes. Youâ€™d think that their search for
the cure to the virus would get some mention here.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/survivors-bbc-series-1-episode-4-mansion-kids.jpg?w=441&h=247

Abby found out about a group of kids occupying a large mansion from the eco-commune last
episode, and has gone out to find out if her son is there. These kids have gone into full-on Lord
of the Flies mode without any parental supervision, and are causing havoc around the grounds
of the mansion, much to the dismay of the original owner of the mansion, a man that is hiding in
the woods while his belongings get ransacked. Sheâ€™s caught between these kids that
â€œcouldnâ€™t make it outsideâ€� and said owner. She realizes that she could
maybe get them to form an alliance of some sort, an option that seems easier said than done.

The second segment involves a familiar setting from last week. Here I thought the previous
episode was the last time weâ€™d see Samantha Willis and her creepy eco-commune, a place
that gets worse by the second. How wrong I was, as we only had to wait one mere episode! The
previous episode saw the former Health Minister becoming more and more of a ruthless despot as
she clings to power. Abby was completely unnerved by the way the members of this commune
handled â€œlawâ€� in their new community, and opted to leave despite all the good
things such a community could offer.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/survivors-2008-samantha-copy.jpg?w=440&h=276

The problem is that Willis is definitely making the hard choices that any leader should make,
and as the sole authority from the government left, sheâ€™s bound to start making a few
bad choices sooner than later. We saw her do things like punishing would-be supply thieves by
public execution to send a message, thus continuing her fall. In episode 4 we have the arrival
of Tom, Sarah, Najid, and Al in this community â€“ possibly to stay for the long haul. It
seems that despite the bad stuff going on, Abby let everyone else know about the place, and
wants to move on to find her son. As one would imagine this lasts about three seconds before bad
stuff goes down.

The weakest story in this episode has to be one involving Greg and Anya at the house. This
segment seems to be a situation of trying to find something for these left-out characters to
do, and serves little purpose otherwise. Basically, the pair find themselves under siege by a
pair of rapists, and spend a few moments fighting them off. Unlike the chicken coop
minor-segment in episode three, this piece was not very good.

Iâ€™d say this episode was a step down from the last one, but that isnâ€™t a bad
thing. This show usually stays pretty interesting, and the weaker episodes are still better
than most other shows in the same vein. I am worried that the show will keep having segments for
characters left out of the main plot such as tonightâ€™s foray into rape-busting, as
these sort of scenarios have seemed sort of half-assed so far. Hopefully we get to see what our
bunker-bound lab coat guys are up to, I miss those guys

Survivors (2008) Episode 3

Posted by spdk1 — May 9, 2012

0



Itâ€™s been a while since I did a write-up for this Survivors ; I guess I had a lot going on
and got a bit sidetracked. Recently, I got hooked on a U.S. based reality show called The Colony
, in which people are made to live in a situation resembling a post-apocalyptic virus
outbreak; I immediately thought of Survivors. A lot has happened in the first few episodes of
Survivors , and now that the main cast is all together, itâ€™s time to break everyone up
into little groups to look into the inner-workings of their characters. In the last episode,
we had things like Al finally opening up – moments like this are really the best thing the show
can offer. We get two such occurrences in this episode: Â Abby in one case, and Greg and Tom in
another.



Image: http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/survivors.jpg?w=440&h=214

In the first half of the story, Greg and Tom come across a family that has somehow managed to stay
isolated during the viral outbreak . The father of this family goes to insane lengths to
protect his family, such as forcing his kids to stay inside at all times. If he sees any living
creature, whether it is an animal or human, it needs to be killed to preserve their unaffected
status. He bathes in harsh chemicals if he steps outside, and burns his clothes afterwards.
This is all done because he loves his kids, but this extreme nature does nothing but bite him,
when he attacks Greg and Tom. They are forced to hide in this manâ€™s barn for a bit after
their car is destroyed, and accidentally expose the daughter to the virus. This brings up a
very bad situation where the father must choose for the daughter to leave with two unknown
strangers, or to stay there and possibly kill the rest of the family.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/survivors-2008-episode-3-copy.jpg?w=440&h=332

After seeing some terrible new 2012 inspired American TV shows such as Doomsday Preppers , the
attitude of the father makes me a bit sad. His paranoia for the unknown nature of the virus makes
his entire family miserable, and resent him. In the aforementioned program, people hoard
food, make ridiculous precautions, make their kids run paramilitary drills and other stuff
that seems to be a great idea, but as Survivors illustrates, would just end up failing anyway.

The other half of the episode sees Abby coming across a haven for other survivors while she is
out looking for her son. This camp is run by Samantha Willis, possibly one of the few government
heads left alive after the virus hit. While the place initially looks like a utopia as it has
food, electricity, and multiple survivors of all ages, it has a dark secret. These people
donâ€™t like outsiders, and have a warlike relationship with a group of marauders that
are trying to share the wealth. Problems like the viral epidemic seem to bring out the worst in
people, a running theme in this show, and a place like this colony go from being awesome to just
as bad as the gang that our characters met with in episode two.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/survivors-2008-samantha-copy.jpg?w=440&h=276

I liked this episode a lot because of the above situations the characters are forced into. The
story of the little girl is heartbreaking, and was the highlight of the show drama-wise for me.
Iâ€™ve seen other shows recently like Outcasts that try to be an interesting drama with a
bit of science fiction flavor, but end up being a glorified snuff film to make the audience feel
bad. These gruesome acts take the place of good writing, but fail to do anything for me.
Survivors doesnâ€™t rely on shock tactics and we see a bit of the other side of drama
â€“ warmth. The scenes were the remaining Survivors help build a chicken coop while
Abby, Tom, And Greg are out gives this slow a glimmer of hope, and thatâ€™s why I can always
come back to it.

Outcasts (2011) Episode 1

Posted by spdk1 — April 29, 2012

0



I was strolling through Netflixâ€™s new release list for streaming movies, and noticed
that the eight part BBC science fiction drama Outcasts had been added. I originally heard
about this particular show by way of commercials for BBC America â€™s weekend sci-fi
block, but never got around to watching it for some reason. To be honest another new show called
Bedlam sort of scared me away from the block for a while. This program is definitely closer to
â€œhard science fictionâ€� than the material I usually look at on here, in that it
has very little â€œfantasyâ€� elements in it. The story centers around a colony on
Planet Carpathia, a planet five years travel time from Earth. The residents of Carpathia,
mostly located in a settlement called Forthaven, escaped Earth to run away from a pending
nuclear holocaust.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/outcasts_2011_screenshot_1.jpg?w=440&h=330

While Iâ€™m not familiar with a lot of the cast of this show, I did recognize a few people.
Within the first few minutes we meet Cass Cromwell , as played by Daniel Mays . Mays also played
Jim Keats in Ashes to Ashes and Alex in A Doctor Who episode called â€œNight
Terrorsâ€� . I also recognized Liam Cunningham who plays President Richard Tate from
tons of movies and TV shows, I think most recently from Harry Brown .Â  Cunningham is also in
Games of Thrones , but I havenâ€™t seen any of that show to vouch for how substantial his
role is.

My first impression of Outcasts is that it is cut from the same cloth as far more popular shows
like Battlestar Galactica (2004), Stargate Universe (2009), and even Earth 2 (1994) in that
it relies far much more on drama than the actual science fiction elements involved. One
episode in, and this show could have honestly been set on Earth with very little difference in
the plot. I wouldnâ€™t go as far as saying that itâ€™s a bit drab (in both setting and
plot), but itâ€™s pretty close to how I feel.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/outcasts_2011_screenshot_2.jpg?w=440&h=292

My first problem is that the planet is a bit uninspired; itâ€™s basically just a
desert-like mountainous region somewhere (I think they filmed in South Africa). Nothing
really jumps out and says *ALIEN PLANET!* Even guys behind shows with terrible budgets such as
Hyperdrive had the sense to make the sky red or something. I know I have dealt with things like
the endless Canadian deciduous forest planets in Stargate SG1 , or the many rock quarry
planets in the old Doctor Who , but at least they had creepy aliens in them to suspend disbelief.
The production on this show basically stuck some plasma screen TVâ€™s in a few rooms of a
desert colony, and BOOM â€“finished.

If episode one is any indication, this show is going to be depressing. It pulls no punches at all
with people going crazy, people getting killed, and a multitude of other bleak situations. I
wasnâ€™t a fan of the recent Battlestar Galactica for this very reason, and really hope
that this isnâ€™t the norm from here on out. While the show has promise, I feel that this
introductory episode tried way too hard to be as dramatic as it could be, as if it saw all the
dramatic elements from other shows and decided to use them all at once. This episode
introduced too many characters at once, did a poor job of fleshing out the world, and sandbags
the viewer with enough bad stuff to make one of those sad Sarah McLaughlin commercials look
tame. Iâ€™m going to hang in there, and watch more, but Outcasts really needs to kick it up
a notch.

Reaction: Doctor Who â€“ The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe

Posted by spdk1 — January 3, 2012

Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/holly-earl-claire-skinner-matt-smith-and-maurice-cole-in-doctor-who-the-doctor-the-widow-and-the-wardrobe-christmas-special-600x425.jpg?w=440&h=311

Before I get into my review of The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe , Iâ€™d like to talk
about something that has bothered me for a while. After numerous Christmas Specials from
Doctor Who , I think they should be less â€œChristmasyâ€� for the most part from now
on. The Christmas gimmicks worked very well at first, but seem too forced now. Iâ€™m not
saying that I dislike them at all; itâ€™s just hard to take them as seriously as some of the
other episodes. When weâ€™ve seen the likes of evil Santa robots, evil Christmas trees,
Christmas star shaped spaceships and a lot more. Where exactly do we go from there?

There are only two Christmas related plots Iâ€™d like to see 1) one episode where the
travel back to the historical first Christmas (but that would most likely anger many
Christians), or 2) Have the Doctor Save some children from Krampus, the evil alternate Saint
Nicholas that punishes bad kids. Maybe the Christmas specials should start being just
â€œepicâ€� long form episodes like The End of Time ; that was such an episode and we
didnâ€™t have to cringe our way through demonic nutcrackers from Pluto or any other
contrived plot devices.

As one can tell, The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe is vaguely based on the legendary
series of novels by C.S. Lewis: The Chronicles of Narnia , and more specifically The Lion The
Witch and The Wardrobe , perhaps the most loved volume in the entire series. When I heard that
the episode was going to be based on the Narnia mythos, I was worried. I didnâ€™t want to
have the Doctor travel to a planet inhabited by talking lions and have to explain that Narnia
was real or something. Thankfully there was no such fan-fiction fueled
â€œfanwankeryâ€� and what we ended up with was an episode using a plot device from
the series: kids that travel to a far off land in a box. This was much more like the previous
Christmas special, A Christmas Carol , in that it was similar to the source material, but
wasnâ€™t a true remake of it and tried to stand on its own despite the allusions.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/the-doctor-the-widow-and-the-wardrobe-spoiler-pics-1.jpg?w=440&h=247

My only problem with the way it was constructed was that it felt like it honestly lacked any real
â€œspiritâ€� from the books it was based on. We had kids traveling to a snowy planet
and all, but they werenâ€™t really the main characters. Madge, as played by Claire
Skinner, was the main character, her children were simply window dressing in the grand scheme
of things. This was a story of a strong woman overcoming adversity in the face of peril to save
her kids, not a tale of wonder and adventure in a new world.

I liked The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe , but felt that it played it too
â€œsafeâ€� for the most part. It was a fun little romp that makes for a nice palette
cleanser after all of the dark stuff that happened in the last few episodes of season 6. With
strong performances from Skinner, a funny little cameo from Bill Bailey and a strange alien
race to fight, it had all the trappings for what it was made to be: a fun Christmas bit of family
viewing. Should I be sad, however, that I would have rather seen something a bit less “by the
numbers”, something like the pre-credits sequence with the exploding ship?

Reaction – Doctor Who: The Wedding of River Song

Posted by spdk1 — October 2, 2011

Image: http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/drwhowedding1.jpg?w=440

Tick tock goes the clock

And what now shall we play?

Tick tock goes the clock

Now summerâ€™s gone away?

Tick tock goes the clock

And what then shall we see?

Tick tock until the day

That thou shalt marry me

Tick tock goes the clock

And all the years they fly

Tick tock and all too soon

You and I must die

Tick tock goes the clock

He cradled her and he rocked her

Tick tock goes the clock

Even for the Doctor..

Tick tock goes the clock

He cradled her and he rocked her

Tick tock goes the clock

Till River kills the Doctor..

Now thatâ€™s more like it! After a few episodes that honestly felt like filler episodes
in the grand scheme of things, we have a really well done Moffat episode. I know the fanbase will
be largely split with Moffat fans rejoicing to the hills and his detractors slamming it, as
this was a VERY Moffat episode. Structured in a similar vein to The Impossible Astronaut and
even The Pandorica Opens , we see more of the old â€œtimey wimeyâ€� going on. We know
how the Doctor escapes death, why River is in prison, and whether or not River is married to the
Doctor (sort ofâ€Šlol).

Not every question was answered, but we got through a good chunk of it. I guess we can chalk most
of my previous ramblings about who broke into Amyâ€™s house, and the destruction of the
Tardis to be the master plan of the Silence to kill the Doctor at any means necessary. This
largely points to these first two seasons being merely a stepping stone in a much larger
ongoing storyline. This is both good and bad, as I hoped we would finally know everything that
has happened at this point, but Iâ€™m glad all the answers werenâ€™t rushed in one
solitary episode. I was truly worried that we were going to have seen sixty minutes of random
flashbacks and such.

The Wedding of River Song was a very important episode, not as much for the actual content, but
as a casual reboot of the series. What many may not notice is that with the perceived
â€œdeathâ€� of the Doctor as seen by many, we have seen the end of the â€œsuper
Jesus, Earth saviorâ€� Doctor, and the birth of a hopefully more reclusive Doctor that
spends less time on Earth. What I hope we see is more â€œmonster of the weekâ€�
episodes where we might see a sense of the Silence â€œbeing onto himâ€� or some such,
but just in the background. We all know this will lead to the eventual reveal of the final battle
between the Doctor and the Silence, most likely for the 50 th Anniversary. I still cling to the
possibility that we havenâ€™t seen the person in charge of the Silence as of yet, and it
would be amazing to find out who it is in a few years. All I know is that once he starts going to a
place called â€œThe Fields of Trensaloreâ€� weâ€™re in for it.

Another fun tidbit is that the emphasis on the mystery behind the Doctorâ€™s name adds
new relevance to the title of the show. Many casual fans, or folks that may skim an episode here
and there may wonder why the show is even called Doctor Who , some might even think that
itâ€™s his name. Itâ€™s a nice capstone for nearly 50 years of continuity and makes
us wonder why heâ€™s so secretive of his name. Does his name link him to something
terrible?

My ongoing theory is that there is some big bad guy out there that needs to know the
Doctorâ€™s name for some reason. Iâ€™m wondering if the Doctor didnâ€™t use
it as the password for the â€œtime lockâ€� he used to trap the Time Lords and Daleks
within Gallifrey, once it is uttered, this lock will be broken and cause havoc. Suddenly
youâ€™d have The Master set free, and all sorts of other pissed off Timelords. This would
fit in with the alien coalition trying to stop the Doctor at all costs with the Pandorica, and
even explain the Silence claiming that they have witnessed a dark future caused by the Doctor.
Of course we wonâ€™t hear the name as viewers, as finding out that the Doctorâ€™s
name is â€œBarryâ€� would probably ruin the show.

On a side note, I loved the little â€œfan-wankyâ€� bits in this episode. For
starters, when we find that all of time has been compressed to a solitary moment, we see
anomalies such as Charles Dickens talking about his upcoming BBC Christmas special. Once he
gets rolling you realize that he is talking about A Christmas Carol. Dickens was once again
played by the returning Simon Callow, a man that many will remember from An Unquiet Dead way
back in season 1. Other nice nods included the reappearance of Winston Churchill, who has
apparently started riding a mammoth to work. With a less â€œin your faceâ€� cameo,
we find that fan favorite companion â€œThe Brigadierâ€� has finally been laid to
rest within the show. This follows the real life death of Nicholas Courtney. I would have liked
a similar send-off to the one Elisabeth Sladen received, but the nod was nice to see.

So yeah, good episode, and a good savior for a somewhat mellow second half of a season. I
canâ€™t wait to see where this goes.

Reaction: Doctor Who â€“ Closing Time

Posted by spdk1 — September 24, 2011

1





Image: http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/closing-time.jpg?w=433&h=206

Aside from Vincent and the Doctor , The Lodger was easily one of my favorite Doctor Who episodes
of season five. Aside from being totally unorthodox in the way it was structured, it was almost
like a buddy comedy. I felt that it was one of the better episodes solely based on the face that it
showed The Doctor totally at odds with how to act in modern society; it truly brought out his
alien nature. Simple mistakes like paying rent with a huge bag of cash may seem like a good idea
to The Doctor, but would raise more than a few eyebrows. When it was officially announced that
Craig (played by James Corden of Gavin & Stacy fame) would be returning as a
â€œfill-inâ€� companion this year, I was pretty stoked. Not only would a character
I liked return, but it was revealed to be a Cybermen episode. And not a Russell T. Davies era
â€œstomping around saying catchphrases Cybermenâ€� episode, but a proper one,
complete with Cybermats!

While there are some emotionless metal guys running around, the majority of the episode is
centered on The Doctor and his one last attempt at saving the world. It seems that despite
knowing that he will die in mere hours, he stops by Craigâ€™s old haunt on some sort of a
â€œfarewell tourâ€�. There is an ulterior motive of course, in that he has found
some kind of power fluctuations in the area, so the Doctor uses this as an excuse to investigate
a bit. What we see is a man on his last legs presumably 200 years after he dropped off Amy and Rory
(in his time), trying to cope with his imminent death, and stop the death of one of his friends.
Knowing that he basically endangers all that come near him, the Doctor wants Craig to stay
away, but seems to only draw him in more.

This episode was very good for what it was: the fluffy episode towards the series finale that
keeps one optimistic before their soul is crushed by the bleak ending we all know we will have.
This has been seen in Boom Town , Love & Monsters , and finally The Lodger . I know that all of these
episodes are somewhat â€œlove it or hate itâ€� affairs, but I think that Closing
Time is one of the better ones. My personal favorite thing about the episode was the
Doctorâ€™s revelation that Craigâ€™s son calls himself
â€œStormageddonâ€� in baby language; I give it weeks before someone actually
names their kid that. In the grand scheme of things Closing Time does nothing for the larger
picture save a scene with River Song at the very end, but that wasnâ€™t what it was there to
do. It was the â€œpalette cleanserâ€� right before the main course, the episode
that will hopefully blow us away and finish up some stuff weâ€™ve been getting worked up
about for 2 full seasons.

spoiler for next week:

Fragmentary Thoughts on Questions Still Left to Unanswered In Doctor Who

Posted by spdk1 — September 24, 2011

1



Since the end of Doctor Who â€™s fifth season I have been milling around a bag full of
questions that were seemingly left unanswered. I assume that some of this will be touched on in
the final episode of season six, but if it doesnâ€™t can it all be explained away by saying
â€œthe silence did it?â€� Most of these appeared in the penultimate and final
episodes last season, The Pandorica Opens and The Big Bang . Most of these seem to point towards
somebody or something â€œmessing withâ€� Amy at various points in time, and all
stem from one big question:

Why was the TARDIS taken back to June 26, 2010? â€“

â€œSpace and time isn’t safe yet. The Tardis exploded for a reason. Something drew the
Tardis to this particular date and blew it up. Why, and why now?”

- The Doctor at the end of The Big Bang

It has been speculated upon that this is a dangling plot thread left unanswered. At this point I
wonder if weâ€™ll actually see the real reason for this unveiled this season, but one
thing does come to mind. Assuming that Amy and Rory â€œgot it onâ€� right after their
wedding date, could the significance be that this was River Songâ€™s conception date?
This brings two possible options:

Was somebody trying to stop her existence? Going back to the conception date thing, we can
assume that River does not fulfill her goals set aside by the silence, so maybe they are trying
to kill her before she even is bornâ€ŠMaybe she is the one that actually stops their evil
plans. Here are examples of how River was supposed to get over-written Terminator style, only
to have the Doctor goof it up:

Somebody tried to kill Amy by somehow turning Rory into an Auton â€“ this failed because
of the Doctor.

Somebody broke into Amyâ€™s house before her wedding day, but she wasnâ€™t
thereâ€Š

Since this approach was bungled up, maybe the â€œbig badâ€� went to plan B.

What if she was actually brought there to actually cause the explosionâ€Š With what we
know about River in the latter half of this season, she was set up to be a weapon to kill the Doctor
by the Silence. What if she has been brainwashed to destroy the TARDIS, most likely by the
post-hypnotic suggestion from the silence? What if she actually did her job by destroying the
universe only to have the Doctor undo it completely?

This also could explain why The TARDIS materialized in rock, maybe the TARDIS itself was
trying to protect everything from River, and put her in a time-loop.

This does sort of paint the Silence and the “villain alliance” in series 5 as heroes of some
sort, but what if that is true. What if they know of something The Doctor doesnâ€™t know
about â€“ something that is truly evil, and the REAL villain in this whole thing?
Something the Doctor unwittingly causes. I honestly think that there is an evil renegade
Timelord out there causing this whole mess, Omega, Rassilon, The Rani, The Master etcâ€Š

What if â€œSilence fallingâ€� is a bad thing
