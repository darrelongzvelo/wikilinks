Scored 1390 in GRE

Wasn't a tough task or it would have if i hadn't been preparing for it from past 6 months. Posers
were all around, gotta work your way through first 7 or 8 questions, than its all yours. -If you
lose marks in opening questions, its very difficult to get up. -Keep an eye on time. -There's
hardly any way of avoiding incorrect answers in Reading Comprehensions. WORDLIST is the
key..... -i revised 2500 words around 10 times and only then it was possible to remember almost
all of them. -i too was nervous because of lack of practice, but was confident of my vocabulary
that got me through. -i gave around 15 mock tests and ETS POWERPREP were the more exact
ones(that i gave a day before only). -keep your COOL and don't PANIC. My Scores for General GRE
on June 30,2011 Quantitative Aptitude- 800/800 [93 percentile] Verbal Aptitude-590/800
[85 percentile] Analytical Writing- yet to be evaluated. Overall percentile is hopefully
90+Best of luck to all

Fernando Torres? does Chelsea really need him

Fernando Torres

LIVERPOOL has lined up a remarkable Â£50 million ($79.7 million) worth of transfers for
deadline day as it prepares for life without Fernando Torres .Â Chelsea is willing to pay
cash to bring the disaffected Torres to Stamford Bridge in although not the amount that
Liverpool is seeking, which equates to the release clause in the 26-year-old’s contract
should the Anfield club fail to qualify for the Champions League this season.

But here is the point what is the point of including him when you have a prolific striker Didier
Drogba in form.

who to prefer between Torres and Drogba as the main inline forward..

you can’t keep either on bench and both are excellent finishers when it comes to scoring.

There is already a clash of egos between John Terry and Fernando Torres, but what on the earth
Roman Abramovic wants to prove, can’t he find some other field to waste his fortune.

It may sound awkward but ’tis the truthâ€Šâ€Šâ€Š.



Opted for Maths cuz I was even worse at Biology .

Image: http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_mad.gif?m=1129645325g

Later discovered that College and all meritorious stuff was really not my thing, I needed
something that is more practical and less theoretical ,

Sophisticated though I don’t careâ€Šâ€Š.

If I turn to 14 again than Instead of this Engineering, I would love to opt for my prioritized
list (better say “choice”) of professions:

1. Athlete (soccer)

2. Graphics Designer

3. Economist

4. Lobbyist

5. Surgeon (hereditary issue)



But I don’t have enough powers to turn this around and work it out as I wantedâ€Š.

o Now I am being pushed to get an MBA degree tooooo( click to Read )â€Šâ€Šâ€Š

mercy GOD!!!!

I was asleep the whole day for only to be disturbed by MOM â€Š. “CAT results are out, whats
urs???”

“(big WTF???)I have told you a lot of times that I am not interested in further studies and
also I HAVN’T FILLED A SINGLE FORM YET (money saver).. So no results”

But she insisted to do MBA and worse was still to come, they knew that I hadn’t applied for
anything so they have already nabbed a ‘ kin ADMISSION COUNSELOR
‘â€ŠÂ Â Â Â Â Â  now I know why she was asking me what college I wanted to
go to..

I told them that get me 5million to get into NMIMS [just because ratio is like 3 girls to a
boy]â€Š she said yeah go to Mumbai dad’s too interested and counselor told the price tag
around 35lacsâ€Š

I freaked out “I am not going anywhere” but

she told me “ Your DAD told him tat we are ready for Negotiation, but first pursue him (and
given my number to that bonker )”

The whole day was buggedâ€Š. Till now he has rung me atleast 20 times and sent me a dozen
mails for xlri, iipm, nmims, bimtech, s#*(*%……

This MULTIMILLION deal is awaiting my seal to get active, ohho wait its not getting through by
any meansâ€Šâ€Š.

Inspirational quotes #1

Life throws us a few curve balls every now and then, and the only way out is one day at a time.

Here are a few quotes I have found, some of which inspire and a few which make me giggle â€“
and thatâ€™s also a good thing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, but through it all I still
know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.Â  ~ Agatha Christie

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Itâ€™s not easy taking my problems one at a time when they refuse to get in line.Â  ~
Ashleigh Brilliant

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you break your neck, if you have nothing to eat, if your house is on fire, then you got a
problem.Â  Everything else is inconvenience.Â  ~ Robert Fulghum

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A bend in the road is not the end of the roadâ€Š unless you fail to make the turn.Â  ~Author
Unknown

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I know God will not give me anything I canâ€™t handle.Â  I just wish that He
didnâ€™t trust me so much.Â  ~ Mother Teresa

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright
morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life
implies.Â  ~ Erich Fromm

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesnâ€™t lead anywhere.Â 
~Frank A. Clark

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It just wouldnâ€™t be a picnic without the ants.Â  ~Author Unknown

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

one night with Yahoo Pipes..

Image via Wikipedia

I have read enough about Yahoo Pipes Engine but never tried cuz it sounded very complex to me.

@2100 hrs on the twentieth day of January , I was busy creating, burning and playing with feeds
until a thought struck “why shouldn’t I blog using rss feeds itself”

Talking about the feeds and pipes can’t be neglected. So do I made up my mind to finally get
head into the pipes engine

Deed #1 : My first was a very simple work. I picked up rss feeds from paulpierce.net and posted
them directly to my blog on tumblr. And my blog had same content as Paul Pierce’s blog and it
would automatically get updated with the exactly copied content(including images and
hypertexts) from the big blog. This was simple.

Play #2: Trying to be a real geek . Metallica’s blog provides only excerpts in its rss and not
the whole content. I needed to create a feed for the site matching my requirements, hence, so I
used the site itself to extract the whole text along with other primary attributes under
‘<span></span>’ and burned them. These were then mixed with output from previous pipe.

Output was this :

http://pipes.yahoo.com/adilansari/all_mashed

Now, after wasting 6 hours I have a tumblr blog that is synchronized in real time with: Paul
Pierce’s and Metallica’s blogâ€Š.

Hack#3: This was the time to monetize. I created a blog that was in real time synchronization
with major news websites. My blog can have news much more FASTER THAN BBC and CNNâ€Š..
“But unfortunately @6 AM I was CAUGHT by Reuters bot for Cyber Bullying and the bloody pipe
blasted offâ€Š..”

Faking Deathâ€Ša career ending Injury

Cautionary: Don’t get distracted by the title itself!!!!

 

18 November 2010, the low light of the setting sun wasn’t enough but the game was on as it was
supposed to be…

 

I already had my name on the scoring sheet and struck one on crossbar too, it was all looking
perfect unless i tried to wrap up the gameâ€Š

 

 

Wayne Rooney aka the selfish play:

Had the ball in my feet and from my half I started confident enough by the weak defense on the
other sideâ€Š.

 

Flapping the flips a Lionel Messi special:

Dodged two and running from wing to the centre, through the field I was attempting a fake twist
and turning all aroundâ€Š

 

Like a Michael Owen in the sky:

My knee drifted awkwardly, sounded like something has been forcibly plucked (ligaments they
were)â€Š

 

Half an hour later @ emergency ward of a medical college, beautiful girls used to be here every
time but to my badluck there was none right nowâ€Š.. Oh! Switching back to the topic-:

 

THE BLOODY KNEE WAS HANGING LOOSE

 

I had to be on a bedrest for 3 months before I could get on my feet and bend a kneeeeeâ€Š.

 

Probation from soccer for atleast a year..

 

If this isn’t DEATH than what it is???â€
