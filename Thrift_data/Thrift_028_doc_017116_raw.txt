[ edit ] Transmission and symptoms



Panleukopenia is primarily spread through contact with an infected cat's bodily fluids,
feces , or fleas . Sometimes it is spread through contact with bedding, food dishes, or even by
handlers of infected cats.

The virus primarily attacks the lining of the gastrointestinal tract , causing internal
ulceration and, ultimately, total sloughing of the intestinal epithelium . This results in
profuse and usually bloody diarrhea , severe dehydration , malnutrition , anemia , and often
death ;

The virus causes a decrease in the cat's white blood cells , thus compromising its immune
system . Typically, it also causes a decrease in hematocrit and platelet counts on a complete
blood count . This is often key in diagnosing panleukopenia.

Other symptoms include depression , lethargy , loss of appetite , fever , vomiting , loss of
skin elasticity due to dehydration and self-biting in the tail, lower back and back legs.

If a cat is exposed during pregnancy , the virus can cause cerebellar hypoplasia in her
offspring. This is why administering modified live feline panleukopenia vaccine during
pregnancy is discouraged.

It is impossible for a cat to spread Panleukopenia to a dog, as dogs cannot contract the virus. [

[ edit ] Diagnosis



Generally, a clinical diagnosis of feline panleukopenia [FPL] can be made based on
characteristic gastroenteric illness and severe pancytopenia in a susceptible cat, but
fecal analysis and blood culture is typically performed as well to rule out other illnesses.
Differential diagnoses for FPL include sallmenellosis , enteric toxosis, FIV , feline
leukemia , cryptospordiosis , pancreatitis , septicaemia with acute endotoxemia,
toxoplasmosis , peritonitis , and lymphoma. In a unvaccinated cat, the presence of
antibodies against FPLV indicate that the cat either has the disease or has had the disease in
the past, but in many cases subclinical disease occurs so this test is unreliable.

[ edit ] Vaccination

Further information: Feline vaccination

Protection is offered by commercial feline distemper vaccines ( ATCvet codes: QI06 AA02 for
the inactivated viral vaccine and QI06 AD01 for the live vaccine). A number of combination
vaccines for several different diseases, including panleukopenia, are also available.

[ edit ] Treatment



Feline panleukopenia requires aggressive treatment if the cat is to survive, as this disease
can kill cats in less than 24 hours. Treatment involves whole blood transfusion to improve
pancytopenia, intravenous fluids as most cats are dehydrated, injections of vitamins A , B ,
and C , IV antibiotics to prevent septicemia ,which develops in most cats with feline
panleukopenia if antibiotics are not used, and hospitalization .

[ edit ] Prognosis



Of affected kittens that are two months or less of age, 95% die regardless of treatment.
Kittens that are more than two months old have a 60-70% mortality rate with treatment and a
nearly 100% mortality rate if not treated. Adult cats have a 10-20% mortality rate if treated,
and an 85% mortality rate if not treated. Elderly cats have a 20-30% mortality rate if treated
and a 90% mortality rate if not treated.

[ edit ] Complications



Complications are quite common in feline panleukopenia [FPL]. The most prevalent one is
dehydration , which develops in almost all FPL-infected cats that are clinically ill.
Hyponatremia and other electrolyte disturbances are also quite common, as is hypotension ,
hyperpyrexia or, late in the disease, hypothermia . The patients' severe leukocytopenia
predispose them to secondary infections, especially bacterial and fungal, though
secondary viral infections also occur with some frequency. Disseminated intravascular
coagulation may also occur, and is often fatal. Extreme thrombocytopenia may also occur, and
can lead to severe hemorrhagic complications. Even if a cat survives acute FPL, late
complications such as cardiomyopathy and myocarditis can occur, though there have never
been any reported cases of hematologic or gastrointestinal sequalae, and it seems that late
myocarditis or cardiomyopathy is extremely rare in feline panleukopenia-affected cats.
Overall, any long-term sequalae in survivors of feline panleukopenia is extremely rare,
with almost all cats who survive making a full recovery.
