and Hardy in Way Out West (1937)

Laurel and Hardy were one of the most popular comedy teams of the early to mid Classical
Hollywood era of American cinema . Composed of thin, English-born Stan Laurel
(1890â€“1965) and heavy, American-born Oliver Hardy (1892â€“1957) they became
well known during the late 1920s to the mid-1940s for their work in motion pictures ; the team
also appeared on stage throughout America and Europe.

The two comedians first worked together on the film The Lucky Dog . After a period appearing
separately in several short films for the Hal Roach studio during the 1920s, they began
appearing in movie shorts together in 1926. [ 1 ] Laurel and Hardy officially became a team the
following year, and soon became Hal Roach's most lucrative stars. Among their most popular
and successful films were the features Sons of the Desert (1933), Way Out West (1937), and
Block-Heads (1938) [ 2 ] and the shorts Big Business (1929), Liberty (1929), and their Academy
Award-winning short, The Music Box (1932). [ 3 ]

The pair left the Roach studio in 1940, then appeared in eight "B" comedies for 20th Century Fox
and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1941 to 1945. [ 4 ] Disappointed in the films in which they had
little creative control, from 1946 to 1950 the team did not appear on film and concentrated on
their stage show, embarking on a musical hall tour of England, Ireland and Scotland. [ 4 ] They
made Atoll K , a French / Italian production and their last film, in 1950/1951, before retiring
from the screen. In total they appeared together in 106 films. They starred in 40 short sound
films , 32 short silent films and 23 full length feature films , and in the remaining 11 films
made guest or cameo appearances. [ 5 ]

[ edit ] Stan Laurel

Main article: Stan Laurel

Stan Laurel (June 16, 1890 â€“ February 23, 1965) was born Arthur Stanley Jefferson in
Ulverston , Lancashire (now Ulverston, Cumbria ), England . His father, Arthur J. "A.J."
Jefferson, was a showman who served as actor, director, playwright and theatrical
entrepreneur in many northern English cities.

Laurel began his career in the Glasgow Britannia Theatre of Varieties and Alhambra Theatre
Glasgow at the age of 16, where he crafted a comedy act largely derivative of famous music hall
comedians of the day, including George Robey and Dan Leno . He gradually worked his way up the
ladder of supporting roles until he became the featured comedian, as well as an understudy to
Charlie Chaplin in Fred Karno 's comedy company. [ 6 ] He emigrated to America in 1912 where he
decided to change his name; he worried that "Stanley Jefferson" was too long to fit onto
posters. He shortened it to "Stan" and added "Laurel" at the suggestion of his superstitious
vaudeville partner, Mae Dahlberg who fretted that his original stage name was composed of 13
letters. [ 7 ]

Making his first film appearance in Nuts in May (1917), Laurel continued to make more than 50
other silent films for various producers. [ 8 ] At first he experienced only modest success as a
solo comedian. Producer Hal Roach later attributed this to the difficulty in photographing
Laurel's pale blue eyes on early pre- panchromatic film stock, perhaps giving the appearance
of blindness (which, in his earliest films, Laurel tried to remedy by adding heavy defining
makeup around his eyes). Moreover, Laurel did not have an identifiable or easily marketable
screen character, like that of Chaplin , Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton .

It was only when Laurel began appearing in satires of popular screen dramas that audiences
really took notice of him. Between 1922 and 1925 he starred in a number of films including Mud
and Sand (1922) (a parody of Blood and Sand , featuring Stan as "Rhubarb Vaselino") and Dr.
Pyckle and Mr. Pryde (1925) (with Stan playing both the gentle doctor and the manic monster).
Many of these comedies had crazy visual gags along with Laurel's eccentric pantomime,
establishing the star as an inspired "nut comic."

[ edit ] Oliver Hardy

Main article: Oliver Hardy

Oliver Hardy (January 18, 1892 â€“ August 7, 1957) was born Norvell Hardy in Harlem,
Georgia . [ 9 ] As a tribute to his father (who died when Norvell was very young), he took his
father's first name (although not legally), henceforth calling himself "Oliver Norvell
Hardy." His offscreen nicknames were "Ollie" and "Babe."

Hardy's nickname "Babe" originated during his (pre-Laurel) early silent film career. Hardy
was a frequent visitor to an Italian barbershop near the Lubin Studios in Jacksonville,
Florida where he worked. After cutting his hair and giving him a shave, the barber would then
pat his face with talcum powder whilst saying, "That's nice a baby!" With the barber's Italian
accent, "baby" sounded like "Babe." That nickname stuck with Hardy for the rest of his life.
Hardy was billed as "Babe Hardy" in his early films. [ 10 ] In some of the duo's first silent
films, Laurel can be seen mouthing the word "Babe" when calling out to Ollie.

By his late teens, Hardy was a popular stage singer, and he operated his own movie house in
Milledgeville, Georgia , the Palace Theater, financed partially by his mother. [ 11 ] Seeing
film comedies inspired him with an urge to take up comedy himself and in 1913, he began working
with Lubin Motion Pictures in Jacksonville, Florida. He started out by helping around the
studio with lights, props and other duties, gradually learning the craft as a script-clerk. [
11 ] Around the same time, he married his first wife, Madelyn Salosihn. [ 12 ]

In 1914, Babe acted in his first film called Outwitting Dad . [ 10 ] Between 1914 and 1916, Babe
made 177 shorts with the Vim Comedy Company , which were released up to the end of 1917. [ 13 ]
Exhibiting a versatility in playing heroes, villains and even female characters, Hardy
became much in demand as a supporting actor, comic villain or second banana . For the next 10
years he memorably assisted star comics Billy West , a Charlie Chaplin imitator, Jimmy Aubrey
, Larry Semon and Charley Chase . [ 14 ] In total, Hardy starred or co-starred in more than 250
silent shorts, about 150 of which have been lost. While in New York, his abortive effort to
enlist in 1917 led him and his wife, Madelyn, to seek new opportunities in California. [ 15 ]
Hardy became a member of Hal Roach 's stock company when he began working regularly with Stan
Laurel.

Image: http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png Laurel
and Hardy in their 1939 feature film The Flying Deuces .

The first film pairing of the two comedians (albeit as separate performers) took place in The
Lucky Dog , produced in 1919 by Sun-Lite Pictures and released in 1921. [ 16 ] Several years
later, both comedians appeared in the Hal Roach production 45 Minutes from Hollywood (1926).
Their first "official" film together was Putting Pants on Philip , although their first
appearance as the now familiar "Stan and Ollie" characters was The Second Hundred Years (June
1927), directed by Fred Guiol and supervised by Leo McCarey , who suggested that the
performers be teamed permanently.

Hal Roach kept them a team for the next decade, making silent shorts, talking shorts, and
feature films. While most silent-film actors saw their careers decline with the advent of
sound, Laurel and Hardy made a successful transition in 1929 with the short Unaccustomed As We
Are . Laurel's English accent and Hardy's Southern American accent and singing brought new
dimensions to their characters. The team also proved skillful in their melding of visual and
verbal humor, adding dialogue that served to enhance rather than replace their popular sight
gags.

Laurel and Hardy's shorts, produced by Hal Roach and initially released through Pathé and
then in 1929 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , were among the most successful in the business. Most of the
shorts ran two reels (10 minutes per reel), although several ran three reels long, and one,
Beau Hunks , was four reels long. In 1929, they appeared for the first time in a feature as one of
the acts in The Hollywood Revue of 1929 and the following year, they appeared as the comic
relief in a lavish all- Technicolor musical feature entitled: The Rogue Song . This film
marked their first appearance in color. Considered a "lost film", only a few fragments of this
production have survived, along with the complete soundtrack. In 1931, Laurel and Hardy's
first starring feature was released, Pardon Us . Following its success, the duo made fewer
shorts in order to concentrate on feature films, which included Pack Up Your Troubles (1932),
Fra Diavolo (or The Devil's Brother , 1933), Sons of the Desert (1933), and Babes in Toyland
(1934). [ 1 ] Their classic short The Music Box , released in 1932, won the first Academy Award
for Best Short Subject, (Comedy).

Because the popularity of the double feature diminished the demand for short subjects, Hal
Roach cancelled all of his shorts series, save for Our Gang . The final short in the Laurel and
Hardy series was 1935's Thicker than Water . The duo's subsequent feature films included
Bonnie Scotland (1935), The Bohemian Girl (1936), Our Relations (1936), Way Out West (1937)
(which includes the famous song "Trail of the Lonesome Pine"), Swiss Miss (1938) and
Block-Heads (1938).

[ edit ] Style of comedy and notable routines

Main article: Laurel and Hardy: Style of comedy and characterizations

The humor of Laurel and Hardy was generally visual with slapstick used for emphasis. They
often had physical arguments with each other, which were quite complex and involved cartoon
violence . Their characters preclude them from making any real progress in even the simplest
endeavors. Much of their comedy involves milking a joke, where a simple idea provides a basis
from which to build several gags. Many of their films have extended sequences constructed
around a single problem the pair is facing, without following a defined narrative . Laurel did
most of the planning and construction of gags while Hardy was more limited in his
contributions to the comedy routines. [ 12 ]

A common routine the team often performed was a " tit-for-tat " fight with an adversary.
Typically, Laurel and Hardy accidentally damaged someone else's property. The injured
party would retaliate by ruining something belonging to Laurel or Hardy, who would calmly
survey the damage and find something else to vandalize . The conflict would escalate until
both sides were simultaneously destroying property in front of each other. An early example
of the routine occurs in their classic short, Big Business (1929), which was added to the
Library of Congress as a national treasure in 1992, and one of their short films, which
revolves entirely around such an altercation, was titled Tit for Tat (1935).

In some cases, their comedy bordered on the surreal, a style Stan Laurel called "white magic."
[ 17 ] For example, in Way Out West (1937), Laurel clenches his fist and pours tobacco into it, as
if it were a pipe. Then, he flicks his thumb upward as if he held a lighter . His thumb ignites, and
he matter-of-factly lights his "pipe." The amazed Hardy, seeing this, would unsuccessfully
attempt to duplicate it throughout the rest of the film. Much later in the film, Hardy finally
succeeds - only to be terrified when his thumb catches fire.

Rather than showing Hardy suffering the pain of misfortunes such as falling down stairs or
being beaten by a thug, banging and crashing sound effects were often used so the audience
could visualize the scene for themselves. Routines frequently performed by Laurel were a
high pitched whooping when in peril and crying like an infant when being berated by Hardy.
Hardy often looked directly at the camera , breaking the fourth wall , to express his
frustration with Laurel to the film audience .

[ edit ] On-screen characterizations

Main article: Laurel and Hardy: Style of comedy and characterizations

Laurel and Hardy's onscreen personas are of two dim but eternally optimistic men, secure in
their perpetual and impregnable innocence. Their humor is physical, but their
accident-prone buffoonery is distinguished by their affable personalities and mutual
devotion; essentially "children" in an adult world.

Laurel and Hardy had an inherent physical contrariety which was enhanced with small touches.
Laurel kept his hair short on the sides and back, but let it grow long on top to create a natural
"fright wig" through his inveterate gesture of scratching his head at moments of shock or
wonderment and simultaneously pulling up his hair. In contrast, Hardy's thinning hair was
pasted on his forehead in spit curls and he wore a toothbrush moustache . To achieve a
flat-footed walk, Laurel removed the heels from his shoes (usually Army shoes). Stan Laurel
was of average height and weight, but appeared small and slight next to Oliver Hardy, who was
6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) tall [ 18 ] and weighed about 280 lb (127 kg) in his prime. Both wore
Bowler hats , with Laurel's being narrower than Hardy's, and with a flattened brim. The
characters' normal attire also called for wing collar shirts, with Hardy wearing a standard
neck tie which he would twiddle and Laurel a bow tie . Hardy's sports jacket was too small for him
and done up with one straining button, whereas Laurel's double breasted jacket was loose
fitting.

Part of Laurel and Hardy's onscreen images called for their faces to be filmed flat, without
any shadows or dramatic lighting. To invoke a traditional clown -like appearance, both
comedians wore a light pancake makeup on their faces, and Roach's cameramen, such as Art Lloyd
and Francis Corby, were instructed to light and film a scene so that facial lines and wrinkles
would be "washed out." Art Lloyd was once quoted as saying, "Well, I'll never win an Oscar, but
I'll sure please Stan Laurel."

Offscreen, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were quite the opposite of their movie characters:
Laurel was the industrious "idea man," while Hardy was more easygoing. [ 19 ] Although Hal
Roach employed writers and directors such as H.M. Walker , Leo McCarey , James Parrott , James
W. Horne , and others on Laurel and Hardy films, Laurel would rewrite entire sequences or
scripts, have the cast and crew improvise on the soundstage, and meticulously review the
footage for editing, often moonlighting to achieve all of these tasks. While Hardy did
contribute to the routines, [ 19 ] he was generally content to follow Laurel's lead and spent
most of his free time on hobbies such as golf.

[ edit ] Later films

Main article: Laurel and Hardy: Later feature films

By 1936, although the relationship between Laurel and Hardy remained strong, Laurel's
dealings with producer Roach became strained amid a tangle of artistic differences. Roach
insisted that his feature-length comedies should also contain musical numbers and/or
subplots. (Roach always contended that if you watched any comedian for an hour at a time,
"you'd be bored to hell with him.") Laurel maintained that such padding distracted from the
team's comedy. Because of this friction, extended stand-off periods became common during
the late 1930s, with Roach occasionally threatening to pair Hardy with someone else.

Laurel countered Roach's announcement with one revealing his own plans. In October 1938,
Roach's old rival Mack Sennett announced that he had signed Laurel to star in comedy features
for his new Sennett Pictures Corporation Studio. [ 20 ] Those films were not made, since by
April 1939 the dispute between Laurel and Roach was settled and the comedy team was again
intact for further work with Roach. They made two more films for Roach, A Chump at Oxford
(filmed in 1939, released 1940) and Saps at Sea (1940). Both of these films were released
through United Artists , as Roach's distribution arrangement with MGM had ended in 1938. As
their new agreement with Roach was non-exclusive, Laurel and Hardy also starred in The Flying
Deuces , a feature-length remake of Beau Hunks produced and released by RKO Radio Pictures .

Hoping for greater artistic freedom, Laurel and Hardy split with Roach and signed with major
studios 20th Century-Fox and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. However, the working conditions were
now completely different, as they were hired only as actors, relegated to the B-film
divisions, and initially not allowed to improvise or contribute to the scripts. When the
films proved popular, the studios allowed the team more input with Laurel and Hardy starring
in eight features through 1944. These films, while not considered the team's best, were
extremely successful. Budgeted at $250,000 to $300,000 each, the films earned millions at
the box office. The films were so profitable that Fox kept making Laurel and Hardy comedies
after discontinuing its other "B" series.

After spending the rest of the 1940s performing on stage in Europe, Laurel and Hardy made one
final film together in 1950. Atoll K , later reissued in abridged form in the United States as
Utopia , released in 1954, was a French-Italian co-production directed by Leo Joannon, which
was plagued by language barriers, production problems, and both Laurel and Hardy's grave
health issues during shooting. Hardy began to lose weight precipitously and developed an
irregular heartbeat while Laurel experienced painful prostate complications. [ 21 ]
Critics were disappointed with its storyline, English dubbing, and Laurel's sickly
physical appearance with his weight down to 114 pounds (52 kg; 8.1 st). [ 18 ] The film was not a
success, and brought an end to Laurel and Hardy's film careers, yet due to copyright problems
in the United States, the film became available under the provisions of public domain , and was
widely distributed by small distributors, remaining the most easily available of the team's
features. [ 21 ]

[ edit ] Final years



After Atoll K , Laurel and Hardy took several months off, so that Laurel could recuperate. Upon
their return to the European stage, they undertook a successful series of public appearances
in short sketches Laurel had written: "A Spot of Trouble" (in 1952) and "Birds of a Feather" (in
1953). [ 22 ]

Silhouette portrait of the duo in Redcar , England

On December 1, 1954, the team made their only American television appearance, surprised by
Ralph Edwards on his live NBC-TV program, This Is Your Life . Lured to the Knickerbocker Hotel
as a subterfuge for a business meeting with producer Bernard Delfont , the doors opened to
their suite #205, flooding the room with light and the voice of Ralph Edwards. At first the boys
reacted incredulously, like deer caught in headlights. From the moment the boys realized
they're on camera, Stan smiles graciously, and did so all night. Ollie comically drinks the
rest of his "beverage" before hurriedly being ushered to an awaiting car on Ivar Ave, to the
Hollywood Blvd.'s El Capitan theatre down the street, for their night of tribute. The
telecast was preserved on a kinescope and later released on home video. Partly due to the
positive response from the television broadcast, the pair was renegotiating with Hal Roach
Jr. for a series of color NBC television specials to be called Laurel and Hardy's Fabulous
Fables . However, plans for the specials were shelved, as the aging comedians suffered from
declining health. [ 22 ]

In 1955, Laurel and Hardy made their final public appearance together, taking part in a BBC
television program about the Grand Order of Water Rats , the British variety organization,
titled This is Music Hall . Laurel and Hardy provide a filmed insert during which they
reminisce about their friends in British variety. They made their final appearance on camera
in 1956 in a home movie titled "One Moment Please". The film was shot by a family friend at Stan's
home, it is without audio and lasts three minutes.

Under doctor's orders to improve a heart condition, Hardy lost over 100 pounds (45 kg; 7.1
st) in 1956. Several strokes (that some doctors partly attribute to the rapid weight loss)
resulted in loss of mobility and speech. He died of a major stroke on August 7, 1957. Longtime
friend Bob Chatterton said Hardy weighed just 138 pounds (63 kg; 9.9 st) at the time of his
death. A depressed Laurel did not attend his partner's funeral, due to his own ill health,
explaining his absence with the line "Babe would understand." Hardy was laid to rest at Pierce
Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park, North Hollywood. [ 23 ]

Just after Hardy's death, Laurel and Hardy returned to movie theaters, as clips of their work
were featured in Robert Youngson 's silent-film compilation The Golden Age of Comedy . For the
remaining eight years of his life, Stan Laurel refused to perform, even turning down Stanley
Kramer 's offer to make a cameo in his landmark 1963 movie, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World . In
1960, Laurel was given a special Academy Award for his contributions to film comedy. Despite
not appearing onscreen after Hardy's death, Laurel did contribute gags to several comedy
filmmakers. He also kept his comedic instincts and skills sharp by continuing to write
"Laurel and Hardy" gags and scenarios, even though he knew they would never be performed and
would seldom be shared with anyone other than close friends and associates. Most of his
writing was in the form of correspondence; he insisted on answering every fan letter
personally. Late in life, he hosted many visitors of the new generation of comedians and
celebrities, including Dick Cavett , Jerry Lewis , Peter Sellers , Marcel Marceau and Dick Van
Dyke . Laurel lived until 1965, surviving to see the duo's work rediscovered through
television and classic film revivals. He died in Santa Monica , and is buried at Forest
Lawn-Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles , California . [ 24 ]

[ edit ] Foreign language films



A number of their films were reshot with Laurel and Hardy talking in Spanish , Italian , French
or German . The plots for these films were similar to the English language version although the
supporting cast were often native language actors. Laurel and Hardy couldn't speak a foreign
language and they received voice coaching to reproduce their lines. Pardon Us (1931) was
reshot in all four foreign languages. Blotto (1930), Chickens Come Home (1931) and Below Zero
(1930) had a French and Spanish version. These film versions helped to boost the duoâ€™s
popularity internationally.

In some languages they are known by their English names, however in Spanish they are known as
"El Gordo y El Flaco" ("the fat one and the skinny one"), in Italian as "Stanlio & Ollio", and in
Swedish and Norwegian as "Helan & Halvan" ("The Whole One" and "The Half One"). In Danish, they
are known as "Gøg og Gokke" and in Polish as "Flip i Flap". In German, they were known as "Dick
und Doof" ("Fatty and Idiot") until the 1970s, then as "Stan & Ollie" or by their English names.

[ edit ] Lost films



Most of the Laurel and Hardy films survive, and have never gone out of circulation
permanently. Three of their 106 films are considered lost , as they have not been seen in full
since the 1930s. The silent Hats Off (1927) has vanished completely. The first half of Now I'll
Tell One (1927) is lost and the second half has yet to be released on video. In the operatic
Technicolor musical The Rogue Song (1930) Laurel and Hardy appear in 10 sequences, only one of
which is known to exist. Two other films have missing content although they aren't considered
lost. Duck Soup (1927) was considered lost until a print was discovered in the mid-1970s, this
print appears to be missing a few minutes of footage at the beginning and end. The Battle of the
Century (1927) has several minutes of missing footage bridging the first and second halves,
and the final half-minute is also missing.

[ edit ] Music

Main article: Laurel and Hardy music

Although uncredited, the composer Leroy Shield composed the great majority of the music used
in the Laurel and Hardy films. A compilation of songs from their films titled Trail of the
Lonesome Pine was released in 1975.

The duo's famous signature tune, known variously as "The Cuckoo Song", "Ku-Ku", or "The Dance
of the Cuckoos", was composed by Roach musical director Marvin Hatley as the on-the-hour
chime for the Roach studio radio station. Laurel heard the tune on the station, and asked
Hatley to use it as the Laurel and Hardy theme song. In Laurel's eyes, the song's melody
represented Hardy's character (pompous and dramatic), while the harmony represented
Laurel's own character (somewhat out of key, and only able to register two notes: "coo-coo").
The original theme, recorded by two clarinets in 1930, was re-recorded with a full orchestra
in 1935.

[ edit ] Influence and legacy



[ edit ] Catchphrases



The catchphrase most used by Laurel and Hardy on film is: â€œ Well, that's another nice
mess you've gotten me into! â€�

The phrase was first used in The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case (1930). In popular culture the
catchphrase is often misquoted as "Well, here's another fine mess you've gotten me into." The
misquoted version of the phrase was very rarely used by Ollie; the misunderstanding stems
from the title of Another Fine Mess (1930). [ 25 ] Numerous variations of the quote appeared on
film. In Chickens Come Home (1931), Ollie says impatiently to Stan, "Well...." with Stan
replying, "Here's another nice mess I've gotten you into." In Thicker than Water (1935) and
The Fixer-Uppers (1935) the phrase becomes "Well, here's another nice kettle of fish you
pickled me in!". In Saps at Sea (1940) it becomes "Well, here's another nice bucket of suds
you've gotten me into!". â€œ D'oh! â€�

"D'oh!" is a catchphrase used by James Finlayson , the mustachioed Scottish actor who
appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. The word was used as a replacement for "Damn!". His
catchphrase was the inspiration for "D'oh!" as spoken by the fictional character Homer
Simpson in the long running animated comedy The Simpsons . The Simpson's first intentional
use of "d'oh!" occurred in the Ullman short "Punching Bag" (1988). [ 26 ]

[ edit ] The Sons of the Desert

Main article: The Sons of the Desert

The official Laurel and Hardy appreciation society is known as The Sons of the Desert , after a
fraternal society in their film of the same name (1933). It was founded in New York City in 1965
by Laurel & Hardy biographer John McCabe , Orson Bean , Al Kilgore , Chuck McCann and John
Municino; with the sanction of Stan Laurel. Since the group's inception, well over 150
chapters of the organization have formed across North America, Europe and Australia. An
Emmy-winning film documentary about the group, Revenge of the Sons of the Desert , has been
released on DVD as part of The Laurel and Hardy Collection, Vol. 1.

[ edit ] Posthumous revivals



Since the 1930s, the works of Laurel and Hardy have been re-released in numerous theatrical
reissues, television revivals (broadcast, especially public television, and cable), 16mm
and 8mm home movies, feature-film compilations, and home video. After Stan Laurel's death in
1965, there were two major motion-picture tributes: Laurel and Hardy's Laughing '20s ,
Robert Youngson's compilation of the team's silent-film highlights; and The Great Race , a
large-scale salute to slapstick which director Blake Edwards dedicated to "Mr. Laurel and
Mr. Hardy." For many years the duo were impersonated by Jim MacGeorge (as Laurel) and Chuck
McCann (as Hardy) in television commercials for various products. [ 27 ]

Merchandiser Larry Harmon claimed ownership of Laurel's and Hardy's likenesses, and issued
Laurel and Hardy toys and colouring books. He co-produced a series of Laurel and Hardy
cartoons in 1966 with Hanna-Barbera Productions . [ 28 ] His animated versions of Laurel and
Hardy also guest-starred in a 1972 episode of Hanna-Barbera's The New Scooby-Doo Movies . In
1999, Harmon produced a direct-to-video feature, the live-action comedy The All-New
Adventures of Laurel and Hardy: For Love or Mummy , with actors Bronson Pinchot and Gailard
Sartain playing the lookalike nephews of the original Laurel and Hardy, Stanley Thinneus
Laurel and Oliver Fatteus Hardy. [ 29 ]

[ edit ] Colorized versions



Many Laurel and Hardy films have been colorized . Helpmates (1932) was the first film to
undergo the process, it was experimented upon by Colorization Inc., a subsidiary of Hal Roach
Studios in 1983. Colorization became a success for the studio and Helpmates was released on
home video with the colorized version of The Music Box (1932) in 1986. The technology for this
process was inferior compared to today's digital colorization technology. There were
numerous continuity errors and garish color design choices. However the most significant
criticism that these versions received revolved around their editing, whole scenes were
altered or deleted altogether, changing the character of the film.

    Kingdom, [ 30 ] and the other in Hardy's birthplace, Harlem, Georgia, United States [ 31 ]

    

    

    - Laurel and Hardy's likenesses have made frequent "cameo appearances" in animated
    cartoons and comic strips since the 1930s. They featured in a Laurel and Hardy cartoon
    series by Hanna-Barbera and made a guest appearance in The New Scooby-Doo Movies . From
    Mickey Mouse to Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies to Woody Woodpecker , caricatured
    versions of the comedians appeared as walk-on characters and sometimes in supporting
    roles in cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation . Laurel and Hardy have also
    turned up in more recent works such as the Asterix album Obelix and Co. , Mark Dindal 's
    animated film Cats Don't Dance (1997), Berkeley Breathed 's comic strip Bloom County ,
    Gary Larson 's comic strip The Far Side and The Simpsons episode The Wandering Juvie .

    

    

    - In one of the few instance of incorporating the famous duo's visages into popular
    literature, author/illustrator Maurice Sendak 's In the Night Kitchen (1970) [ 32 ]
    showed three identical Oliver Hardy figures as bakers preparing cakes for the morning in
    his award-winning children's book and is treated as a clear example of "interpretative
    illustration" wherein the comedians' inclusion harkened back to the author's own
    childhood. Sendak described his early upbringing as sitting in movie houses fascinated
    by the Laurel and Hardy comedies. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]

    

    

    - Laurel and Hardy were featured alongside many other celebrities in cutout form for the
    cover of the Beatles 's 1967 masterpiece album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band . Of
    the two, Stan is more recognizable.

    

    

    - In 1976, STV (Scottish Television) produced a half-hour play by Alex Norton called
    Stan's First Night , about a 16-year-old Stan Jefferson's (Stan Laurel's real name)
    first appearance on stage at the Panopticon variety theatre in Glasgow .

    

    

    - Kurt Vonnegut 's 1976 novel Slapstick not only owes its title to the "grotesque
    situational poetry" of Laurel and Hardy's film comedies, but also bears the dedication
    to "the memory of Arthur Stanley Jefferson and Norvell Hardy, two angels of my time" and
    features the 1975 caricature of the pair by Al Hirschfeld on the page opposite.

    

    

    - Based on a 2005 poll of the top 50 comedians featured in The Comedian's Comedian , a TV
    documentary broadcast on UK's Channel 4 on January 1, 2005, the duo was voted the seventh
    greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders, making them the most
    popular double act on the list. [ 35 ]

    

    

    - In 2006, BBC in the UK broadcast a drama Stan about Laurel's final visit to see the dying
    Hardy. The TV programme derived from a radio play first broadcast in 2004. Both radio and
    TV versions were written by Neil Brand .

    

    

    - In Indian (Hindi) comicstrip culture, the most well known pair of foolhardy jokers:
    Mottoo and Patlu à€®à¥‹à€Ÿà¥‚ à€”à€°
    à€ªà€€à€²à¥‚ (The Fat Guy and the Thin Guy) were inspired by Laurel
    and Hardy.
