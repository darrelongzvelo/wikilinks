Day 129: Looking Up At Apollo 10

Launched in May, 1969, The Apollo 10 mission was critical to executing the successful July
moon landing. But what about that trio of astronauts whose names are anything but household,
who took the run before the big run? On the one hand, these three men strapped themselves into a
capsule the size of a Buickâ€™s trunk and allowed themselves to be fired into space, so
they have nothing to prove to anybody. In fact, they should probably be allowed to eat for free
at every Dennyâ€™s across the country. Iâ€™m just saying.

But on the other hand, the Apollo 11 astronauts are the rock stars of NASA. Armstrong is the
coolest Neil this side of Young, and Buzz Aldrin dropped a record with Snoop Dogg . Why
donâ€™t the Apollo 10 guys get some love?

Luckily, Iâ€™m stuffed with so much love I literally have to wear a bib while I write every
day.

This one. Because it always makes me laugh.

NASA set up Apollo 10 as a test-run for the moon landing. They ran everything as though they were
going to drop onto the lunar surface, but without the actual landing. In fact, NASA wanted to
make sure these cowboys didnâ€™t pull a what-are-they-gonna-do-to-us move and drop
the lunar module to the surface; they purposely left almost no fuel in the LMâ€™s tank.
That way, they could execute their simulation exercises, but if they decided to go rogue,
theyâ€™d never be able to lift off.

The missionâ€™s captain, Thomas P. Stafford, is what youâ€™d call an
overachiever. He flew on six space missions, including the first US-Soviet joint mission in
1975. He was also a brigadier general at the time â€“ the first general to ever get
launched outside Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Suddenly all those hours I spent practicing
the ultra-fast lyrics of REMâ€™s â€œItâ€™s The End Of The World As We Know
Itâ€� seem like a waste.

Stafford, seen here showing off an actual-size model of one of his testicles.

John Young piloted the command module. If John felt slighted for having been a part of the
mission before the mission that landed on the moon, that was probably quickly dissipated by
the fact that yeah, he landed on the damn moon.

John Young is the guy they should rename the profession of â€˜astronautâ€™ after.
Heâ€™s the only guy to have flown four different spacecraft: a Gemini, the Apollo
rocket, the lunar module, and the space shuttle. He was a rebel too; he smuggled a corned beef
sandwich aboard the Gemini and got his hand slapped for it.

Image: http://1000words1000days.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JohnYoung.jpg

I suspect when John Young slaps a jukebox, it starts playing a Bobby Darin record.

During the Apollo 10 mission, John became the first person to orbit the moon solo, chilling in
the command module (possibly with a knish and a pickle) while the other two guys flew the lunar
module. For Apollo 13, John was part of the backup crew, executing numerous tests and
simulations to ensure a safe return for Tom Hanks and his team. He flew back to the moon on the
Apollo 16 mission, and set a speed record for the lunar rover, no doubt taking it off some sweet
jumps.

At 42 years, John had the longest career as an astronaut ever, and he wants you to know that
heâ€™s really impressed that you were able to submit those quarterly forecast
projection reports on time. Pussy.

Eugene Cernan, who piloted the lunar module for Apollo 10, got a chance to tread his tootsies on
the moonâ€™s surface also, as commander of the Apollo 17 mission. In fact, he gambled by
giving up his spot as lunar module pilot on Apollo 16 because he wanted to command the final
Apollo mission. On that trip, Eugene first broke Johnâ€™s lunar land-speed record,
then became the last man to leave the moonâ€™s surface (not counting those dudes who were
killed in Superman II ). He also netted a mention on TVâ€™s Modern Family as the best dad
ever, for leaving his daughterâ€™s initials on the lunar surface before he left.

Thanks Eugene. Now my kids hate me.

If, like me, youâ€™re feeling a little bit smaller for reading the numerous
accomplishments by these three guys, donâ€™t worry. Thatâ€™s not
â€œdonâ€™t worryâ€� because I have some scandal for any of them â€“ far
as I can tell, theyâ€™ve never even been caught speeding â€“ but rather
â€œdonâ€™t worryâ€� because Iâ€™ve only got 300 words left, then we can
all go out and get drunk and talk about that time we stuffed 23 Cheetos in our mouths at once and I
bet Eugene Cernan canâ€™t even do that so there. (Though for the record, I bet John Young
can)

Three astronauts were also logged in as Apollo 10â€™s backup crew. If the Apollo 10
mission was the almost-moon show, these guys had to feel doubly rotten. By tradition, the
backup crew for 10 should have been the primary crew for 13, but NASA switched things up. Only
the crewâ€™s scheduled lunar module pilot, Edgar Mitchell, nabbed a chance to mosey on
the moon. His re-assignment from Apollo 13 to Apollo 14 was a great stroke of luck, even if it
meant not having Kevin Bacon portray him in a movie. Gary Cole played him in From The Earth To The
Moon, and thatâ€™s almost as good.

Pictured here, telling Alan Sheperd he'll need to stay late to finish up his TPS reports.

So what else did Apollo 10 accomplish, besides setting the table for the Apollo 11 crew to chow
down on history? Actually, lots.

The rocket carried the first color TV camera into space, which captured the action
brilliantly for those back home. They nudged the lunar module to within eight and a half miles
of the lunar surface, and grabbed the final calculations needed to make sure Armstrong and
Aldrin didnâ€™t ram the surface like a bumper car. Also, the names of the command module
and lunar module were Charlie Brown and Snoopy, which allowed for this brilliant photograph
to occur on their way to the rocket:

The three astronauts set a Guinness record for the fastest manned vehicle ever, clocking in at
24,791mph on re-entry. That record still stands. Also, because of both the distance between
the Earth and moon and the rotation of the Earth at the time, these three have the record for the
furthest anyone has ever been from their home in human history (about 254,110 miles).

So next time someoneâ€™s dropping the Armstrong card, or even the John Glenn card,
remind them that Stafford, Young and Cernan were not the almost-guys. They were the guys.
These three are every bit the role model and hero that our countryâ€™s celebrities will
never be (in spite of every effort made by their publicists to convince us otherwise).

    Also, come on Dennyâ€™s. Unlimited Moons Over My-Hammy for life for these three.
    Get with it.

        I'm not a fan of the hexagon. I once tried putting cinnamon in mashed potatoes to see if
        it would taste good. It didn't. I feel somewhat emasculated when I'm entering a
        password for the first time, and the site tells me it's not a strong enough password. I
        can juggle, but only for about three or four seconds. I like cars, and my dream vehicle
        would be shaped like the Chrysler Building, but a little sportier. Also,
        horizontal.
