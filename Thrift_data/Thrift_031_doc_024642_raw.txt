If you are in the East Bay on President’s Day weekend, and want to drive to San Francisco, you
are gonna have to fill up the tank before you get on the freeway. Â Unfortunately the Bay
Bridge is being shut down for the latest and greatest repairs at 8pm on February 17th and
re-opening at 5am on Tuesday February 21st. Â This means 3.5 days of driving south to the San
Mateo bridge if you have to take your car.

On the flip side their could be a weather issue. Â It seems the repair they are making this go
round requires good weather, so the closure could be cancelled if mother nature doesn’t
cooperate. Â All you need to do is to check out Â  http://baybridgeinfo.org/ . Â on the
17th to see if they are still on schedule. Â If all goes well, and the rain clouds don’t show
their faces, I will see you in traffic on Monday morning!

http://www.myessentia.com/blog/berkeley/files/2011/10/Giggity-Giggity1.gif So you
thought you had seen it all?Â  Well then, I have a treat for you!

Going down (no pun intended) tonight in San Francisco are the Air Sex Championships .Â  Take
a moment to let that settle in…Â  Can you say Giggity Giggity?

So you thought air guitar was as far as it would go?Â  Well you didn’t think online dating
would be considered normal, now did you?Â  So here’s the scoop.Â  You have 2 minutes,
your own soundtrack, and a simulated climax standing in your way.Â  If you can do it better,
wilder, funnier, sexier? You will be crowned champion of your city.

That’s just the beginning.Â  Can you say Regionals? If you can really get your groove on,
you are headed to Austin, TX for the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS!Â  Did you ever think you would be a
world champion of anything?Â  Let’s face it, if you are at all considering taking part in
this contest, the answer is no.

So dust off your Barry White records, and poor yourself a glass of the finest cavasier, it’s
about to get funky!Â  Check out the Elbo Room in San Francisco for an opportunity to leave
your hater mark in the history books.Â  If you can’t make it there, you have another
opportunity to get crunk with your junk in Oakland next Tuesday October 18th.

If you are able to make either show, we would love to hear about the experience.Â  Please
leave G-Rated comments about all that you see.

It’s A Bird, It’s A Plane, It’s An Angel?

I am sure that if you were anywhere in the Bay Area yesterday you heard the unmistakable roar of
F/A-18C Hornets over head. Â That can mean one of two things. Â Either Uncle Sam is after
you, or Fleet Week 2011 has arrived!

If you haven’t been to Fleet Week before that is a shame, and I pretty sure that it’s
considered a crime. Â So don’t be missing out this year. Â My suggestion would be to hop
on Bart and head out to Pier 39 ASAP. Â You just need to check out the complete schedule for the
show and plan accordingly.

So what can you expect to see when you get there? Â The finest display of military and
engineering precision that your tax dollars can buy. Â Granted, not everyone is pro
military, but there is something about a jet flying 1000 ft over your head at 500 mph that just
makes you smile (and the ground shake).

So check out the Parade of Ships , the Disaster Response Demonstration , the Band Challenge ,
and of course the Air Show . Â The Blue Angels are probably the biggest attraction, but you
can’t forget about all the other very cool aircraft that will be on display this year. Â So
keep your eye out for an F-15E Strike Eagle , anÂ  F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , and the always
illusiveÂ  USAF B-2 Bomber .
