Story of the Day



Mayo called while dad was power washing outside.Â  The nurse told dad that his counts were
down with Chemo and said he should be feeling bad.Â  He walked in and asked my mom if he should
come inside and lay down or something.Â  Mom said, Earl, do whatever you feel like
doing.Â  He went back to power washing.Â  Â

frustration due to the ignorance that i have encountered during this last week. In my last Blog
i mentioned that i am due a cystoscopy within the next three weeks well this will not happen due
to the fact that last Sunday morning i was admitted to the urology department of Southmead
Hospital Bristol with the bleeding from my bladder that i have previously mentioned.

Further to my last Blog, I have been in touch with the Amyloidosis Centre, that, as you no doubt

afternoon i was contacted by the Urology dept of the hospital that i attend and i am pleased to
