Geography

Fort Lee is located at 40°51′12.32″N 73°58′29.32″Wï»¿ /
ï»¿40.8534222°N 73.9748111°Wï»¿ / 40.8534222; -73.9748111 (40.853423,
-73.97481). [12] It is north of Edgewater, New Jersey and is on the Hackensack Peninsula
between the Hackensack River and the Hudson River .

According to the United States Census Bureau , the borough has a total area of 2.9 square
miles (7.5 km²), of which, 2.5 square miles (6.6 km²) of it is land and 0.3 square
miles (0.9 km²) of it (12.15%) is water.

History

Fort Lee is named as a result of George Washington and named after General Charles Lee , who
camped in this area, defending New York City . George Washington and his troops actually
walked on a road which is called Main Street in Fort Lee. In fact, it was during Washington's
retreat from Fort Lee in November 1776 that Thomas Paine composed his pamphlet, "The American
Crisis", which began with the recognized phrase, "These are the times that try men's souls". A
statue of Thomas Paine will soon be installed in Monument Park in Fort Lee. The George
Washington Bridge , which connects New Jersey to the Washington Heights neighborhood in
uptown Manhattan , New York City , has its western terminus located in Fort Lee.

In recent years, Fort Lee has seen a surge of residents of Korean origin which has led to the
conversion of much of the town into a large Koreatown , similar to Chinatowns of such cities as
New York and San Francisco in that many traditional Korean stores and restaurants may be seen
in Fort Lee, and the hangul letters of the Korean alphabet are as common as signs in English in
parts of the downtown area.

The rapid increase of the Korean population has seen the decline of many other immigrant
communities once centered in Fort Lee, notably the Greek and Italian communities, once quite
large but now all but extinct. Luxury high-rises built near the George Washington Bridge have
attracted many New York City residents to the city as well, as Fort Lee offers some relief from
the stresses and prices of living in New York City. A sizable Russian immigrant community has
also sprung up in recent years, also attracted by the urban setting of Fort Lee.

America's First Motion Picture Industry

The history of cinema in the United States can trace its roots to the East Coast where at one
time, Fort Lee was the motion picture capital of America. The industry got its start at the end
of the 19th century with the construction of Thomas Edison 's "Black Maria", the first motion
picture studio in West Orange, New Jersey . Cities in New Jersey offered land at costs
considerably less than New York City , and the cities and towns of New Jersey near New York
benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the
20th century.

Filmmaking began attracting both capital and an innovative workforce and when the Kalem
Company began using Fort Lee in 1907 as a location for filming in the area, other filmmakers
quickly followed. In 1909, a forerunner of Universal Studios , the Champion Film Company ,
built the first studio. They were quickly followed by others who either built new studios or
who leased facilities in Fort Lee. In the 1910s and 1920s, film companies such as the
Independent Moving Pictures Company , Peerless Studios , The Solax Company , Éclair Studios
, Goldwyn Picture Corporation , American Méliès (Star Films), World Pictures , Biograph
Studios , Fox Film Corporation , Pathé Frères , Metro Pictures Corporation , Victor Film
Company , Selznick Pictures Corporation were all making pictures in Fort Lee. Such notables
as Mary Pickford and Miles Remy got their start at Biograph Studios.

With the offshoot businesses that sprang up to service the film studios, for nearly two
decades Fort Lee experienced unrivaled prosperity. However, just as the development of Fort
Lee production facilities was gaining strength, Nestor Studios of Bayonne, New Jersey ,
built the first studio in Hollywood in 1911. Nestor Studios owned by David and William
Horsley, later merged with Universal Studios, and William Horsley's other company
Hollywood Film Laboratory is now the oldest existing company in Hollywood, now called the
Hollywood Digital Laboratory. California 's more hospitable and cost effective climate led
to the eventual shift of virtually all filmmaking to the West Coast by the 1930s. Some
companies, such as American Méliès, moved to San Antonio, Texas , and others moved to
Jacksonville, Florida .

Since 2000 the Fort Lee film commission has been charged with celebrating the history of film
in Fort Lee as well as to attract film and television production companies to the borough.
