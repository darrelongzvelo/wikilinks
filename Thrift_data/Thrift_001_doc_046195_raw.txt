Weekend Update, Some Numbers & Personal Tank Progress..as Well as a Welcome to New Readers

Filed under: Aquaponics Project — Leave a comment July 21, 2012

I’d like to start by welcoming my slew of new readers, all 300 of you! I’d thank you each
personally – but I’m a very busy hippie trying to save the planet, LOL

Image: http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g

For those of you just reading about my FoodStream take a look back to where it all started…
first AP post was here . My blog goes a little further back than that, and was a hodge podge of news
and info about tanks, my cooking, my business (personal chef in the Seattle area, I travel WA
state and teach people how to cook) but this first post was when I started really feeding my
passion for plants and looking for a better way to source local food, without buying it.

You’ll see a lot of great things about AP in these posts, and I believe it is the best way to do
things…right now…technology is alwaysÂ evolvingÂ and we are finding better ways
to do things. I like AP because it is using low tech ways + the knowledge we’ve gained from
science to try and do things the way mother nature does. Welcome once again and please do some
back reading to see where this all started for me, and where it can go for you.

If you are in the Seattle area and interested in your own home system, feel free to contact me –
I’m happy to help.

Every week for the next 6 weeks (around Tue) I will post about the progress of the project I’m
working on with the kids at Seattle Parks & Rec Garfield Teen Life Center – yesterday I went in
to start the second tank for the kids and I added life to the water – in the form of tank gunk

Image: http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g
Just like where we all came from, I tossed in some of the muck from my tank. Someone even jokingly
asked why did I make the water dirty, LOL. I explained I was starting life

Image: http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g
When I return on Tues the kids will finish constructing the plumbing for both tanks, add
heaters and air pumps, start learning to take & read water chemistry (ammonia, pH, nitrites &
nitrates) and will inoculate the tanks a second time – they are going to think it’s gross

Image: http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g

On a personal note – my tanks at home are kicking ass! The front “house plant tank”
continues grow some large sized plants, and actually needs some denser planting to bring down
the nitrates. That will happen in a few weeks when i have to dismantle and move the tank. The move
will also prove what kind ofÂ resilience my system has at this point. pH = 6.6, nitrites = 0,
nitrates = 40 ppm, ammonia = 0.

The tank in my room – which I currently have chives, tomatoes, basil & globe basil growing in
is in heaven. pH = 7.2, nitrites = 0, nitrates = 0, ammonia = 0. Remember “0″ in these tests
meansÂ undetectable, and the eco system is running strong. The tomatoes are the real
nitrate suckers in this system and I can’t wait until I see what color fruit they produce, it
was surprise seeds from a friend!

More midweek updates about my system, and videos to come, once I get some things to harvest and
build my new filter boxes, I’m going to make some major changes this fall and winter to
increase production the upcoming summers. To all my new readers out there, I’m hoping some
of you may be in the APÂ communityÂ - and close to Seattle – to help out. I’d like to
continue to run outreach programs and classes (hopefully in a greenhouse) to teach people
about thisÂ valuableÂ tool we have at our finger tips. If you have ideas & resources,
please feel free to contact me through comments and email, bbrunches@gmail.com, I’d love
to hear from you!

Basil & Heirloom Tomatoes Planted and Growing…More to Come

Filed under: Aquaponics Project — 1 Comment May 7, 2012

Globe basil! I got this awesome little herb from a client! It grows in a “globe” shape, has
an awesome aroma, and is just like basil but a little spicier. You just cut it off and sprinkle it
on or mix it in. This was a cutting from their plant that I rooted in my systems’ water. There is
one growing in the tower and one in the other tank.

Here we have regular basil started from seed. It took about 5 days to germinate! I love not only
how quickly things happen in aquaponics, but also how quick you can see it happening! My past
basil growing has always ended with the stalks dying from over harvesting. I’ve planted a
bunch thisÂ  in hopes of preventingÂ 

Image: http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g
I’m hoping to see some real leaves in the next couple days.

These two shots are of the heirloom tomato starts. I have 5 vines started this year. Last year
two was a lot – but I have a feeling these will be determinant vines…in other words they
won’t grow 17 ft

Image: http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g
Hopefully a max of 6 feet with lots of fruit. We will also see if all the vines make it, one got
planted oddly and might not survive.

As you can tell the grow tower has been set back up for theÂ  in my bedroom. I will be building a
new grow box in June and filling it with a few new vegetables. I’ve got snow peas, round
carrots, chives, red peppers, ancho chiles and scottish leeks. Depending on room…maybe
some beets, rhubarb and chard. I’m also trying to construct a drip tower made of cut,
recycled bottles. This will become a hanging herb garden of parsely,Â  sage,
rosemary….and yes, maybe thyme, lol. Bad culinary joke.

I will, of course, be updating with pictures and some new videos since we have some good things
happening now.

Some Deaths in the Tank…and a Few Tailess Guppies

Filed under: Aquaponics Project — Leave a comment October 16, 2011

State of the tank about a month after the removal of my tomato vine is, well, a little funny.

Looks wise…my room has never looked so empty…or bright, LOL. Â The vine had grown so
much that is was blocking out a lot of light and my room always had this nice, dim, greenish tint
to it. Â Now the pocket tower is completely void of plants and the worms are slowly feasting
and un-cloggingÂ the leftover roots. The windows are WIDE open – it feels so barren!

pH still requires the addition of lime every week or two to keep it around 6.6. Â As happens in
most mature AP systems, the pH tends to drop to 6 as time goes on, so I am calling this healthy.

Nitrates are SLOWLY rising in the tank. Â They were staying at 0 (or at least undetectable)
while the tomatoes were flourishing, but now there are only the houseplant filters to keep
them at bay – though the houseplants have remained healthy & growing. Â Not to mention the
lack of summer sun here in the PNW. Â I do have a grow bulb above everything, but it is not
nearly enough to sustain the type of growth I saw this summer.

Ammonia levels remain undetectable – combined with the rising levels of nitrates, that
makes me happy. Â My system is still stable and running.

I haven’t been home much the past month, and had decided to lower the feeding schedule in my
tank as well. I was wary of the potential to raise the ammonia & nitrate levels with less plant
load. Â This did not go over as well as I would have hoped, in terms of fish happiness. Â I
was not paying too much attention to the tank, as I’ve been in & out a lot with work.
Â Feeding just once a day, much as I did this past fall & winter. Â I was getting in my tank a
few days ago to clean the glass, fill the tank, and raise the pH a little and noticed something.
Â Two goldfish are missing (of course not Mocha, the pig/bully, lol), one of my loaches had
been attacked and has since died. Â My siameseÂ algaeÂ eater (big guy) was dead and
they had eaten out his stomach, and one of my guppies…though quite healthy and seemingly
happy right now…is missing his ENTIRE tail. Â Urgh.

So the reduction in feeding turned into a turf war of fish gangs, I’m surprised I didn’t
find little bandanas on my fishes’ heads so they could show their colors.

Trying to look on the bright side of things…a reduction in fish load will help to keep levels
down this fall & winter as feeding continues. I’m back to twice a day, but am feeding less per
feeding. I also have plans to remove the tower soon for the cold months and use the existing pump
to build a new houseplant filter to take up the slack. Â I have few improvements on my indoor
design that I would like to try anyway. Â The improvements should make the filter move
mobile & easier to performÂ maintenance on if needed. Pic & videos of the improvements can
be found on this blog once they get going.

I’d also like to give a personal thank you to Tommy of Denmark for his interest in my blog and
using his new-found information to try and start an interest in AP in Denmark! Also to Stephen
from Maine for including me on his tour when he visits Seattle to check out my system! I
encourage the rest of you to reach out to me and each other – AP is not only a cool way to keep
fish, but a great new way to have local, sustainable, earth friendly food at your fingertips.
Let’s build together!

Sarting Your Own Tank – Steps to Perfection

Filed under: Aquaponics Project — 14 Comments September 10, 2011

Been wanting to start your own AP system? This will be the article for you. I will discuss water,
breeding bacteria, fish, plants, lighting…everything you need – and include links to my
favorite sources of information. My favorite site for information is the Aquaponics
Community Forum , they have information, an online shop, and a great community to field
questions. Â You will find many references to their site and store in this post. It’s a
great place to buy things if you can’t locally source them…but check the links when I
mention an item so you know what to look for in your local pond/fish/hardware stores. The first
article you should read is here , these are the general rules of thumb for running an AP
system…remember, GENERAL rules

Image: http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g

    The information in my article will mostly discuss what you need to do for an INDOOR system,
    though many of the principles can be applied to outdoor systems as well. The following
    information is also based off my success with my own tank over the past year:

    - 55 gallon tank filled with about 30 – 35 gallons of water

    

    - 1 lg & 2 small “reverse constant flow” media bed filters and one pocket tower – both
    use hydroton & lava rock

    

    - a mixture of houseplants including dieffenbachia, spathiphyllum, philodendron,
    zygocactus, ficus, creeping fig, ivy, java moss, moss, and a tarantula fern – added to
    the system this spring & summer were a basil plant and a cherry tomato vine (which reached
    close to 17 ft before cutting it)

    

    - redworms added to the system and living in all filters and in the pocket tower

    

    - temp maintained between 76F & 80F

    

    - pH hovering between 6.2 & 6.6

    

    - one air pump running in the bottom of the lg filter…though this died in the beginning of
    the summer with no apparent ill effects

    

    - 3 goldfish, 3 clown loaches, a siamese algae eater, 3 cory catfish, 2 dojo loaches, a
    dozen or so fancy guppies varying in age, pond/red ramshorn/malaysian trumpet snails
    and cherry shrimp

    



AP systems are advertised as being chemical free. Â This is mostly true – but nearly
everything in our lives are chemicals. Â You will see links in this article for products
such as “stress coat” and “pH up”, though these are chemicals – they are nothing
harmful and are only the most basic substances that can be found in nature and are useful to the
system to help the fish and bacteria grow. Although we are trying to recreate mother nature in
our tanks, she has several more advantages to balancing her world naturally than we do.

Tank Size & Placement

The most important first step is determining size.Â  Several factors will come into play
for this decision. Location, weight, lighting,Â  types of fish you want, type of AP system
to use…all these should be considered, but first look at your space.Â  What can you fit
comfortably? The bigger tank, the heavier the system if it has to be moved. Can you easily get
into and around the tank for maintenance? Is there enough space in & around the tank to build out
for growbeds?

You also need to consider weight at this point.Â  Water alone weighs about 8 pounds per
gallon (so a 10 gallon tank with nothing else in it but water will already weigh in at 80 lbs)Â 
Most floors can handle larger tanks (up to 50/55 gallons) without a second thought. What you
need to think about is the stand you are going to put it on.Â  Fish tank stands are built to
withstand the weight, other tables aren’t, so choose well and do your research.

Lighting

Lighting will depend on what you are growing.Â  There are a couple of rules about light & tank
placement before even talking about enough lights for plants.

â€¢ Fish tanks should NOT be placed in direct light.Â  This will cause not only
temperature fluctuations, but temp extremes that can kill both fish & the ecosystem you will
be growing.

â€¢ The bacteria (nitrobacteria) that you need to grow thrive in darkness, UV light will
kill them.Â  Another reason to not have the tank in direct sunlight & to have deeper grow
beds…which we will talk about in more detail later.

Lighting for plants

Indoor vegetable gardens are completely possible without additional lighting. Most of you
already know I grew a bounty of tomatoes in my window, and I’m in the PNW! Consider what you
want to grow…a good number of common houseplants that do well in AP systems (ie: golden
pothos, spathiphyllum, philodendron, ficus) will do quite well in a north or east facing
window if that is all that you have. South & west facing windows will provide more light to
support more plants, but again, the tank itself should not get direct light, just the plants
– and some plants can get “burned” in direct light. A west or south facing window will be
needed to grow most vegetables – a longer photosynthetic period is needed for these plants
to covert enough food & set fruit. Research your plants needs before placement and planting.

Most house plants I’ve used have done quite well with lighting from a “plant”
typeÂ fluorescentÂ bulb.

Tools/Equipment Needed

    You will need the following tools & equipment handy for most tanks:

    1 - Tank – all glass aquariums with silicone seal (its non reactive with the ecosystem)
    are great. Â Getting a used one to help recycle is awesome – just be sure it was only
    used for fish & is cleaned well with a weak bleach solution, then RINSED very well.

    

    2 - Filter or growbed – please see “filter & growbed” section below

    

    3 - Pump – you need a quality pump that will move as many gallons as your tank holds per hour
    (ie: 55 gallons of water should be moved per hour for a 55 gallon tank) You also need to
    consider the power the pump has to “lift” water, check the pump package for numbers. I
    used ecopumps, they are cheaper and run well

    

    4 - Growth substrate – any type of gravel that doesn’t have limestone or marble in it
    (it can leach out and change pH) I personally use lava rock & hydroton (a type of expanded
    clay marble) Another great new choice is expanded shale . Click here for more info and
    pricing on all these. Â A word on lava rock, it works great and is cheap ($4 for 25 lbs at
    Home Depot) but requires a lot of rinsing and is hard on hands and roots if moving plants
    around.

    

    5 - Flexible tubing – Any type of flexible tubing available in pet or pond stores is
    suitable for your tank. Â Most smaller pumps will use a 1/2 inch plastic tubing, black
    is better than clear.

    

    6 - Air Pump – It will benefit most tanks to have an air pump going, detailed reasons will
    be discussed further in the article.

    

    7 - Testing kit – don’t skimp on this one. Â You can find test strips…but they
    OFTEN give false readings. Â Save up and buy a Freshwater Test Kit for your system.
    Â It can help you decipher what is happening in your tank.

    



These are the basics you need to get started for any system. Â The rest of this article will
discuss in further detail what you need to run your system.

Air pump

Why? All AP systems are dependent on O2, moreÂ precisely, dissolved O2. Â The only way to
get O2 dissolved in the water is to move the water around, a lot. Â It also helps the O2 gas
exchange when a large surface area of water is exposed to the air. Â Also, cooler water holds
more O2 than warmer water.

A well placed air pump + air stone doesn’t work by dissolving O2 into the water from the tiny
bubbles it produces, but rather helps to move the water continually up to the surface and
creates a flow + enlarged surface area by breaking the surface tension. Â This system is a
great Â O2 back up as well if the water pump goes down for a while.

Filter & Growbed

There are many ways to build a grow bed for your system. Â Most systems use either an “ebb &
flow” or “constant flow” in media beds, or “NFT/DWC” (nutrient film
technique/deep water culture) system. Quick explanations of each of these here . Please
check the forums here or google for more information on these terms, be sure to include the word
aquaponics when googling.

    I want to talk about my filters. Â I am using a sort of “reverse constant flow” for
    all my tanks. Â The design is simple and has several advantages:

    - It is more compact that traditional AP growbeds

    

    - Because these filters sit IN the tank, there is little chance of leaks that can drain your
    tank/kill your fish/ruin your apartment or home

    

    - Based on my year of experimentation this system seems to be just as effective as the two
    traditional methods

    

    - Due to their smaller size, these systems are more removable/transportable/cleanable
    should the need arise

    



    These systems, as do all, also have some disadvantages:

    - Small size means smaller grow bed area = less room to grow more plants

    

    - Because these filters reside in the tank, they take up space in your tank that could be
    used for fish or additional water for added system stability (read more about this in
    “water” section)

    

    - smaller tank size indoors means it is harder to grow fish for food

    



Filter design

The construction is rather simple. I like to use the biggest & thickest glass (it is inert)
vases I can find. Â In the bottom of the vase run a tube, which will attach to the pump in the
tank, coming up and over the top. Â Making the tube/connection to the pump easily
detachable makes it much easier to doÂ maintenance when/if needed. You can also add an
airstone with tubing attached to it to go to the air pump. Â Remember to make a removable
connection where it comes out of the vase so it can be disassembled if needed.

The next step is to fill the vase with your pre-washed grow media. I plan on building future
filters by first finding a net pot Â or similar basket large enough to fit inside my vase,
then filling the net pot with grow media. Â This will allow you to easily lift the pot out in
the event you need to replace the tubing, the vase, the airstone or work on your plants.

Plants can now be planted in the media bed to filter the water for your fish. Â Once the pump is
turned on, water & fish waste will be pumped to the bottom of the filter and travel up.
Â Solids will slowly collect in the media and on the roots as it is broken down by
nitrobacteria and made into food for the plants. As the water travels to the top, it spills out
and back into the tank – filtered of toxins called nitrites & nitrates and renewing its
dissolved O2.

I do not have any scientific evidence to back up the benefit of the airpump, but I took a hint from
NFT/DWC systems who place air pumps in the bottom of the water trough that plant roots sit in.
Â The air bubbles collect on the roots, helping to provide additional O2 when solids start
to build up on them. Â I found my filters seemed healthier during the first 8 months or so of
maturing time. Â My pump has since stopped working, but I have seen no decline, possibly due
to the maturity of the system.

Water, Chemistry & the Nitrogen Cycle

Water is the life of your system. Â It carries O2 to fish for breathing, to bacteria so they
can breakdown compounds, and to plants in the evening so they can finish the photosynthesis
cycle. Â Water also dissolves minerals to help regulate pH & it keeps temperature from
fluctuating too rapidly.

The more water you can have in the system, the more stable it will be (this is called its
buffering capacity) – although I can state with absolute certainty that you can have
aÂ successful AP system with just 2.5 gallons of water. Â The dangers you are more likely
to face with smaller systems are swinging pH, temperature, and low dissolved O2.

Water is also the home of your bacteria. Â More specifically your Nitrosomonas and
Nitrobacter bacteria. These bacteria complete the nitrogen cycle that must thrive in your
tank in order for AP to be successful.

The nitrogen cycle works like this: Organic compounds (fish waste, left over fish food,
rotting plant bits, dead animals) break down into ammonia. Â Nitrosomonas & Nitrobacter
are found in small numbers all over your tank, but theÂ Nitrosomonas bacteria begin to
flourish when ammonia levels rise. Â They feed on ammonia and convert it into nitrites.
Â Nitrobacter then begin to flourish as they convert the nitrites into nitrates. Â As
the dissolved nitrates are pumped into your grow beds, the plant roots absorb them and use them
as food. Â The ammonia, nitrites & nitrates have now all been filtered out of the water by
your bacteria/plants, and as long as you have good flow the O2 is replaced and is now a healthy
environment for your fish. Your fish create waste and the cycle begins again.

    Criteria for your bacteria to flourish:

    - A temperature between 60F & 86F, anything on the extremes and they will begin to die

    

    - The bacteria like the dark places of your tank – UV light kills them (corners, under
    gravel, and deep in growbeds)

    

    - There must be porous surfaces for them to grow on (your bed media)…they can not thrive
    in the water column

    

    - Presence of ammonia to start the cycle

    

    - a pH between 6 & 8

    



Where Â you want your temperature & pH lie will depend on what kind of fish and plants you want
to grow. Â Do some research to see who matches best with what. Also remember to get a test kit
so you can track changes in the nitrite, nitrate, ammonia & pH levels…these levels tell you
many things about what is happening in your system and what you need to do to adjust them.

Chlorine & Chloramines

Cities use either chlorine or chloramine to treat our water. Â Both chemicals are bad for
your fish and for your bacteria – they will cause death. Be sure to check your local city water
treatment plant (details usually available online) to see what they use. Â If it is
chlorine, you can let water sit out for 48 hours and the chlorine will dissipate and be safe to
add. Â Chloramine does not dissipate and remains dangerous without treatment.

There are water conditioners Â to treat chlorine (NOT chloramine) you can add to a home
system that don’t pose a threat…though try to only use them in a pinch if there is no time to
degas the chlorine if you plan on eating veggies from the system. Â There is no hard evidence
of it effecting humans or getting into the veggies…but better to err on the side of caution.
For a houseplant only tank, it is fine to use every time you add water.

I am not an expert on getting rid of chloramines as I don’t have them in my water supply.
Â Take a look at this forum threadÂ  for some ideas and some other links to read on the
subject.

Cycling your tank – making a happy home for fish & bacteria

There are two ways to cycle your tank, which means getting the nitrogen cycle started.
Â With fish and without.

Cycling your tank with fish involves having the whole system set up and adding fish. Â You
feed them just a bit each day. Â Their waste creates ammonia, which starts the cycle.
Â This, however, can be quite stressful on fish as the presence of ammonia & nitrites are
harmful to fish – they could become sick or die. Â Some species of fish really don’t seem
to care, but it is still a risk.

You can also cycle without fish. Â I started by planting some plants in the system and
letting it run. Â The decaying roots on the plants caused the ammonia spike for me. Â You
can see a white, milky clouding and slight thickening of the water when this happens. Â This
starts to clear as the first batch of bacteria grow and as the ammonia spike lowers it cause a
nitrite spike. Â The second batch of bacteria then start to bloom and there is a lowering of
nitrites and an increase in nitrates – then the plants can start to feed and grow.
Â Nitrates are not nearly as dangerous to fish, unless there is long-term exposure, so this
is a good place to start adding fish. Again, this is why testing is important to see where your
cycle is at and when it is safe to add fish.

Always add fish and increase feeding SLOWLY. The resulting rise in waste can cause another
ammonia spike, and your system, especially when new, needs time to catch up.

Other people start by adding pure ammonia (without any surfactants in them) instead of
waiting for organic material to start to rot. Â Check out this forum topic Â and read up on
different styles and products people use to get the job done, then decide what you are
comfortable with what works for you.

Water Pump & Flow

As mentioned before, water flow & agitation of the surface means increased O2 levels and
complete support for the life of your system. Â Look at water pumps that will move the entire
volume of water in your tank every hour. Â You also need to look at the back of the box on the
pump to see how high it can lift water. Â For example, my pocket tower is 3 ft high and is on a 6
inch riser in my tank. Â The pump I bought for it needs to easily lift water 4 ft and be able to
move at least 35 gallons of water per hour. Â It is easy to take a moment and check, and worth
avoiding the frustration.

Using Redworms

Take a look at this article I wrote awhile ago about vermiponics, adding redworms to your
system, for the advantages of trying it, plus some rules for adding them. A note on timing,
don’t add them too early to a system. Â The worms need to eat. Â They eat fish poo,
bacteria & decaying plant matter. Â In a new system (which I might classify as under 9
months) there may not be enough food to keep the worms alive.

The worms also make a nice way to compost veggie matter. Â During the growing season of my
tomato vine I would chop up any leaves or stems that I pruned and put it in the top of my pocket
tower. Â Within a couple of days the worms would have devoured everything.

Fish

What fish to use?

It is a personal choice. The great thing about AP systems is being able to grow edible plants AND
fish. Â The downfall of indoor AP systems is you are usually limited to veggies as growing a
bunch of edible fish means you need a lot of room to grow them. Â I would stick to ornamental
fish when staying inside. Â Goldfish are a great, cheap choice for making a dirty tank
(remember you NEED waste to keep the system going) and don’t need a heater in a home that stays
a fairly constant temp. Â They are, however, fairlyÂ aggressiveÂ if there are
smaller fish (they eat baby guppies) and will most likely destroy any plants planted directly
in the gravel bed unless they are big and established.

Also think about the max size of the fish when full-grown – this will help dictate what you can
use.

Plants

Remember you can use just houseplants in your system if you would like to just have pet fish in a
tank that uses few chemicals, is cheaper to start & maintain, and will be a beautiful addition
to your home. Â The plants I have beenÂ successfulÂ with are dieffenbachia ,
spathiphyllum , philodendron , zygocactus , ficus , creeping fig , ivy , java moss , moss , and
tarantula fern . I’ve included links so you can see what they look like and get some detailed
info on them. You canÂ experiment with others and see what does well for you. Â This
winter I am attempting to use several different species of stonecrop plants, cacti &
succulents.

Almost any veggie can be grown depending on light & room. Â I had wonderful luck with
tomatoes, lettuce & basil in my pocket tower – next year will be heirloom tomatoes,
cucumbers, peppers & herbs. Most grow fine together, some have special needs. Â Leafy
greens are the easiest, veggies and fruit require a little more attention to the tank, and
require a more mature tank. (see “tank maturity” below) There are even people growing
citrus trees, LOL, which I don’t have room for. Â Check out this forum link Â and google
some AP veggie topics before planting.

Tank maturity &Â  maintenance

A new system will have very little food to offer your plants. Â As a tank matures, the cycle of
ammonia -> nitrites -> nitrates happens veryÂ efficiently and can support the needs of
hungry plants, ie: vegetables. I didn’t consider my tank mature until it was about 9 months
old. Â The readings seemed to stay stable, the water took on an amber tint (all AP systems do
this as they age) and everything was absolutely BOOMING in growth. Â Leaf size on some
plants were HUGE.

Watch your tank, learn your fish & plant behavior. Â You will notice when things seem to be
working better. (this is also Â a good time to add a boost with the worms) You can plant
veggies before the tank is mature – in fact, you have to plant SOMETHING for the system to
work, though you may not get immediate, big results. Â Try using houseplants first, then
replacing them with or adding in veggies once mature.

You will also notice that as time goes on, your even level of pH will start to slowly drop toward
6. Â This is a natural effect of a good AP system. (from what I understand, decaying matter
naturally causes a drop in pH, though I don’t know why) This is an easy fix with a product
called pH up . Â It contains potassium hydroxide & potassium carbonate – all safe &
beneficial for fish and plants. These substances would normally be replaced in the wild by
slowly leaching from rock…so we occasionally need to provide them to our tanks.

Maintenance

There is lessÂ maintenanceÂ than a traditional fish tank. Though people usually
become so entranced with their systems it doesn’t matter and they always have their hands in
it. Â There are NO monthly water changes or vacuuming needed! It will actually hurt your
tank to do so. Â The fish waste is USED by the system to maintain balance. Â The only time
you add water is when it evaporates. Â If you seem to have an ammonia spike in your tank – you
don’t need to change water or add a neutralizer, you simply need to reduce feeding to your
fish. Â The less waste they produce and less leftover food in the tank means less ammonia
being produced. Â With an ammonia spike also comes a spike in bacteria growth, which only
strengthens your system.

Learn to take readings of and understand what the levels of ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, & pH
mean and how they interact with one another and you can easily change the conditions of your
tank by knowing when to wait changes out and when to act.

As a tank matures, you may have to wipe some algae growth from the glass – which can also be an
indicator of too high a fish ratio to plants if it’s out of control. You may also have to
occasionally rinse out any pre filter sponges you have IF they clog. Â Remember not to use
untreated tap water as a colony of bacteria will live in the sponges and chlorine will kill
them. Â The dirty water from rinsing them is great to use on houseplants.

Other than that & maybe some occasional pruning, the system if fairly self-sustaining.

Final thoughts

Have fun building and maintaining your tank! Use your imagination andÂ experiment with
your own design while using the general rules as a guide. Â Look at your tank everyday to
learn what is normal behavior for your fish and plants so you can recognize problems if they
arise later on. Â Â Remember to always look things up if you don’t know and reach out to
forums full of people doing the same thing you are. Â Someone has probably had your same
problem before with a fix for it.

If you have questions or comments, I’d love to hear them! Live in the seattle area and want to
start one, but need personal help? Contact me & we can talk details.

Aquaponics Update #29 – I have Tomatoes!

Filed under: Aquaponics Project — Leave a comment June 5, 2011

After waiting for my blossoms to stop dropping – which for the most part they have – I found
tomatoes!

So far there are just a few tomatoes, but they are growing rapidly and looking healthy! The
entire plant is a good 5 feet high, and there are many flowers on it, so I’m looking forward to a
large crop as the heat and sun continue to rise. Â You can see pics of the tomatoes
below…and a fun shot I took of one of the lettuce seeds that sprouted inside of one of the
hydroton balls. WP_SLIDESHOW_IMAGES = { load:

Aquaponics Update #28 – Tracking Lettuce Growth & Worm Health over Five Days

Day 5

In just 5 days my lettuce has made leaps and bound in growth. Every morning I wake up it’s
bigger than the last day. Â These plants are supposed to be great nitrogen scrubbers for an
aquaponics systems. Â My nitrates are a bit higher than I want them since adding the new fish
& since the ammonia spike has leveled out, so these guys should really do the trick until the
other plants get bigger. Â I am hoping to harvest some lettuce from them, but I may skip
thinning out the sprouts and see how dense they can grow without blocking the flow of the tower.

Any that do die off should become food for my newest residents, the red worms. Â The worms are
seem to be quite happy in the tank. Â I have them in all levels of the tower, and have been
saving tomato plant cuttings to feed to the top tier (there are no plants there, it’s where
the water is pumped in, but until fish solids build up there for food, I have to feed the worms) I
also have them in the main filter where they seem very happy coming out from where ever they hide
during the day to engulf my ficus trunk and eat away the fungus andÂ debris.

There were two groups of redworms that literally climbed up the tank/plants into the corner
– these guys were in the two smaller filters. Â I figured that meant it wasn’t a happy
home, so I moved them into the tower. Â Haven’t noticed any rouge worms since.

Aquaponics Update (Mini) #27 – Less than 24 hours Later, Seeds Sprouted!

Filed under: Aquaponics Project — Leave a comment May 23, 2011

http://bbrunches.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/lettuceseed2.jpg?w=612&h=1024

White specs on the brownish - grey seeds are new roots

Less than 24 hours after planting, my lettuce seeds have sprouted roots! Â Look in the white
circles in these pictures and you can see them. Â This is a red leafed romaine lettuce, so
here’s hoping is saves a little room by growing up instead of a big ball, lol.



Image:
http://bbrunches.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/lettuceseed1.jpg?w=612&h=1024 The
great part is it means I won’t have the issues I did last time trying to sprout seeds like I
mentioned in my last post . Â It’s a mini up – date because that’s all I have to
report…but I will leave you with a fun fact about lettuce I found on Wikipedia,
“Â LactucariumÂ (or â€œLettuce Opiumâ€�) is a mildÂ opiate-like
substance that is contained in all types of lettuce. Both the Romans and Egyptians took
advantage of this property by eating lettuce at the end of a meal to induce sleep.”

Aquaponics Update #26 – Lettuce & Worms added, Vermiponics!

Filed under: Aquaponics Project — 4 Comments May 23, 2011

Image: http://bbrunches.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/imag0854.jpg?w=179&h=300

200 redworms

Verminponics – loosely defined (and I don’t know by who) by the addition of red worms to an
existing aquaponic system. Â Why add worms? Isn’t the fish waste already broken down by
beneficial bacteria? Yes it is, but worms help to take it one step further.

A worm consumes dead organic matter – dead leaves, rotting veggies, fish poo. Â Although
the bacteria do the same job, worms can do it a little quicker and get to the things the bacteria
haven’t yet. Â Worm castings (worm poo) are immediately available fertilizer for the
plants. Â They don’t cloud water, don’t harm fish, and release fertilizer
slowly…so you don’t burn out your plants. Â Castings containÂ nitrogen, calcium,
magnesium, phosphates & potash. Â So they help give an aquaponics system balanced
nutrition. Â Worms also help to spread & increase the amount of beneficial bacteria. There
is also a theory (though I haven’t seen anything confirming) that the gut of a worm is able to
chemically alter iron into chelated iron – which is the form plants need it in to take it up.

Let’s get one thing out of the way – yes, worms can survive underwater as long as there is
sufficient dissolved O2. Â Worms absorb O2 through their skin, not with lungs. Â They
can stay under for a LONG time while feeding…some worms have even been found living in the
threads of pumps. Â Lots of flowing water and food there! There are also lots of places to
hide out of the water if they need to escape.

To provide a good home for my worms I need lots of water circulation and not too warm (hot water
holds less dissolved O2 than cold) Is there enough O2 in my tank? I believe so – especially in
the tower because of the high churning of the water cascading down and the large surface area
exposed to the air. Â Not to mention there are plenty of actual air pockets in the tower.
Â Another benefit f the worms in the tower is they will act as a clean up crew for dead roots and
help prevent any blockages in the tower’s water flow.

Worms being added to the main filter

I’ve also added worms to each of my houseplants filters, they have visible solids in them
that I can’t really clean out. Â The bacteria are breaking them down (you can see them
softening over time) but I’m hoping the worms will give them a boost.

I got to see some of the root development of my starts as well. Â The picture to the right

Image: http://bbrunches.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/imag0851.jpg?w=300&h=179

Broccoli start

is my broccoli start. Â I moved the tomato start that was with it up with the other one
(that’s the beauty of aquaponics in hydroton -REALLY easy to move plants around) The roots
on this were about a third of the size when I planted them on the 9th of May, less than two weeks
ago. Everything is growing really well right now, and I’ve decided to take advantage of the
PNW’s cool spring start.



Image: http://bbrunches.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/imag0859.jpg?w=179&h=300

Lettuces love cool weather and are also really good nitrogen scrubbers for a tank – I have a
great supply of nutrients, so I figured I might as well use them. Â This just a red leaf
romaine lettuce. Â I decided to go with seeds to see how they fare in my system. Â I tried
some plant seeds during the winter which failed to germinate – but I believe the cause to be
insufficient warmth & nutrients. Â My tank is very mature right now, tons of light, and the
heater is good.

There are two videos below ofÂ the worms going in the tower and also in to my main filter.
Don’t forget to subscribe to my videos so you are alerted for future updates.

Aquaponics Update #25 – Root Growth in Tower, Blossom Drop & New Fish

Filed under: Aquaponics Project — Leave a comment May 19, 2011

In my last post Â I talked about the tower being planted…finally, lol. Â The tomato
plant has grown at least 8 inches since then. Â It has been really amazing.

Image: http://bbrunches.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/imag0830.jpg?w=179&h=300

Tomato roots on right hand side

In this photo you can see the tomato roots growing down the tower (this is in the pocket the basil
is planted in, which is below the tomatoes) The growth of the roots plus the additional foliage
and flowers is very promising. it means the plant is taking in nutrients and the roots are
getting enough O2, even with a continuous flooding of water.

In the large photo below you can see the roots of the basil plant growing down toward the last
pocket – currently planted with a schefflerra cutting I’m trying to root.

Basil roots coming down to the last pocket of the tower



Image: http://bbrunches.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/imag0833.jpg?w=179&h=300 The
growth on the basil plant is doing very well also. Â Awesome scent in my room…and looking
healthy. Â I want to keep this plant bushy instead of tall – limited room in an apartment
setting….

Image: http://bbrunches.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/imag0837.jpg?w=179&h=300

First Basil Harvest

Which means I got my first harvest of basil today! Small, but the first of many this season.
Â I was hoping to see some fruiting of the tomato plants as well…but that turns out to be a
different story

Image: http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif?m=1129645325g

Although the tomato plants are growing very healthy…and producing many flowers…the
blossoms keep dropping after having bloomed for a couple days. Â After some research on
tomato growing, I think the culprit may be temperature. Â It is getting sunny here in the PNW
– but our first 67 degree day was yesterday. Â It has only been mid 5o’s up until
now…and that’s during the day, at night it has been mid 40′s. Â I am growing
inside…but my room stays cooler than the rest of the apartment, and I have my window open a
lot.

So until the night time temps creep up into the 60′s – I think I may continue to see great
growth, but few tomatoes. Â In the meantime, the starts of tomatoes and broccoli (I think
it’s broccoli) are growing very well – I’ll keepÂ monitoringÂ their progress.
and I’m thinking of planting another herb that tolerates wet very well – the last pocket of
the tower is part way in the tank water level.

I’m also happy to report my biofilter seems to be quite healthy and adaptable. Â I have
recently had to add 6 new fish. Â I was only going to add a few small ones…but due
toÂ unforeseenÂ circumstances I had to add 3 grown clown loaches, a 6 inch siamese algae
eater, a zebra tetra and an albino cory catfish. Â I was worried about the large addition of
fish to the system and how my tank would react. Â Ammonia levels did increase, as expected,
but with the constant warm temp & already healthy colony of bacteria, they are already coming
back down on their own – and all the fish have settled in and seem very happy. Â The upside of
the small ammonia spike is it means more nutrients being processed for use by the plants.

This pic is of the top of just one of the current plant filters. Â This filter started with
maybe 10 leaves. Â Every leaf since then has been big, green, and growing fast…it’s
hard to see, but there are three new shoots coming up at the moment.

Aquaponics Update #24 – Vertical Tower has been Planted!

Filed under: Aquaponics Project — Leave a comment May 10, 2011

I have been WAITING for sunshine plus delivery of my vertical tower to plant things in.

After a little rearranging in the tank of the existing filters (which need to stay running to
filter the water until the tower starts maturing), Â silicon – ing a few joints and
securing the tower to the tank – it was up and running.

I got a tomato plant – cherry tomato plant actually – from Â a friend of mine that also had
some broccoli starts in it plus basil from another friend of mine. Â Those both got planted
today and you can see in the pics and video below how the system looks and works.

There is a third pump added to the tank (and I’ve added some more water – and will most likely
fill with another 10 gallons or so over the next couple days) to run the tower. Â Water is
pumped to the top and drains down, using gravity, over the hydroton & plant roots. Â The
plants might be OK with the pump running all the time – but I’ve gotten some advice about
running it on a timer and off at night. Â The only thing I’m worried about is wear & tear on
the pump since it’s designed to run 24/7 – I still have to think about it.

If things go as planned, I may have tomatoes in about 5 weeks!
