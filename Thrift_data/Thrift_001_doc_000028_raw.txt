Tip 1 : Draw the Line Between Design and Implementation

By Avirat

Now let’s get into dip of every point that we discussed in my earlier post. Many designers say
theyâ€™re the most effective when they spend most of their time on design, not
implementation.Â  But your clients want working sites, not descriptions of them, and
thereâ€™s a lot of technology involved in translating your design into a working,
modern web site . Depending on your skills,Â  interests, and experience, you may choose to
design in Photoshop or Fireworks and leave the HTML and CSS to others. Or you may choose to do
your own coding.

Line Between Design and Implementation

Graphic designers typically donâ€™t get involved in HTML and CSS coding. Front-end
developers code designs in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript . The term â€œweb designerâ€�
means differentÂ Â  things to different people, but typically it implies taking on both
the graphic designer role and at least part of the front-end developer role.

Wherever you choose to draw the line, youÂ  probably want someone else to deal with managing
servers, installing content management systems, and customizing back-end code. If you use a
designer-oriented CMS, especially one that is provided as a hosted service, you may be able to
handle the back-end setup and maintenance without delegating these tasks

to someone else.

Choosing where to draw the line

By making a conscious choice about where you draw the line between design and implementation,
you can more effectively find partners to handle the tasks you choose to outsource.

Itâ€™s rare today for a high-quality web site to be designed, built, and deployed by one
person. The full process requires a range of skills that stretch any one person unreasonably
far. Web projects often become a source of frustration to everyone involved when one or two
people stretch to do jobs for which they donâ€™t really have the experience.

To make the most of your design abilities, itâ€™s important to understand web
technology to a certain level. You donâ€™t need to know how to implement everything
yourself, but you mustÂ  understand the vocabulary of the web and the design elements at
your disposal.

    Thereâ€™s a range of reasonable places where you can divide your site-building
    projects between what you do and what you outsource to others. At the two extremes are:

    - A graphic designer who works in Photoshop (or Fireworks, or even pencil) to create web
    page mock-ups. He or she then hands these off to someone else who builds the site.

    

    - A designer/developer who may start in Photoshop or go straight to HTML and CSS, which he
    or she gradually refines until the site is complete.

    



Each approach has its strengths and its weaknesses. The best approach for you depends on your
interests and aptitudes, your partners, and the kinds of sites you expect to build.

Advantages of the Designer/Coder Split

Graphic design and programming are very different skills, and relatively few people have a
natural talent for both of them. Design is mostly a right-brain, creative activity, while
programming is mostly a left-brain, analytical task.

This divergence of skills and aptitudes supports the approach of dividing the work between a
designer and a coder. For manyÂ  designers with art school backgrounds, dealing with code
in any form is just not what they want to do, but they have the skills to design beautiful web
sites.

By handing off Photoshop or Fireworks comps to a coder, a visual designer can do what they do
best and let someone else turn that design into code.

Complete separation of tasks works best on large projects that can afford to have a group of
specialists and someone to coordinate them. The larger the team (and the budget), the

more appealing specialization becomes.

Advantages of the Jack-of-all-Trades

    If one person can create a great visual design and implement it in reliable,
    easy-to-maintain code, they have many advantages over a team that has split up the design
    and coding tasks:

    - Efficiency . When the designer and coder are the same person, they donâ€™t need to
    spend time meeting with each other, less documentation is needed, and the chances for a
    misunderstanding are minimized.

    

    - Emergent design. The site can start out with a wire-frame-level design but with the
    content and HTML markup all in place. The visual design can then be iteratively improved,
    while using the site with real content and full interactivity.

    

    - Matching of design and technology. The more you know about the technology
    thatâ€™s being used to implement your design, the more likely you are to make
    effective use of it.

    



The big disadvantage of this approach is that it requires you to have a broad range of skills.
Most great designers arenâ€™t very good at programming, and most people who love to

program arenâ€™t great visual designers. So the reality is that, in most cases, to build
sophisticated sites youâ€™re going to want to hand off the implementation details to
someone else at some point.

Making Your Design Business More Competitive

If you draw the line between what you do yourself and what you outsource to others too far
â€œto the rightâ€� (in the diagram presented earlier in this section), you spend a
lot of time working your way up the learning curve and struggling with things that
donâ€™t quite work. This makes your project either very expensive, if you charge the
client for all that time, or

unprofitable, if youâ€™re covering that time on your own or working against a
fixed-price bid.

The further to the left you draw the line, however, the more you are dependent on others.

When you find the sweet spot, your profits go up because youâ€™re not spending time on
things that donâ€™t deliver a lot of value. You can take on larger and more complex jobs
when

dynamic pages, database-driven content, JavaScript widgets, and more are added to your
repertoire, because you have a resource that makes those things easy and inexpensive.

The cost-effectiveness of your implementation partner can have a huge effect on the
profitability of your business. In effect, you are reselling the implementation services,
combined with your design and nurturing.

By combining your design with a good implementation partnerâ€™s services, you create a
more valuable end product and earn higher prices. You can charge a markup on the outside
services, and you add value to your design work.

Managing Outsourcing

When you are outsourcing the implementation of your site, youâ€™re putting someone
else between your design and the end product. This is tremendously empowering, because
someone else is taking care of so many details for you. But it also makes it essential that this
partner be someone you trust and can communicate with easily.

A local freelancer can be the best solution, if you can find someone who meets all your needs. As
wonderful as electronic communication is, it doesnâ€™t quite match a face-to-face
meeting. But by limiting your pool to people who are local, youâ€™re dramatically
limiting the number of possible people. If you give up on having in-person meetings, you
broaden your

area from a 100-mile radius to the entire world.

When you hand over a design for implementation, it is essential that you communicate very
clearly what you expect. You probably have all kinds of ideas in your head about how the site is
going to look and behave, and only some of these ideas show up in your mockups.

    In addition to the visual design itself, your documentation needs to cover:

    - The site map: what are all the pages and page types

    

    - Information architecture: what kinds of information is stored, and how is it organized
    and presented

    

    - Interactive behaviors: anything that doesnâ€™t appear in a mock-up

    



Estimating Costs

Being dependent on others for part of the site-building process requires collaboration when
quoting jobs.

You can work with a contractor on an hourly or a fixed-price basis â€“ a tradeoff you are no
doubt familiar with from your own work. Hourly arrangements give you maximum flexibility,
but less predictability in terms of cost.

Rates vary extremely widely. If you use job sites such as Elance.com, oDesk.com, and
Guru.com, you can find web developers who will work for $10 to $15 per hour. In the U.S., you can
hire students or entry-level freelancers for $20 to $30 an hour, but if you want someone
experienced, youâ€™ll pay $75 to $200 per hour.

Using offshore developers isnâ€™t always as much of a bargain as the rate difference
suggests, however. Communication difficulties can add hours to project. If a
miscommunication causes something to be built incorrectly, the cost in time and dollars can
make the low-cost labor seem very expensive.

HTML Markup for Designers

If youâ€™re a designer who prefers to stay focused on design, you can still get a lot of
benefit from developing your coding skills a little. While we advocate outsourcing at least
some of the site implementation tasks, this does not mean you can ignore all the technology.

Anyone who is serious about web design should be comfortable with HTML, as well as with at least
the easy parts of CSS. If youâ€™re not, youâ€™re cut off from your sites: you
canâ€™t tinker with them directly and see the result. This makes rapid iteration
difficult. It also makes communicating with your outsourcing partner, and evaluating their
work, more difficult.

HTML markup, when stripped of presentational detail that should not be there anyway, is
simple. This is not programming, it is markup; it doesnâ€™t demand the same skills as
does

programming.

You can mark up most content by learning only half a dozen tags. Applying HTML markup requires
little more than identifying each conceptual element, such as a heading, paragraph,Â  or
list. To apply visual styles, without needing even to know what they look like, you just apply a
CSS class, like this:

<p class=”intro”>

Learn at Least a Little CSS

If you put aside the overall layout of the page, however, and focus on a single block of text,
most CSS is simple. Thereâ€™s a small enough set of terms you need to learn, and then
writing CSS becomes a compact, easy to use, and detailed representation of how you want the
text to look. When you can adjust any aspect of the design easily, you can polish it quickly
after the initial version is built.

For example, this code specifies the style for h1 headlines:

h1 {

font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif;

font-weight: bold;

font-size: 24px;

line-height: 30px;

}

Even if you have never seen a line of CSS before, you can see how to change the size or style of the
headline.

By using a CSS framework with a grid system, such as Blueprint CSS or 960gs, you can gain access
to a simple, reliable way to layout out columns in as complex an arrangement as youâ€™d
like.

JavaScript

The technology that leads many web designers into programming is JavaScript. It is the
language of the browser, making it the primary way to have dynamic things happen in the web
browser that donâ€™t require an interaction with the server.

As with CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries make JavaScript programming dramatically
easier (only more so). jQuery, the library most designers prefer, provides a CSS-like syntax
that is designer-friendly, once you get used to a little bit of JavaScript structure. At its

simplest, for example, consider this line of jQuery code:

$(“.intro”).hide();

This says “find any elements with the CSS class ‘intro’ and hide them.” You can
probably figure out the line of jQuery to then show the elements without knowing anything
more. Inside the quotes. you can put any CSS selector. This syntax makes basic jQuery code
almost a natural extension of HTML and CSS, so writing it requires only minimal programming
knowledge.

If youâ€™re disinclined to do any programming, you can avoid JavaScript entirely and
connect up with someone who can do it for you. If you like the idea of dabbling in a little
programming, then learning jQuery is a great place to start. (See the online companion at
www.webvanta.com/5tips-resources for jQuery books and online resources.)

Whether you dabble in JavaScript code or not, you should at least understand the basics of how
it works, so you can see opportunities to enhance the user experience on your sites.

Server-Side Programming

The next step down the slippery slope of programming languages is PHP. It fits in easily
intermixed with HTML. Once you can write a little PHP, you can connect to a MySQL database
â€” just learn some SQL, and how to structure relations between tables… and, if
youâ€™re like most designers, youâ€™ve gone way off the deep end.

Once you are writing server-side code that works with a database, youâ€™re really in
hard-core programmer territory. If you arenâ€™t expert in what youâ€™re doing,
you can easily create security holes. And building an administrative interface for adding
content to theÂ  database is a non-trivial task, entirely separate from building the site
itself.

A hosted CMS such as Webvanta, WordPress, Joomla makes it possible for designers without any
programming skills to include custom database features, making this capability accessible
to far more sites.

Deciding on The Best Approach for You

    Only you can decide how far you want to go down the technology path. You need to decide if you
    want to leave all the coding to others, or be able to do some of it yourself. Whatever
    approach you choose, we recommend that you:

    - Understand HTML and CSS code enough to be able to modify it on your own.

    

    - Find one or more partners you trust to take care of the parts you donâ€™t want to do.

    

    - Understand what your partner can do and what it costs, so you can incorporate that into
    your discussions with clients.

    

    - Choose a partner who can give you quick quotes, so you can include their costs in projects
    you are quoting.

    

    - Create a clear hand-off process so whomever is implementing all or part of your design
    understands exactly what you want.

    

    - Always test thoroughly whatever gets built, and expect there to be some iteration.

    



I hope this would definitely gonna help you in your day-to-day process. So this was it for
today’s post. We’ll discuss the next point regarding “Information Architecture”
