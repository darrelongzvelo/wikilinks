The characteristic kidneys or nostrils on the grill were first seen on the BMW 303 in the early
1930s. Shown here is a BMW 2002 .



[ edit ] Pre-WWII

BMW was founded by Karl Friedrich Rapp originally as an engine manufacturer, Rapp Motor .
Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH was founded as a successor company to Rapp Motor on July 21,
1917. [1] The Milbertshofen district of Munich was chosen, apparently because it was close to
the Gustav Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik site. The blue-and-white roundel BMW logo, which is
still used (illustrated above right) alludes to the white and blue checkered flag of Bavaria .
It is often said to symbolize a spinning white propeller on a blue-sky background, although
this interpretation developed after the logo was already in use. [1]

In 1916 the company secured a contract to build V12 engines for Austro-Daimler . Needing extra
financing, Rapp gained the support of Camillo Castiglioni , Cornelius Jagdmann and Max Friz ,
the company was reconstituted as the Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH . Over-expansion caused
difficulties; Rapp left and the company was taken over by the Austrian industrialist Franz
Josef Popp in 1917, and named BMW AG in 1918. [2]

After World War I , the Treaty of Versailles (1919) prohibited the production of aircraft in
Germany. Otto closed his factory and BMW switched to manufacturing railway brakes . [2]

In 1919 BMW designed its first motorcycle engine, used in a model called the Victoria, which
was built by a company in Nuremberg . [3]

In 1924 BMW built its first model motorcycle, the R32 . This had a 500 cc air-cooled
horizontally-opposed engine, a feature that would resonate among their various models for
decades to come, albeit with displacement increases and newer technology. The major
innovation was the use of a driveshaft instead of a chain to drive the rear wheel. For decades to
follow, the shaft-drive boxer engine was the mark of the BMW motorcycle. [3]

In 1927 the tiny Dixi , an Austin Seven produced under licence, began production in Eisenach .
BMW bought the Dixi Company the following year, and this became the company's first car, the
BMW 3/15 . By 1933 BMW was producing cars that could be called truly theirs, offering steadily
more advanced I6 sports and saloons (sedans). The pre-war cars culminated in the 327 coupÃ©
and convertible, the 328 roadster , fast 2.0 L cars, both very advanced for their time, as well
as the upscale 335 luxury sedan.



[ edit ] World War II

BMW motorcycles , specifically the BMW R12 and the BMW R75 combination were used extensively
by the AufklÃ€rungsabteilung of German panzer and motorised divisions of the German Army
, Waffen SS and Luftwaffe .

BMW was also a major supplier of engines; supplying the Luftwaffe with engines and vehicles,
and the Wehrmacht with motorcycles. Planes using the aero-engines included the BMW 801 , one
of the most powerful available. Over 30,000 were manufactured up to 1945. BMW also researched
jet engines , producing the BMW 003 , and rocket-based weapons. BMW has admitted to using
between 25,000 and 30,000 slave labourers during this period, consisting of both prisoners
of war and inmates of infamous concentration camps such as Dachau [4] .

The BMW works were heavily bombed towards the end of the war. Of its sites, those in eastern
Germany ( Eisenach-DÃŒrrerhof , Wandlitz-Basdorf and ZÃŒhlsdorf ) were seized by the
Soviets . The factory in Munich was largely destroyed [3] .



[ edit ] Post-war history

After the war the Munich factory took some time to restart production in any volume. BMW was
banned from manufacturing for three years by the Allies and did not produce a motorcycle, the
R24 , until 1948, and a car model until 1952 [4] .

In the east, the company's factory at Eisenach was taken over by the Soviet Awtowelo group
which formed finally the Eisenacher Motor-Werke. That company offered "BMWs" for sale until
1951, when the Bavarian company prevented use of the trademarks: the name, the logo and the
"double-kidney" radiator grille.

The cars and motorcycles were then branded EMW (Eisenacher Motoren-Werke), production
continuing until 1955.

In the west, the BAC, Bristol Aeroplane Company , inspected the factory, and returned to
Britain with plans for the 326, 327 and 328 models. These plans, which became official war
reparations, along with BMW engineer Fritz Fiedler allowed the newly formed Bristol Cars to
produce a new, high-quality sports saloon (sedan), the 400 by 1947, a car so similar to the BMW
327 that it even kept the famous BMW grille.

In 1948 BMW produced its first postwar motorcycle and in 1952 it produced its first passenger
car since the war. However, its car models were not commercially successful; models such as
the acclaimed BMW 507 and 503 were too expensive to build profitably and were low volume.

By the late 1950s, it was also making bubble-cars such as the Isetta .

In 1959 BMW's management suggested selling the whole concern to Daimler-Benz . Major
shareholder, Herbert Quandt was close to agreeing such a deal, but changed his mind at the last
minute because of opposition from the workforce and trade unions and advice from the board
chairman, Kurt Golda . Instead Quandt increased his share in BMW to 50% against the advice of
his bankers, and he was instrumental in turning the company around.

That same year, BMW launched the 700 , a small car with an air-cooled, rear-mounted 697 cc boxer
engine from the R67 motorcycle. Its bodywork was designed by Giovanni Michelotti and the 2+2
model had a sporty look. There was also a more powerful RS model for racing. Competition
successes in the 700 began to secure BMW's reputation for sports sedans.

At the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1961, BMW launched the 1500 , a powerful compact sedan , with
front disc brakes and four-wheel independent suspension. This modern specification
further cemented BMW's reputation for sporting cars. It was the first BMW to officially
feature the " Hofmeister kink ", the rear window line that has been the hallmark of all BMWs
since then.

The " New Class " 1500 was developed into 1600 and 1800 models. In 1966, the two-door version of
the 1600 was launched, along with a convertible in 1967. These models were called the '02'
series—the 2002 being the most famous—and began the bloodline that later developed into
the BMW 3 Series .

By 1963, with the company back on its feet, BMW offered dividends to its shareholders for the
first time since before World War II.

By 1966, the Munich plant had reached the limits of its production capacity. Although BMW had
initially planned to build an entirely new factory, the company bought the crisis-ridden
Hans Glas GmbH with its factories in Dingolfing and Landshut. Both plants were restructured,
and in the following decades BMW's largest plant took shape in Dingolfing.

In 1968, BMW launched its large " New Six " sedans, the 2500, 2800, and American Bavaria , and
coupÃ©s, the 2.5 CS and 2800 CS .

Of major importance to BMW was the arrival of Eberhard von Kuenheim from Daimler-Benz AG. Just
40 years old, he presided over the company's transformation from a national firm with a
European-focused reputation into a global brand with international prestige.

Already commercially successful by the mid 60s, in December 1971, BMW moved to the new HQ
present in Munich, architecturally modeled after four cylinders.

In 1972, the 5 Series was launched to replace the New Class sedans, with a body styled by Bertone
. The new class coupes were replaced by the 3 Series in 1975, and the New Six became the 7 Series in
1977. Thus the three-tier sports sedan range was formed, and BMW essentially followed this
formula into the 1990s. Other cars, like the 6 Series coupes that replaced the CS and the M1 ,
were also added to the mix as the market demanded.

From 1970 to 1993, under von Kuenheim, turnover increased 18-fold, car production
quadrupled and motorcycle production tripled.



[ edit ] "The English Patient" - Rover



Please help improve this article or section by expanding it.Further information might be
found on the talk page or at requests for expansion .This article has been tagged since January
2007.

Between 1994 and 2000, under the leadership of Bernd Pischetsrieder , BMW owned the Rover
Group in an attempt to get into mass market production, buying it from British Aerospace . This
brought the active Rover , Mini and Land Rover brands as well as rights to many dormant marques
such as Austin , Morris , Riley , Triumph and Wolseley under BMW ownership.

The venture was not successful. For years, Rover tried to rival BMW, if not in product, then in
market positioning and "snob appeal". BMW found it difficult to reposition the English
automaker alongside its own products and the Rover division was faced with endless changes in
its marketing strategy. In the six years under BMW, Rover was positioned as a premium
automaker, a mass-market automaker, a division of BMW and an independent unit.

BMW was more successful with the Mini and Land Rover brands, which did not have parallels in its
own range at the time.

In 2000, BMW disposed of Rover after years of losses, with Rover cars going to the Phoenix
Venture Holdings for a nominal £10 and Land Rover going to the Ford Motor Company . The German
press ridiculed the English firm as " The English Patient ", after the film. BMW itself,
protected by its product range's image, was largely spared the blame. Even the British press
was not particularly sympathetic towards Rover. Land Rover has since enjoyed a greater
success as part of Ford's Premier Automobile Group.

BMW retained the rights to Mini, Rover, Triumph and other marques. MINI has been a highly
successful business, though the other names have not been used yet. The Rover name has
recently been sold to Ford after BMW gave it a first refusal offer in 2000.



[ edit ] Redesign controversy

In the early 2000s, BMW undertook another of its periodic cycles of redoing the design
language of its various series of vehicles, under the auspices of newly promoted design chief
Christopher Bangle . These designs often featured unconventional proportions with complex
concave and convex curved surfaces combined with (sometimes arbitrary-appearing) sharp
panel creases and slashes, a design cue called "flame surfacing" by Bangle. Much of the new
language did not rest well with BMW enthusiasts or the automotive press which referred to the
new designs as "Bangled" or "Bangle-ized". Bangle is commonly mistakenly believed to have
penned all of the designs himself; however, he only chose which design was to be used. As Bangle
has now been promoted within the company to the BMW Group Head of Design, leaving him in charge
of not only BMW but also Rolls-Royce and Mini , some question what long term effect the
disaffection of BMW traditionalists for these designs will have on sales, and on the
company's future. Despite this, or maybe because of it, sales at BMW have increased every year
since some of his most debated designs have gone into production.

Though many BMW enthusiasts zealously insist that BMW is the world's top selling luxury
brand, new research indicates that their sales performance has not been as a result of their
ever-growing skills in creating a luxury car. BMW's own in-house research [5] showed that 75%
of luxury car buyers do not even consider a BMW, considering it as a yuppie's car. Instead,
BMW's research indicates, that BMW owners generally purchase BMW's for the crisp, sporty
characteristics which BMW is famous for. As a result of this worrying research, BMW has
redoubled marketing efforts to chase the top selling luxury car, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.
[6]

Many aspects of the "controversial" designs are now beginning to surface in other auto
manufacturer's designs, most notably Toyota, Audi, and Honda. Though the Bangle-butt
design debuted and was popularlised by BMW's 7-Series, Hyundai incorporated this design cue
in 1999, three years before the 7-Series was released, and Maybach incorporated it since its
first showing in 1997.

What is not as well known, however, is that Bangle was also responsible for many
'conservative' BMW designs and has worked at BMW for almost a decade. The first X5 sketches
(which closely resembled the production car), were designed by him, and under his tenure the
E46 3 Series came to be. Despite much of the scorn heaped on Chris Bangle, his design selections
were approved by the entire executive board of BMW AG, including the majority owners, the
Quandt family.



[ edit ] Production outside Germany

BMW started producing automobiles at its Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant in 1994. Today,
the plant manufactures the BMW X5 , the BMW Z4 Roadster and Coupe, and the BMW Z4 M Roadster and
Coupe. The oft-rumored crossover vehicle, the X6, was recently confirmed by the Chairman of
BMW's board as being under development for production at Plant Spartanburg.

Outside Germany , the largest output of the BMW Group comes from British factories. The Hams
Hall plant manufactures four cylinder BMW engines for use around the world in 3-Series ,
1-Series and Z4 vehicles. This is in addition to MINIs and Rolls-Royces made in Oxford and
Goodwood .

The Spartanburg, SC plant is open six days a week, producing automobiles approximately 110
hours a week. It employs about 4,700 people and manufactures over 500 vehicles daily.
Recently, the plant has undergone a major renovation switching from 2 production lines down
to one. Now both the X5 and the Z4 are produced in the same line, one right after the other.

After a period of local assembly, BMW's Rosslyn, South Africa, plant now manufactures cars,
with over 70% of its output destined for export. In the mid-1990s, BMW invested R 1bn to make
Rosslyn a world-class facility. The plant now exports over 50,000 3 Series cars a year, mostly
to the USA, Japan, Australia, Africa and the Middle East.

BMW signed agreement in 1999 with Avtotor to produce cars in Kalingrad , Russia . Factory has
been assembling 3 and 5 -series cars. [5]

Starting from October 2004, BMWs intended for the Chinese market are produced in Shenyang ,
China [7] . BMW has established a joint venture with Chinese manufacturer Brilliance to build
BMW 3 Series and 5 Series that have been modified for the needs of local markets.

Starting in 2004, the X3 is manufactured in Graz , Austria by Magna Steyr with mainly German
components.

In 2005, BMW Group built a new manufacturing facility in Egypt. This plant builds 3 Series, 5
Series, 7 Series, and X3 vehicles for the African and Middle East markets.

BMW opened a production plant in Chennai , India in 2007 . This plant produces 3-series and
5-series vehicles. Showrooms are already present in all Indian metropolitan areas. [6]

The BMW Group is considering the establishment of a new plant which will be located either in
Volos , Greece or Limasol , Cyprus .These plants will be manufacturing motorcycles as well as
the BMW 1 Series and the BMW 3 Series and will be serving the markets of Eastern Europe and Middle
East .The construction will start in 2009 even if it is finally built in Greece or in Cyprus.



[ edit ] Rolls-Royce

In the early 1990s, BMW and Rolls-Royce Motors began a joint venture that would see the new
Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and Bentley Arnage adopt BMW engines.

In 1998, both BMW and Volkswagen tried to purchase Rolls-Royce Motors. Volkswagen outbid BMW
and bought the company for £430 million, but BMW outflanked its German rival. Although
Volkswagen had bought rights to the " Spirit of Ecstasy " mascot and the shape of the radiator
grille , it lacked rights to the Rolls-Royce name. Rolls-Royce plc (the aero-engine
business) retained the rights over the Rolls-Royce trademark and wished to strengthen its
existing business partnership with BMW which extended to the BMW Rolls-Royce joint venture.
Consequently, BMW was allowed to acquire the rights to the grille and mascot, and licensed the
name and "RR" logo after 2003 for £40 million. Volkswagen was permitted to build
Rolls-Royces at its Crewe factory only until 2003, but quickly shifted its emphasis to the
Bentley brand.

In the meantime, BMW was faced with the need to build a new factory and develop a new model. The
new factory at Goodwood produced the new Rolls-Royce Phantom , unveiled on January 2 , 2003 ,
and officially launched at the Detroit Auto Show on January 5 , 2003 . The model, priced around
US$330,000, has experienced record sales worldwide of 796 Phantoms sold in 2005.



[ edit ] Models



[ edit ] Current

The current BMW model lineup is split into what they call "Series 2", traditionally
identified by a single digit - e.g. the 3 Series.

In 2004 BMW announced plans to make odd-numbered series saloon/ sedan and estate /wagon
models (BMW calls its estates/wagons Touring models), while even-numbered series will be
two-door coupÃ©s and cabriolets . This convention started informally in 1976 with the
introduction of the 6 Series and later continued in 1989 with the 8 Series , but died off when the
latter was discontinued in 1999. This practice was revived as the Z4 replaced the aging Z3
roadster in 2003 and continues as the new 6 Series augments the existing BMW 5 Series .

There is possibly a chance BMW will release a V3 or V5. The V3 will probably be similar to the
3-Series, X3, and will compete against Mercedes-Benz B-Class. The V5 will probably be
similar to the 5-Series & X5, and will compete against Mercedes-Benz R-Class.

CoupÃ© versions of the 3 Series sedans have always been named 3 Series vehicles, as well. The
company had considered renaming future 2-door derivatives of the 3 Series as 4 Series cars,
but this plan has officially been shelved.

The M letter was used prior to the shift to Series-named cars to designate special
"Motorsport" models, beginning with the M1 supercar. Later the M letter was used as a prefix to
top-of-the-range models which had received special treatment by the BMW Motorsport
division. The first such car was the M535i of 1979. As these models started gaining popularity
the Motorsport division was split into a separate company. BMW M GmbH now makes sporty models
based on the production cars with very extensive chassis and engine upgrades. The M3, M5, and
M6 are based respectively on the 3, 5, and 6 Series and are recognised by enthusiasts all over
the world as truly excellent sports cars while retaining the practicality of the models they
extend.

With the advent of the SUV , BMW also added the X5 - and in 2004 the X3 - to their model range to
capitalize on this growing market. BMW calls its SUV models Sports Activity Vehicles. A
possible future V Series multi-purpose vehicle will offer practicality for large families,
similar to the Mercedes-Benz R-Class .

[ edit ] Motorcycles

Main article: BMW motorcycles

BMW introduced the R32 in 1923. It had an unusual " boxer twin " engine, with two air-cooled
cylinders protruding from opposite sides of the machine for efficient cooling. Prior to this
BMW built the "Flink" 2- stroke and "Helios" motorcycles, as well as supplying M2B15 motors to
other companies such as Victoria.

The R series and HP2 enduro have a boxer-twin engine, the K series has an I4 engine (1000 and 1200
cc) or an I3 (750 cc), and the F and G series have single cylinder and parallel twin Rotax
engines.

During WWII BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a sidecar attached. This motorcycle was
essentially an 80% interchangeable copy of the ZUndapp KS750, made by BMW to avoid producing
the KS750 under licence. Unusually, the sidecar's wheel was also driven. Combined with a
lockable differential , this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many
ways to the Jeep .

BMW motorcycles tend to be relatively light for their size, and they have a range of models that
give an off-road, sporty or relaxed and comfortable ride. All BMW motorcycles since 1923 have
used shaft drive, except for the F and G series which use either chain or belt drive.

BMW updated the traditional R design in 1993. These new bikes were principally oil-cooled
(hence, called oilheads ) and had 4 valves per cylinder. Older Rs with 2 valves per cylinder
were principally air-cooled, and were called airheads .) In 2002, BMW updated the oilhead
boxer engine, adding double spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance
shaft, an increased capacity to 1200 cc and enhanced performance to 100 hp (75 kW) for the
R1200GS , compared to 85 hp (63 kW) of the previous R1150GS. The newer BMW 1200cc boxer engine is
sometimes called the hexhead engine, due to the slightly hexagonal shape of the valve covers.
More powerful variants of the oilhead and hexhead engines are available in the R1100S and
R1200S, producing 98hp and 122hp, respectively.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It is both
powerful (the engine is a 167 hp unit derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team)
and significantly lighter than previous K models. It was BMW's latest attempt to keep up with
the pace of development of sports machines from the likes of Honda , Kawasaki , Yamaha , and
Suzuki . Innovations include a unique electronically adjustable front and rear suspension,
and a Hossack-type front fork BMW calls Duolever.

BMW was one of the earliest manufacturers to offer anti-lock brakes on production
motorcycles. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW
motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of sophisticated electronic stability
control , or anti-skid technology - a first for production motorcycles - later in the 2007
model year.

BMW is an innovator in motorcycle suspension design. Most modern examples use single-sided
rear swingarms. Their trademark front suspension design, called the Telelever, was first
seen in the early 1990s. The Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking, and is
sometimes criticized by sport riders as insulating the rider from road inputs, therefore
reducing the rider's "feel" for the roadway. The telescopic fork, also, used on the vast
majority of motorcycles today was also first introduced by BMW.



[ edit ] Motorcycle Clubs

Fanfare of the BMW motorcycle has invoked the interest in clubs, or groups of people who share
the same passion for their Bavarian bikes. The two largest BMW motorcycle clubs in the world
are headquartered in the United States. They are the BMW Riders Association ( BMW RA ) and the
BMW Motorcycle Owners of America ( BMW MOA ).



[ edit ] Culture

The term "beemer" started as an acronym for the abbreviation "BMW," adapted from the
early-20th century British pronunciation of BSA (as "beeser" or "beezer"), whose
motorcycles were often racing BMWs. Over time, the term became closely associated with BMW
motorcycles.

In the United States, the term "bimmer" was later coined to refer (exclusively) to BMW
automobiles. As such, use of the word "beemer" to refer to a BMW automobile is frowned upon by
some BMW enthusiasts, because it is the term used for motorcycles. Although the distinction
is completely arbitrary, to this day, the media, movies, and most people still use the term
"beemer" to refer to the automobiles.

The initials BMW are pronounced "beh emm veh" in German. The model series are referred to as
"Dreier" ("Three-er" for 3 series), "FÃŒnfer" ("Five-er" for the 5 series), "Sechser"
("Six-er" for the 6 series), "Siebener" ("Seven-er" for the 7 series).



[ edit ] Nomenclature

BMWs follow a certain nomenclature in the naming of their vehicles; a 3 digit number is
followed by 1 or 2 letters.

The first number is the series number. The next two numbers is the engine displacement in
liters multiplied by 10

The system of letters is as follows:

d = diesel i = fuel-injected x = all wheel drive l = long wheel base c = coupe t = hatchback (Refered
to as an Estate in countries such as the UK)

For example, a BMW 760li is a fuel-injected 7 series with a long wheel base and 6.0 litres of
displacement.

However, there are exceptions. The current BMW 328i has a 3.0 liter engine, as does the 335i
(turbocharged).



[ edit ] Community

BMW has always had a very tight and loyal community following. They're one of the few
automakers that support driving their cars to their limits, suggesting "spirited driving"
in certain operation manuals. In the summer of 2001, BMW even went as far as starting the BMW
Films website, showcasing some sporty models being driven to extremes. These videos are very
popular within the enthusiast community and have opened the eyes of many owners looking for a
sporty/fun car. However, even with all this success, on October 21st, 2005, the BMW Films were
taken offline.

Every year since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met up in Santa Barbara, CA to attend Bimmerfest .
Perhaps one of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the U.S. Over 3000 people attended in
2006, and there were over 1000 cars present. In 2007, the event will be held on May 5.
