However, if the ball becomes dead behind the goal line of the team in possession and its &quot;opponent&quot; is responsible for the ball being there (for instance, if the defense intercepts a forward pass in its own end zone and the ball becomes dead before the ball is advanced out of the end zone) it is a touchback: no points are scored and the team last in possession keeps possession with a first down at its own 20 yard line.

A touchback also occurs when the kick goes out-of-bounds in the end zone. A kickoff that goes out-of-bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is a foul, and the ball will be placed where it went out of bounds or 30\xc2\xa0yards (27\xc2\xa0m) from the kickoff spot, depending on which is more advantageous to the opposite team.\n                                    <sup id="cite_ref-kickoff_18-0" class="reference">\n                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football#cite_note-kickoff-18" shape="rect">\n                                        <u>\n                                          <font color="#0000ff">\n                                            <span>[</span>\n                                            19\n                                            <span>]</span>\n                                          </font>\n                                        </u>\n                                      </a>\n                                    </sup>\n                                    Unlike with punts, once a kickoff goes 10 yards and the ball has hit the ground, it can be recovered by the kicking team.\n                                    <sup id="cite_ref-kickoff_18-1" class="reference">\n                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football#cite_note-kickoff-18" shape="rect">\n                                        <u>\n                                          <font color="#0000ff">\n                                            <span>[</span>\n                                            19\n                                            <span>]</span>\n                                          </font>\n                                        </u>\n                                      </a>\n                                    </sup>\n                                    A team, especially one who is losing, can try to take advantage of this by attempting an\n                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onside_kick" title="Onside kick" shape="rect">\n                                      <u>\n                                        <font color="#0000ff">onside kick</font>\n                                      </u>\n                                    </a>\n                                    .

Ideally, each play is a scripted, strategically sound team-coordinated endeavor. Some plays are very safe; they are likely to get only a few yards. Other plays have the potential for long gains but at a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover.\n                                  </p>\n                                  <p>\n                                    Generally speaking, rushing plays are less risky than passing plays. However, there are relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays. To deceive the other team, some passing plays are designed to resemble running plays and vice versa. These are referred to as play-action passes and draws, respectively. There are many trick or gadget plays, such as when a team lines up as if it intends to punt and then tries to run or pass for a first down. Such high-risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work. However, they can spell disaster if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts accordingly.\n                                  </p>\n                                  <p>\n                                    The defense also plans plays in response to expectations of what the offense will do. For example, a &quot;blitz&quot; (using linebackers or defensive backs to charge the quarterback) is often attempted when the team on defense expects a pass. A blitz makes downfield passing more difficult but exposes the defense to big gains if the offensive line stems the rush.\n                                  </p>\n                                  <p>Many hours of preparation and strategizing, including film review by both players and coaches, go into the days between football games.

To stop the offense from advancing the ball, the defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking or pulling him down. As such, defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball-carrier to the ground, within certain rules and guidelines. Tacklers cannot kick or punch the runner. They also cannot grab the face mask of the runner\'s helmet or lead into a tackle with their own helmet. Despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary roughness, most other forms of tackling are legal. Blockers and defenders trying to evade them also have wide leeway in trying to force their opponents out of the way. Quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders coming on full speed from outside the quarterback\'s field of vision. This is commonly known as a blindside.\n                                  </p>\n                                  <p>\n                                    To compensate for this, players must wear special protective equipment, such as a padded plastic\n                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_helmet" title="Football helmet" shape="rect">\n                                      <u>\n                                        <font color="#0000ff">helmet</font>\n                                      </u>\n                                    </a>\n                                    ,\n                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_pads" title="Shoulder pads" shape="rect">\n                                      <u>\n                                        <font color="#0000ff">shoulder pads</font>\n                                      </u>\n                                    </a>\n                                    , hip pads and\n                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pad" title="Knee pad" shape="rect">\n                                      <u>\n                                        <font color="#0000ff">knee pads</font>\n                                      </u>\n                                    </a>\n                                    .

Most recently, virtually any contact with the helmet of a defensive player on the quarterback, or any contact to the quarterback\'s head, is now a foul. During the late 1970s, the penalty in high school football for spearing included ejection from the game.\n                                    <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference">\n                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football#cite_note-23" shape="rect">\n                                        <u>\n                                          <font color="#0000ff">\n                                            <span>[</span>\n                                            24\n                                            <span>]</span>\n                                          </font>\n                                        </u>\n                                      </a>\n                                    </sup>\n                                  </p>\n                                  <p>\n                                    Despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety, injuries remain very common in football.
