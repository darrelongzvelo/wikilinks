Posted by Thom on Thursday, February 26, 2009

Seriously, stop it.Â  Not to go all Billy Gates on you, but there’s this little
squaredÂ red X in the top right corner of your computer screen andÂ I’m begging you to
punch it in the face.Â Â  Unless you’re a transfer student, all your applications are
in, and unless you’re an early decision applicant and have already heard our decision, all
you can do now is wait for us to make up our minds and mail you a letter.Â  We’ll be shipping
those around April 1, so there’s this space between now and then that nothing new is going to
happen.Â  So step away for a while and save yourselfÂ for theÂ whirlwind of
AprilÂ when all the cards will be on the table, andÂ us college folks willÂ have to
wait for your decision.

Sam Snead , the legendary golfer said, “To be consistently effective, you must put a certain
distance between yourself and what happens to you on the golf course. This is not
indifference, it’s detachment.”Â  What he’s getting at is that in an endeavor of
difficulty where many things will go right, but many others will go wrong, the central actor
must remain calm, untroubled, above it all, as if separate from the toils.Â  It’s not a
break with caring, as Snead points out, it’s a form of personal resiliency from
theÂ stress and struggle.Â  I will at this point stop channeling my inner Bagger Vance .

Why am I writing this to you?Â  Isn’t this space just supposed to be used for updates on our
admissions process?Â  Sure, it’s that.Â  However, I feel responsible to use
thisÂ platform to 1) nudge our conversations beyond file readingÂ orÂ getting in to
Vanderbilt (or wherever), and 2)Â embolden you to view your college search experience as a
springboard for future big decisions in your life.Â  Today’s petition:Â Â be
active, be engaged, really own it,Â but have an off switch.

According to Google, more than a thousandÂ people read our blog on a weekly basis.Â 
We’re humbled by this.Â  But next week,Â we would love to see a number half that.Â 
Get away from theÂ college application process folks.Â  For a day, for a
week.Â Â We’ll leave the light on for you when you get back.Â  Plus, it’s all
archived, so it’s not going anywhere.Â  Get diverted.Â  Go for a drive, read something
for funÂ and not just in your Google Reader – preferably something with pages, download
Yakety Sax to your iPod and just try not to smile, rent Con Air on DVD and remark at how John
Malkovich ‘s career literally disintegrates in front of your eyesÂ with each passing
scene, grab a friend on that first day that feels like Spring when everyone is charged to
finally be out of doors, and just detach for a little while.Â  It’s called spring break for
a reason. It starts with that little red X up there.

    First of all, I’ve played golf with you Thom and he needs all the Bagger Vance channeling
    he can pull off. Second, I think Malkovich has had a very nice career post Con Air including
    his amazing performance as Osbournce Cox in “Burn After Reading.”

    He’s right on the main point.

    I’m very insulted that you are denying the greatness of John Malkovich. Burn After
    Reading. Art School Confidential. And, of course, Being John Malkovich. How can you deny
    joy from these awesome, quirky movies?

    …Ok, I’m clicking the red X now.

    I contend that your thespian cred evaporates at the exact nanosecond that the line
    â€œMake a move and the bunny gets it” parses your lips.

    side :)

    Hey, I know this probably alludes to my paranoia about all things college related, but
    just a quick question for you (if you’re allowed to even release these numbers, that
    is). How many students were actually rescinded last year? My grades have slipped, but not
    significantly in the slightest (just a few low Bs in the hardest courses at my high
    school). My brother attends UMichigan, and they rescinded 5 out 5000+ students last
    year, so I was just curious as to how many were rescinded here last year after being offered
    admission. Thanks! By the way, Burn After Reading was amazing.

    Hey Cornelius,

    The actual number of rescinded offers is typically very low. We will send out a handful
    (like 3 to 10) of letters that warn students that we have noticed their grades have
    diminished and that we strongly encourage those grades to improve. We have rescinded
    offers before, but it is very rare to be honest with you. We typcially won’t get worked up
    over B’s, but C’s and D’s might make us get a little cranky.
