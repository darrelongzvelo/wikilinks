Pamukkale



April 29, 2010 in Turkey | 3 comments



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/img_0792.jpg?w=300&h=224 One
year ago, we visited the calcium terraces at Pamukkale and the ruins of Heirapolis.

We had another early start from Selcuk, but I wrote in my journal that “at least we got eggy
bread for breakfast again rather than porridge which everyone is a bit sick of now”. We
headed east away from the coast through some beautiful green valleys and past some
snow-topped mountains until we got to the town of Pamukkale and the ruins of Heirapolis. There
was a massive Roman city here spread across a plateau above the plain where Pamukkale is
â€“ now there are a few buildings still with walls standing, but it is mostly just random
rocks spread across the field, and very overgrown with spring grass and wildflowers.

The really interesting thing about the place though is the thermal springs. They come up in the
centre of the ancient city and there is now a thermal bath over it (which cost 23 lira to get in!)
but the water is super calcified and where it drains down the mountain over many thousands of
years, it has left calcified terraces, called â€œtravertinesâ€�. To get up to the
ruins from Pamukkale you have to walk up and across these terraces without any shoes on, with
the water flowing down over your feet. It was a warm day with a cool breeze today when we were
there but by the time we started walking up the steep hill the cool water was nice on our feet. It
cost us 20 lira to get into the site (about Â£10) and we walked around for a couple of hours,
seeing the quite well-preserved (and partially rebuilt) theater, churches, roman roads and
other random buildings. It seemed that they knew more about the history of the city than was
obvious out in the ruins – they do know that the theater took up 4 blocks, for instance. It must
have been a huge city.

We camped that night in mountains off the side of the road. We’d been on the road for 24 days,
and this was our first night of cooking and eating in the rain. Most people went to bed as soon as
dinner was finished. I watched a movie on my iPod snug and warm and dry â€“ but the poor cook
group had to clean everything up before they went to bed.

Memories: Amazing calcium terraces with water flowing down, A woman stopping to squat and
relieve herself in one of the pools (we couldn’t believe it), Spring wildflowers all over
the ruins.

it goes an equal distance into the world within.

Celcus Library, Ephesus

One year ago, we spent three nights by the sea near the town of SelÃ§uk.

After leaving Gallipoli and crossing the Dardanelles to Ã‡anakkale, we camped for the
night before heading on to the ruins of Troy. We’d heard it really wasn’t worth seeing, so
Shane and I decided not to go in since the tickets were pretty pricey. We stayed with the Truck
and relaxed in the sunshine, and later when people started coming back, it sounded like it was
worth skipping. It may or may not even be the real remains of Troy, and apparently it was just a
jumble of rocks without any real explanations, and a pretend wooden horse.

The rest of the day we drove down the coast to reach a campsite at the beach near Selcuk. The
campsite was pretty basic but it was right on the beach, and it had a restaurant with a bar, so
another hard night’s drinking was to be had.

Nearby we visited the ruins of Ephesus . They are the ruins of an ancient Greek city, mostly
buried and extremeley well preserved. The paved streets are pretty much intact and many of the
buildings still contain mosaics and wall decorations. It was one of the most impressive ruins
complexes I’ve ever been to – very easy to visualise what it might have been like two
thousand years ago when it was inhabited.

Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/dsc_5291.jpg?w=300&h=200

Nothing like a cold one on the beach

We spent all morning at the ruins, then went into the town of SelÃ§uk itself to visit the
museum, which contains many finds and statuary from the ruins. We also visited the ruins of the
Basilica of St John, where John’s remains are said to be buried. The gospel of St John is
supposed to have been written in the city of Ephesus. We visited one of the mosques in the town,
before walking all the way back to the campsite – a hot 7km walk in the afternoon sun. We felt we
deserved a beer after that one.

The next day we did a full truck clean in the morning. This involves taking everything off the
Truck, giving it a proper spring cleaning, scrubbing all the pots and pans and re-organising
the food stores. It’s a tough job and usually takes a full morning, but if everyone pitches in
it doesn’t take quite as long.

The rest of the day was spent lazing around on the beach and doing internet things, while Adam
took the Truck away to get the broken window fixed. At this point Shane and I had been planning to
take a slight detour to visit my great grandmother’s home island of Chios, but our passports
were still in Istanbul with Steve so we wouldn’t have been able to get out of the country.Â 
I guess it means we’ll have to go back another time.



Memories: Wandering around the city of Ephesus imagining what it was like fully built,
Spotting a tourist with a full beard and joking that was what Russ would look like in a few months
(which turned out to be absolutely true!), Efes beers on the beach.

AnzacÂ Day



April 25, 2010 in Turkey | Leave a comment



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/galipoli05.jpg?w=300&h=224 One
year ago, we attended the dawn service at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli (or Gelibolu in Turkish).

95 years ago, Australian and New Zealand forces landed at Gallipoli before dawn, an error in
navigation putting them on a beach in front of huge cliffs, where they met resistance from the
Ottoman defenders. The Turks were under the leadership of one Mustafa Kemal (later known as
AtatÃŒrk), and under his leadership they defended the peninsula and the conflict became a
stalemate, with massive losses on both sides.Â  Not just Aussies and Kiwis but many other
allied troops as well as a great number of Turkish soldiers lost their lives in the area. I was
shocked to realise that the father of my great-grandfather, a Christian in Asia-Minor at the
time, may well have fought against Aussie soldiers in the defence of his home. Not long after,
the Christians were driven out of Turkey (and the Muslims from Greece) and he and his family
fled to Chios, and then Crete.

Later, once Kemal had become the country’s leader, he said these words. They are now
immortalised on a large stone monument near Anzac Cove:

Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives. You are now living in the soil of a
friendly country therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the
Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours. You, the mothers, who sent
their sons from faraway countries wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and
are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well.

The day has become a day of rememberance in Australia, New Zealand and in Turkey to remember
those who lost their lives not just in 1915, but in every war.

For more information on the day itself, the Australian Government’s site has plenty of
information.Â  The ABC have also put together an “experience”, you can enter it here .

The road down to Galipoli is beautiful, with very green with fields and forests, especially in
the afternoon sunlight. By the time we arrived it was actually dark, and freezing cold
already.

I put on as many layers as I could wear and a group of the 6 Aussies and a few others headed down the
road past the long line of tour buses and into Anzac Cove. We went through security checks where
they made us throw out our bottles of water (no alcohol allowed), but they did give us linen bags
with goodies inside like a poncho and the order of services. We couldn’t believe how
organised the whole thing was – the stage complete with lighting rigs and big screens, and
huge grandstands all around. The place was already packed, but we managed to find 14 seats more
or less together high on one of the stands at the back. By the time we were settled it was about
1:30, and a cold wind was blowing, but once I got into my sleeping bag and snuggled up I felt a lot
better.

Through the rest of the night, the band played at times and at other times they had interviews
with historians or clips from “Australians at War” on a big screen. We tried to sleep
propped against each other, wedged in our chairs with people all around us – I think I might
have got a maximum of 10 mins at any one time.

At 4:40am, a presentation started of the Gallipoli Symphony – an original composition by an
Australian composer. It was really beautiful, and was followed by a list and a reading of the
names of many soldiers who died there. Many of them were only in their 20s.

There followed 30 mins of complete silence and dark. We weren’t sure what was going on, but
read later in the programme that it was a time for reflecting. Everyone was very quiet and
patient while we listened to the small waves on the beach and the birds singing. I wondered if it
was so peaceful there in 1915.

At 5:30 the dawn service began – much the same as a service at home but it included New Zealand
and Turkish references. As the light got brighter we were able to see the sea for the first time,
silvery and like a mirror in the pre-dawn.

Once the service was over we packed up our sleeping bags and started to peel off layers, and
slowly got out of the Cove and up the steep hill to Lone Pine Cemetery, stopping at other small
cemeteries along the way. It was a perfect, blue, sunny morning, and very quickly got quite
warm in the sun. Once we’d trekked the 3km uphill to Lone Pine we decided it would have been
pretty horrible terrain to have to fight in.



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/galipoli08.jpg?w=300&h=224
Lone Pine looks like it would be a spectacular location, except that it was completely
surrounded by grandstands so you couldn’t actually see the view at all. I’d love to go back
there one time when there is no-one there just to see what it looks like normally.

We sat in the graveyard area in the sun for the Australian service, since there wasn’t a lot of
room left in the stands. This service was pretty much exactly like the services at home, and
made me quite homesick – or maybe it was sitting in the hot sun and the lack of sleep that did it.

We had another 2km or so walk down the road to the museum to meet up with the Truck, and it was a
scenic walk down with a view over the scrub and coves. We had planned to go to the Turkish service
but it started only 30 mins after the Australian one finished and there were so many people
there we couldn’t get through in time.

When we rejoined the truck, everyone was lying around in the sun, so we joined them and slept for
a good hour or so until it was time to leave. We drove to the end of the Gallipoli peninsula and got
the ferry across the Dardanelles to Ã‡anukkale, then headed offroad and found a nice
campsite whereÂ  a lot of us had a very earlly night.

    On the whole I really enjoyed the services, although I can probably do without staying up
    for a dawn service again! This time was great compared to a lot of services I’ve been to
    before in that there was a lot of information about the campaign and the history
    available, so people really had a better understanding of what had gone on there. We
    learned all this stuff at primary school, but it’s been a long time since I heard the
    stories and memories get dim. I was very impressed with the whole production and the
    behavior of the people there. #gallery-171-3 { margin: auto; } #gallery-171-3

Istanbul



April 24, 2010 in Turkey | 3 comments



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/ayasofia1.jpg?w=300&h=224 One
year ago, we spent three nights in the city of Istanbul, Turkey.

Istanbul is not, as some may think, the capital city of Turkey, but it has been the capital of
several empires before. It’s one of the places I always wanted to visit (or at least had for a
long time) so I was really excited about getting there, and it really didn’t disappoint at
all.

We stayed in a hostel in Sultanhamet, the touristy area spread over some narrow streets and
close to the attractions and Grand Bazaar. The Truck squeezed through the streets and I’m
sure we went on a complete tour of the area before we found where the hostel was. Shane and I were
happy to find that we had a room to ourselves, complete with ensuite bathroom – a delicious
treat after 16 days camping.

Just as we arrived in Istanbul, the weather decided to turn – we had had such beautiful
blue-sky spring weather for the last couple of weeks and now it was chilly and rainy at times,
but we made the most of it. Over the next few days we visited as many touristy things as we could
fit in, and I still don’t think we saw everything. We also had to do a bit of shopping for some
items to wear in Iran, as we weren’t sure how much opportunity we would have to buy other
things before getting there.

The most important thing we did while in Istanbul was to visit the Iranian embassy to apply for
our Iranian visas. We had previously paid an agent in London to prepare and send our
applications, but we needed to present ourselves in-person for it to be finalised.

Our American was flat-out refused a visa. He had known this might happen though, and was quite
prepared for it – he would be leaving us in a few weeks to fly over to India. The British in the
group were looking shaky for a while, as Gordon Brown had said something inflammatory about
Ahmedinnajacket (how do you spell his name again?), and Steve had to stay behind in Istanbul
after we had gone to try to sort the Brits out.

The Iranian embassy is officially Iranian soil, so therefore the girls had to cover our hair
and dress modestly. We headed over there early one morning looking like bunch of nuns,
terrified that our hair was showing and they wouldn’t let us into the country, only to be told
that the embassy wasn’t opening that day and we should come back another day. Eventually we
got in there on the day we left Istanbul, and sat around waiting for two hours while they
processed us. Everyone except American Rob and the Brits got through with no hassles.

Business aside, there was plenty of time to see the sights of the city. The city sits across the
border between Europe and Asia, and it is evident that the citizens of the city want to be
considered part of Europe. If it wasn’t for the Mosques with their call to prayer every few
hours and the amazing Bazaars, it would feel very much like a European city. It is easy to walk
around but if you need to get somewhere further away there is a tram system and I believe public
buses as well. Its quite an expensive city – don’t expect anything to be cheap in the
touristy areas.

Blue Mosque

This Mosque’s real name is the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (hence the name of the area,
Sultanahmet). It is very beautiful from the outside, but the inside was fairly basic. The
walls were decorated with intricate blue patterns on tiles, but essentially it is a very
functional house of prayer – no furniture apart from the elevated pulpit where the Imam
stands during prayers, and a huge, low chandelier providing light. This was our first visit to
a Mosque and I had to cover my hair. Make sure you’re also wearing long sleeves and covering
legs too when visiting – no shorts. That goes for boys too.

Aya Sofia (or Hagia Sophia in Greek)

The Aya Sofia is one of the most impressive buildings I’ve ever visited. I recommend reading
the Wikipedia article and other resources for the full history, but basically it is actually
the third church on the same site, and the current building was complete in the 4th century AD!
It was the largest cathedral in the world until the Seville Cathedral was completed in the
1500s. After the city was captured by the Ottomans the building was converted into a mosque and
all the mosaics covered up with plaster. Now that it is a museum, the beautiful Christian
murals are being uncovered again so the overall effect is a strange combination of styles.
There was also a massive scaffold in the middle of the room as they are restoring the dome, but
the massive scale of the building is not diminished.

The Harem, Topkapi Palace

TopkapÄ± Palace

Perhaps it was because it was pouring with rain all day, but we weren’t especially impressed
with the TopkapÄ± Palace. It was the home of the Ottoman Sultans during their reign, and is
ringed by a huge wall, making it a city within a city. We paid 20 lira each to get in, then another
15 lira for the Harem (about â‚¬17 each) which is really expensive. There were some huge
emeralds and diamonds in the treasury, and some odd Saint’s Possessions (Staff of Moses?
Really? A stick that’s 3 thousand years old?) but mostly the rest was slightly
underwhelming. The harem was beautifully decorated though â€“ it would have been nice
to see it without having to pay for the rest of the palace. I would still recommend going, but if
you are short on time, it’s probably not such a big loss to miss the palace.

Futbol!

Lee had arranged tickets for us to see BeÅŸiktaÅŸ vs Ankaraspor at the BeÅŸiktaÅŸ
Ä°nÃ¶nÃŒ Stadium, so a group of about 20 of us headed onto the tram and out to the stadium.
Only trouble was, it was pouring with rain the whole night and we actually ended up leaving at
half time because we were freezing cold and very wet, but it didn’t stop us joining in with the
fans as they sang songs and generally played up. Because it was BeÅŸiktaÅŸ home ground,
the stadium was filled with their supporters. They often get clashes between fans of
different clubs so the away fans have to sit in a special area covered by a cage, and there were
only three of them there! When Ankaraspor scored at one point, the three guys in the cage stood
up and cheered, and the rest of the crowd were deathly silent. But the rest of the time there was a
lot of singing and chanting going on, as at any football game.



Grand Bazaar and Spice Market

The Grand Bazaar is the first of its kind we visited and certainly the most touristy. It covers a
massive area – around 60 covered streets and areas grouped into types of goods for sale. It
extends from the top of the hill of Sultanahmet down to near the water, and I still don’t think
we saw half of it. If you visit, make sure to go downhill and out of the covered part of the bazaar
into the other areas of the bazaar – you’ll find more interesting things than clothes,
pashminas, lanterns and overpriced turkish delight. The Spice Market is a separate area –
we actually found it by accident. It’s down closer to the water, near the Galata Bridge. It is
full of different foods and colourful spices.

Hamam

Most people in the group had a Hamam at some point during our stay in Istanbul. I opted for the
mid-range Ã‡emberlitaÅŸ Hamam – a very old and quite busy place near the Bazaar. Very
steamy and I had a good scrubbing from a lady there. I felt so clean and refreshed afterwards!

Galata Tower – a great view over the city, even though it was still cloudy and quite cold up
there.

Basilica Cistern – we didn’t actually visit but everyone says it was awesome so we were
disappointed that we decided not to.

Food

    We ate a lot of kebap and drank the strong Turkish coffee, but our final night was Luke’s
    birthday so we headed out for dinner at a local restaurant. Shane and I shared a really
    delicious Lamb Testi Kebap (no it was lamb meat, not testicles) which came in an earthern
    jar that the waiter broke the bottom off in an elaborate performance to serve. It was very
    tender and delicious. Afterwards, we went back to a backpacker bar nearby and had a few
    more drinks and some dancing, and the place was completely packed with Aussies, Kiwis and
    drunk Turkish guys. The following morning, we headed out of Istanbul, destination:
    Galipoli. #gallery-151-4 { margin: auto; } #gallery-151-4 .gallery-item { float:

By the Black Sea



April 20, 2010 in Bulgaria , Turkey | 1 comment



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/blacksea1.jpg?w=300&h=224 One
year ago, we headed across the border into Turkey and visited the Black Seaside.

We had a welcome sleep-in at the Dryanovo Monastery and visited the caves nearby before
heading off. The caves are quite a big complex with a lot of stalactites etc, and were the site of
a stone age settlement. It’s all gated off now and I think we paid a few Lev to a little old man to
open the gate for us.

We drove across the lovely Bulgarian countryside all day and camped just short of the border at
an abandoned farm.Â  We were expecting police to show up and move us on, but it was actually a
group of locals who came along to tell us that there were gypsies in the area and we should be
careful. After that we really started watching our backs, but we didn’t see anything
untoward.

In the morning we headed right for the border, and lined up first at this window, then that one to
be stamped or to hand over money.Â  The border post was very large and new – since it fairly
recently became the border of the European Union, it looked like a major cash spend had
happened to get the facilities up to scratch.Â  Unfortunately their staff competence
still wasn’t all that crash hot and in all it took us about two hours to get ourselves and the
truck out of the EU and into Turkey. There didn’t seem to be anyone else trying to cross the
border, apart from a few trucks.

We drove more or less east then, through the most beautiful forested rolling hills and valleys
to get to the Black Sea coast.Â  We camped by the pebbled beach and had a great barbeque for
dinner, and beers on the beach.Â  The fire was built up after dinner into a huge bonfire
thanks to Adam and Jasper’s superb huge-log-finding skills.Â  We all sat around the fire
and tried to think of songs to sing and had a great time!

    Memories: Driving through the forested dunes thinking “How on earth are we going to get
    out of here tomorrow?”, Chopping salads for aaaages for the barbeque, Singing Khe San
    and other Aussie songs around the fire that no-one could remember the words of, Drunken
    dares including eating of rocks?!?, A few people slept on the beach and ended up with wet
    sleeping bags because the tide came in even though we were fairly sure the Black Sea
    isn’t tidal. #gallery-140-5 { margin: auto; } #gallery-140-5 .gallery-item { float:

Veliko Tarnovo



April 18, 2010 in Bulgaria , Romania | Leave a comment



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bulgaria03.jpg?w=300&h=224 One
year ago, we headed out of Bucharest and across the border into Bulgaria.

The border between Romania and Bulgaria on the southern is the very wide Danube River. We
crossed a long bridge and headed into the mountains again – Bulgaria is a beautiful country
also, and there wasn’t nearly as much rubbish lying around as there was in Romania.

We were heading for Veliko Tarnovo , one of the oldest cities in Bulgaria and a major fortress
during medieval and Ottoman times. The city is still large, the old town area being on the edges
of a cliff overlooking the Yantra River, and the new modern city conveniently tucked away on
the other side of the hill where tourists can’t see until they get to the top of the ruins of the
fort.

We arrived sooner than anticipated, which meant we had a whole 4 hours to look around the
amazing old town and castle ruins. The old town is strung along the edges of the cliff, with
windy streets and medieval houses and churches everywhere. We also walked all over the ruins
of the Tsarevets Castle area, a partially restored medieval fortress. At the top of the hill is
a small church, the inside of which is covered with modern art – very strange but beautiful.
The weather was magic – a lot warmer than we had been so far and very sunny. A few hours walking
around and an icecream later and it really felt like a holiday!



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bulgaria08.jpg?w=300&h=200
Later in the afternoon we headed further up the road to the Dryanovo monastery , where we stayed
the night in dorm rooms. It’s a beautiful spot in a gorge by a river, and I’ve written in my
journal that it was nice to sleep in a bed for the first time in two weeks even if it was a bit more
like a hammock, it was so bendy! The monastery has a resturant where they serve cheap and hearty
meals, and we even got to try out some interesting extras like chicken hearts.

It was Easter Saturday, and although we suspected something was happening in the monastery
that night because it was very busy, many of us went to bed as we assumed we wouldn’t be
invited. It turned out to be one of those things you kick yourself for not doing, because at
11pm, the bells of the church rang to call the people to midnight mass. The members of the group
who had stayed up joined in with the monks and congregation as they lit candles and walked
around the inside of the church three times to absolve their sins. They were given painted eggs
as presents – real eggs so I’m not sure how much further they made it through the trip…



    Memories: The amazing view over Veliko Tarnovo from every point in the old town, Relaxing
    in the sunshine with an icecream, The boys being upset when they found out the snorers were
    in their dorm, Bells at 11 and midnight. #gallery-128-6 { margin: auto; } #gallery-128-6

Bucharest



April 17, 2010 in Romania | 2 comments



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bucharest1.jpg?w=200&h=300 One
year ago, we spent the day in the Romanian capital, Bucharest.

Not many people actually went into town because most were recovering from the night before,
but Shane and I got the bus into town with a few others. Although Romania is now part of the EU,
Bucharest still feels like a less wealthy city than most other European cities. Much of the
city is grey, and there isn’t really any “old town” areas which gives the feeling that it
has been severely damaged at times and rebuilt. In fact as we walked around certain areas I’m
sure if it hadn’t been such a beautiful sunny day I wouldn’t have liked the city nearly as
much.

We headed through the central part of the city. When we eventually crossed the river, we just
couldn’t miss the 12-story Palace of Parliament . It’s the second largest building in the
world after the Pentagon, and is an absolute monster of a building – you have to take photos of
it from a long way away because there is no way to fit it in a picture up close. We paid 15 lei and
went through extensive security to get in to the rooms that were open, and joined an English
guided tour through some of the hugest marble rooms I’ve ever seen on the first and second
levels. The ceilings were 12m high and really elaborate, although they were completely empty
as they were ballrooms and are now let out to businesses for trade fairs and such.



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bucharest2.jpg?w=300&h=224 We
spent the rest of the day wandering around the centre of town. I don’t remember a lot about it
except that we found one small proper old town area. Many of the streets were dug up for
restoration work, but it had the feel of old parts of other European cities. We managed to get
the right bus back to the campsite – by this stage we are getting pretty good at public
transport.



Memories: Room after cavernous ballroom in the palace, each bigger than the last, Old men
playing chess in the park, Messes of wiring overhead in the streets

PeleÅŸ Castle andÂ Parties



April 16, 2010 in Romania | 2 comments



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/peles3.jpg?w=300&h=224 One year
ago, we were heading across the Romanian countryside, and visited PeleÅŸ Castle on our way
through.

PeleÅŸ Castle is just outside the town of Sinaia. It’s young as castles go as it was only
built in the late 19th century, and is set in a beautiful valley with snowy mountains nearby. We
did a guided tour of the reception rooms on the first floor for which they asked us to wear cloth
slippers over our shoes. The interiors were amazing – intricate details and different
decorations in every room, wood paneling in many rooms and sumptuous fabrics, furniture and
artwork.

It was then time to leave the mountainous area of Transylvania and into the flatter southern
part of Romania, heading for Bucharest. As we drove along the highway we had a small disaster
– a stone must have been flicked up or something and with a huge crash, one of the front windows
of the truck broke, showering the people in the front row with glass.Â  Fortunately,
auto-glass breaks into little bits rather than shards so no-one was hurt, but we had to make the
rest of the trip with the front window wide open and blowing a gale into the truck.Â  We
stopped in a town to pick up a sheet of perspex to replace the window until a glass replacement
can be found.

Later, we stopped at a supermarket for lunch and found that it was absolutely rammed with
people.Â It was Orthodox Easter the coming weekend and everything was to be shut for Good
Friday the following day, so people were out buying up as much food as they could pack into
multiple trolleys.Â  We managed to push our way around to get some food and get out again
intact, and we didn’t lose anyone.



Image:
http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bucharest_campsite.jpg?w=300&h=224
We rolled into the capital city of Bucharest mid-afternoon. Our campsite there was really
nice – there were cabins available but everyone camped on a grassy area shaded by trees and
covered in spring wildflowers. In my journal it sounds like I was happy to see the shower
facilities after another few days bush camping.

Some people walked up to a supermarket up the road to stock up on booze since the group intended
to have a proper party. And party we did. We weren’t allowed a fire at the campsite which was
probably a good thing, but we sat around in a circle and had a great time. By this stage, the group
had started forming its smaller sub-groups, and by the end of this particular night a new
couple. We’d been together just over a week, but it had been a 24-hours a day together for
several of those days so friendships were fast-forwarded to a certain extent. I won’t
mention any names since I suspect a few of the group may well read this

Image: http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?m=1129645325g

The party got a little rowdy later on – a security guard came over to ask us to quieten down. The
guys offered him a beer and he joined in! Later still, after many were in bed, it was revealed
that the security guard had pepper spray in his collection of tools. Terry’s video the next
morning showed that three of the guys had asked the guard to spray them in the face with the
pepper spray – yes, asked . The reactions involved a lot of screaming and some rolling on the
ground. Not sure what they were expecting exactly, but the drunken craziness precedent was
set.

shattered glass but being mercifully unhurt, Drunken antics at the campsite

Into Vampire Country



April 15, 2010 in Hungary , Romania | 2 comments



Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/romania3.jpg?w=300&h=224 One
year ago, we were heading through vampire country.Â  No not those vampires – the nasty
type. The books were out but I hadn’t read them yet – we were more concerned with Vlad and his
mates.

We had a (by now almost normal) early start to head out of Budapest and across the flat eastern
part of Hungary to the Romanian border. The roads immediately on the other side of the border
were terrible and there was a lot of construction work going on, possibly because it wasn’t
long since they joined the EU and the money was starting to flow.

Two days were spent driving through the beautiful Romanian countryside – flat plains
between rolling hills and mountains with snow on the top. Romania is blessed with amazing
landscapes, but unfortunately the ground was covered with litter everywhere we went.

Wood collecting for our first fire

We camped for the night on the side of an open hill with a cold wind blowing from snowy mountains
on the other side of the valley. It was the first opportunity we had to cook on a wood fire, and the
boys were sent out gathering. They only went slightly overboard, but we managed to fill up our
wood basket and still have enough for a nice warm cook and huddle-fire. Each time after that we
could have a wood fire, some would stay up late while others would go to sleep – it kind of
rotated around the group unintentionally.

Image: http://1yearago.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bran.jpg?w=300&h=200

Bran Castle

The next morning was a little frosty but porridge warmed us up as we headed off towards Bran
Castle , the legendary home of Dracula. We arrived there just after it closed, even though it
was due to stay open until 6pm and wasn’t due to open until 10 the next morning, so we didn’t
get to see the inside.Â  The gift shop was still open though, complete with naff vampire
memorabilia. I wonder how much of it has changed now after the start of
Twilight-fanaticism.Â  There were also craft and general junk markets nearby selling all
manner of things from rubber vampire masks to lacy underwear to jewelery.

We camped the night not far away by the side of a stream that was flowing near the road. We had
joked about telling ghost stories around the fire since we were in Transylvania and all, but
now I can’t remember whether we actually did.

It was another cold night but this time I had received some top advice and heated up a stone on the
fire. I took it to bed as a sort of pretend hot-water-bottle and it kept me nice and warm.

Memories: Cold wind off the mountains, Wild dogs at these campsites, Rubbish everywhere but
beautiful scenery.

The Fairytale City of Budapest

One year ago, we visited the city of Budapest, Hungary.

The previous day was Easter Sunday, and we spent the day driving from Vienna to the hungarian
border where we stopped to spend all our Euro coins and change some money into Hungarian
Forints (HUF). Although Hungary is still part of the EU, I’m pretty sure we had to stop to have
our passports looked at. I don’t think they stamped anything though.

We arrived in Budapest at our campsite in the leafy outer suburbs late in the afternoon. The
campsite itself was long and narrow and had a chairlift going up a mountain on one end of it.
There were loads of cars parked there blocking our way into the camping ground – it was the
boy’s first time to move a parked car out of our way by bouncing it. Adam squeezed the truck
through the campground and into position, then many of us headed up the mountain on the
chairlift for a great view over the city. I spent the evening updating the travel blog because
it was the first time we’d seen decent internet.

Next morning we caught the bus into the centre of Budapest.

The city is bisected by the Danube River into two parts – Buda on the western side and Pest to
the east. The Buda side is very hilly and is where the wealthy live. It also contains the old town
area, including Buda Castle . Wikipedia says there has been a castle of some sort here since the
1200s. The old town area is surrounded by walls, topped with pointed spires, and consists of
narrow windy roads with churches around every bend.

One of the beautiful churches we visited was the Matthias Church . It is covered in the most
beautiful murals inside and a colourful tiled roof on the outside. While we were exploring in
there, a choir sang a few pieces – absolute magic, I could have stayed there for hours.

On the flatter and newer Pest side, the streets are also full of trees, but they are dwarfed by
the massive early 20th century buildings. The buildings are quite run-down and look a bit
shabby, but still have very impressive architecture. We walked past St Stephen’s Basilica
and all the way down to the park where the hot springs are, but we didn’t visit the baths there
since they were quite expensive and we would be in Turkey soon enough. I have no idea how we
managed to get the right bus back again but the chairlift was at the end of the line so once we knew
we were right, we were home free.

We loved visiting Budapest – I’d say it was my favourite out of the European cities we
visited on this trip, although Prague was a pretty close second.

Memories: Camping on ledges up the side of a hill (steep stairs!) next to Jasper’s snoring
coz he had a cold, Choir singing in the Matthias Church, eating cinnamon chimney-cakes for the
first time (we saw variants in Romania and Bulgaria too), Ruins of the old castle being
excavated near the current palace, Walking walking walking.

The time to enjoy a European trip is about three weeks after unpacking.
