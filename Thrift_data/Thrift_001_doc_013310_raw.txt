How a Lack of Campaigning Helped Alvin Greene



By AmericanElephant on June 15, 2010

I’ve been saying it for at least four days , there is no mystery as to how Alvine Greene won the
primary… his name is AL GREEN. HotAir posted a blurb about this last night and a local news
channel did a story, so maybe this theory will get some traction and put this ridiculous circus
to rest.

Had Alvin Greene campaigned, people would have known who he was, heard him speak, and
determined he definitely WAS NOT the legendary Al Green .Â  But he didn’t have a
website.Â  He didn’t run any commercials.Â  He didn’t send any direct mailers.Â 
He didn’t do any radio shows.Â  He didn’t hold any rallies.Â  Other than some
supposed travel around the state, he didn’t do any campaigning at all.Â  Voters didn’t
know who he was, but they were familiar with the name… and that is all that was needed to
generate some votes.







His opponent in the Democratic primary didn’t do much campaigning either, and if he did, it
clearly wasn’t effective.Â  So voters went into the voting booth and had a choice.Â 
Did they vote for the first guy on the ballot whose name sounded like that singer with the
soulful voice, or did they vote for the other guy who they may or may not have heard of.Â 
Overwhelmingly, voters picked the guy with the familiar name and the sweet voice.Â  Why is
anyone surprised?

Seriously.Â  If my name was Richard Petty , I could win a campaign in North Carolina by 90% of
the vote, as long as I DIDN’T CAMPAIGN.Â  Every time I campaigned, I would make myself
known and my poll numbers would certainly drop because people would come to understand that I
was not THAT Richard Petty (aka The King).Â  By not campaigning, I would only help my case.

Democrats in South Carolina should be ashamed of themselves.Â  James Clyburn, without
concrete evidence of some crime, should keep his mouth shut.Â  Accusing people of crimes
without any factual basis is unethical and potentially criminal itself.Â  Not that ethics
has ever stood in the way of Clyburn before.

There is another factor here which Clyburn and other leftists don’t want to admit.Â 
South Carolina has an open primary.Â  That means political opponents (in this case
Republicans) have every right to come in and vote in the opposing party’s primary.Â  So
Republicans could legally vote for any candidate in South Carolina’s Democratic Primary,
including the one they thought was the worst candidate.Â  Did it happen?Â  I’m sure it
did to some extent.Â  But if that made the difference in the vote it only goes to prove that
Republicans may have actually been paying attention, while Democrats certainly were
not.Â  The open primary isn’t Mr. Greene’s fault or some Republican conspiracy, in
fact Republicans tried to stop open primaries EARLIER THIS MONTH.Â  At that time theÂ 
Chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party didn’t have any complaint s.

Carol Fowler, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said her party welcomes diversity
and â€œas many people as care to come.â€�

Maybe Jim Clyburn should look in her direction first if he wants someone to blame.

I don’t know where Alvin Greene got the money to file his campaign.Â  But it doesn’t
matter.Â  Alvin Greene has a very famous name.Â  He also might have benefited from the
Open Primary law in South Carolina.Â  Those two factors, coupled with his place on the
ballot and the fact that he didn’t campaign actually led him to victory.Â  There is no
mystery here.

The only thing suspicious is that Democrats are now trying to destroy this man after the
fact.Â  If they are so worried about who will lose to Jim DeMint in November, maybe they
should have done something about it before the primary.

As for the real Al Green, he has a message for the Democrats this November.Â  Get Ready .
