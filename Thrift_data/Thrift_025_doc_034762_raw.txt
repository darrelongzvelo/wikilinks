Kelly Brianne Clarkson (born April 24, 1982) is an American singer, songwriter and
occasional actress. Born in Fort Worth and raised in Burleson, Texas, Clarkson came into
prominence after becoming the winner of the inaugural season of the television series
American Idol in 2002 and later becoming the runner-up in the television special World Idol in
2003.

Clarkson was immediately signed to RCA Records by talent manager Simon Fuller and music mogul
Clive Davis after winning American Idol , and released a double A-side single " Before Your
Love "/" A Moment Like This " in 2002. Upon its release, the single topped the Billboard Hot 100
chart by breaking the record for the biggest jump to number 1 in the chart's history and
eventually became the best-selling single of 2002 in the United States. In 2003, Clarkson
released her Thankful , which contained elements of a pop and contemporary R&B sound, became a
commercial success. Its single, " Miss Independent ", became her first international hit. In
2004, Clarkson parted ways with Fuller and became managed by Jeff Kwatinetz and developed a
more rock-oriented sound with the release of her second album, Breakaway . The album became a
critical and commercial success with its international hit singles " Breakaway ", " Since U
Been Gone ", " Behind These Hazel Eyes ", and Because of You ", becoming her most successful
album to date and garnering her further global prominence as a pop rock artist.

In 2007, Clarkson took full creative direction with the release of her self-produced third
album My December . The album's lack of mainstream production input became a subject of a
dispute with Davis and Kwatinetz, who both wanted Clarkson to make significant changes and
record new material. Its lead single, " Never Again ", helped the album to become a moderate
success amidst minimal [ clarification needed ] promotion. In 2009, Clarkson returned to a
more mainstream-oriented sound with her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted , which became
a critical and commercial success. Its worldwide hit single, " My Life Would Suck Without You
", surpassed "Before Your Love"/"A Moment Like This" for the biggest leap to number one on a
single week in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, a record it still holds today. In
2011, Clarkson followed up All I Ever Wanted with the R&B, country-pop and
dance-pop-inspired Stronger , which became a critical and commercial success. It generated
more international chart-topping singles, including " Mr. Know It All " and " Stronger (What
Doesn't Kill You) ", with the latter becoming her most successful single worldwide to date.

Aside from being renowned for her title as the "Original American Idol ", [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Clarkson
is also widely known for her voice, vocal versatility and heroine image. Her music has mainly
dealt with themes of heartbreak, independence, and self-empowerment for women and young
teens. Apart from her work in music, Clarkson also ventured to television and film.
Clarkson's film debut in the romantic musical From Justin to Kelly (2003) was met with
mediocre success. She appeared in various television series such as American Dreams and Reba
, and became a guest mentor on The Voice . In a career spanning a decade, Clarkson has become the
most successful Idol contestant internationally with album sales of over 23 million and
singles sales of over 36 million worldwide, [ 5 ] according to Billboard [ 6 ] and Nielsen
SoundScan . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Clarkson's musical work has also gained her numerous accolades,
including two Grammy Awards , three MTV Video Music Awards , twelve Billboard Music Awards ,
four American Music Awards and a Women's World Award . Billboard also ranked Clarkson as the
14th-best-selling artist of the 2000s, as well as also being ranked on the top 200 album
sellers of the Nielsen SoundScan era at number 187. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 2012, she was a mentor and judge
on the TV series Duets .

[ edit ] Life and career



[ edit ] Early life and career beginnings



Clarkson was born in Fort Worth, Texas to Jeanne Ann Rose, a first-grade English teacher, and
Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer. [ 12 ] Descending from Hellenic and Welsh roots [
12 ] and raised as a Baptist, [ 13 ] Clarkson has an older brother, Jason, who appeared in one of
her music videos, and an older sister, Alyssa. [ 12 ] [ 14 ] Clarkson's parents divorced when she
was seven years old, forcing his brother to live with his father; she and her sister stayed with
their mother. [ 12 ] Clarkson's mother later married her second husband, Jimmy Taylor.

According to both Clarkson, [ clarification needed ] her family struggled financially, and
after her parents divorced, music became her refuge. She initially wanted to become a marine
biologist but has since changed her mind after viewing the film Jaws . [ 15 ] Clarkson was
educated at Pauline Hughes Middle School and in her seventh grade, her teacher, Cynthia
Glenn, overheard her singing in a hallway and asked her to audition for the school choir, in
which Clarkson told her that she had never received any professional vocal training. [ 16 ]
Clarkson later received secondary education at Burleson High School , at which she performed
in several musicals such as Annie Get Your Gun , Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Brigadoon .
[ 17 ] [ 18 ] She sang at her high school talent show, after which an audience member shared some
inspiring words with her: "God has given you this gift. You've got to sing. You're destined to
sing." Clarkson continued singing and soon started classical training, hoping that music
would be her ticket to a college scholarship. Upon graduating high school, Clarkson was
offered full scholarships to The University of Texas at Austin , University of North Texas ,
and Berklee College of Music , but later decided decline to pursue a career in music,
explaining: "I've already written so much music and wanted to try it on her own", later
figuring "you're never too old to go to college." [ 18 ]

Upon graduation, Clarkson worked several jobs to finance a demo, recording material and
tried market it to record labels, but received little response. Clarkson turned down two
recording contracts from Jive Records and Interscope Records , stating "They would have
completely pigeonholed me as a bubblegum act. [ 12 ] I was confident enough that something
better would come along." [ 17 ] In 2001, she traveled to Los Angeles, trying to pursue a career
in music. She appeared as an extra in a few television series such as Sabrina, the Teenage Witch
and Dharma & Greg and briefly worked with musician Gerry Goffin to record five demo tracks in
trying to secure a record deal. [ 1 ] Lack of other career opportunities and a fire incident in
her apartment forced Clarkson to return to Burleson, where she worked at a movie theater,
promoted Red Bull energy drinks, and worked as a telemarketer and ultimately as a cocktail
waitress in a comedy club. [ 19 ] [ 16 ]

[ edit ] 2002â€“03: American Idol and World Idol

Clarkson performed at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. , on September 11, 2002,
following her win on American Idol . Main articles: American Idol (season 1) and World Idol

Upon returning to Burleson, Clarkson was encouraged by her friends to audition for the
inaugural season of the reality television series American Idol: The Search for a Superstar
in May 2002. Despite receiving a golden ticket in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first
appearance during the second episode. Clarkson went on to win the competition on 4 September
2002 at the then Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin
Guarini and without being sent into the bottom three throughout the season. In an interview in
2012, Clarkson referred the inaugural season as " ghetto ", explaining: "On our season we were
like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever-changing every day. They did one
season of Pop Idol in the UK but America is a very different market. They dropped us off in a mall
and said find some clothes to wear on national television. I am maybe the closest to white trash
you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress." [
20 ]

Immediately after winning American Idol , Clarkson was signed to a record deal with RCA
Records , 19 Recordings , and S Records by talent manager Simon Fuller , who created American
Idol ; and music mogul Clive Davis , who was slated to executive-produce her debut album.
Clarkson was later accused of working with a record company prior to winning American Idol .
American Idol' s rules stated that a contestant was not allowed to compete on the program if
they had been linked to a record company. However, she was cleared of all allegations, as she
only had a contract in order to conduct demonstration work. [ 21 ] In 17 September, her debut
double-A-side single, " Before Your Love "/" A Moment Like This ", was released. Both songs
were performed by Clarkson during the season finale of American Idol . The single debuted at
the Billboard Hot 100 chart on the week ending 21 September 2002 at number 60. The following
week, it climbed to number 52, and subsequently ascended to number 1, breaking a 38-year-old
record set by the British band The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one after their single
" Can't Buy Me Love " rose from number 27 to number 1 in April 1964. [ 22 ] It became her first number
one single in the United States and Canada and eventually went on to become the best-selling
single of 2002 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America
(RIAA). [ 23 ] [ 24 ]

On 25 December 2003, Clarkson participated in the television special competition World Idol
in London along with the inaugural winners of the several Idol television series around the
world. Clarkson was contractually obligated to participate, and performed Aretha Franklin
's " (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman ". In 1 January 2004, she became the runner-up behind
the first Norwegian Idol Kurt Nilsen . [ 25 ] American Idol season 1 performances and results

[ edit ] 2003â€“04: Thankful



Executive produced by of Davis, Clarkson's debut album Thankful was released on 15 April
2003. The album contained aspects of pop, contemporary R&B, and gospel music, [ 26 ] [ 27 ] with
several established musicians such as Christina Aguilera , Diane Warren , The Underdogs , and
Babyface contributing on to the tracks. Released during the urban-R&B dominance, the album
was well received by several critics. However, several critics noted that her early
achievement was established due to her performances on American Idol . Allmusic critic
Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for its vocal ability: "throughout this record,
(Clarkson) makes it seem effortless and charming. She can croon, she can belt out a song, she
can be sexy and sassy while still being graceful and as wholesome as the girl next door." [ 28 ]
Henry Goldblatt of Entertainment Weekly remarked: "Clarkson glides through octaves with
the masterful control of someone who's been doing this for decades." [ 27 ] Clarkson supported
Thankful by performing in different locations around the world, such as 2003 NRL grand final ,
the first season of Australian Idol , and the second series of Pop Idol . She and American Idol
season 2 runner-up Clay Aiken co-headlined the Independent Tour throughout the United
States in 2004. Thankful debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and went on to become a
commercial success. [ 26 ] It was later certified double platinum by the RIAA, platinum in
Canada, and gold in Japan and Australia. [ 24 ]

Its lead single, " Miss Independent ", became her first international hitâ€”charting
in the top ten in five national charts, including the United States, and was later certified
gold by the RIAA. It earned Clarkson her first Grammy Award nomination for " Best Female Pop
Vocal Performance " at the 46th Grammy Awards . [ 29 ] Its follow-up single, " Low ", was released
to moderate success. And its final single, " The Trouble with Love Is ", was released as a
promotional single for the British romantic film Love Actually and failed to chart in the
United States. Her first video album, Miss Independent , was released on 18 November 2003 and
was certified gold by the RIAA. [ 24 ]

Clarkson made her film debut with Guarini with the release of the musical romantic comedy film
From Justin to Kelly in June 2003. The film was poorly received by critics [ 30 ] and was
unsuccessful at the box office , with Clarkson explaining that she was "contractually
obligated" to do the film. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Between 2002, Clarkson, along with American Idol judges
Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson and hosts Brian Dunkleman and Ryan Seacrest , participated in
the season premiere of the eighth season of the television comedy series MADtv . She also
portrayed Brenda Lee in two episodes of the television drama American Dreams between 2003 and
2004.

"Because of You" (2005)

Image: //bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.20wmf12/extensions/OggHandler/play.png At the
age of 16, Clarkson wrote the lyrics and melody to this song to cope with her emotions. The later
composition resulted in the use of the piano and a full orchestral arrangement.

Trying to distance herself from her American Idol image, Clarkson decided to part ways with
Fuller and 19 Management and hired the services of talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm .
She took more creative control and developed a more pop rock-oriented sound with the
production of her second studio album, Breakaway . Executive-produced by Davis, Breakaway
was released on 30 November 2004. Clarkson co-wrote six of the tracks with pop and rock
songwriters such as former Evanescence band members Ben Moody and David Hodges , Kara
DioGuardi , Dr. Luke and Max Martin . The title track was co-written by pop-rock singer Avril
Lavigne . The album received critical acclaim ,with Erlewine of AllMusic remarking: "What
gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound
simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off, and they are the
tracks that illustrate that Clarkson is a rare thing in the 2000s: a pop singer who's neither
hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream." [ 33 ] Breakaway became a
commercial success and eventually became her most successful album to date. After debuting
at number 3 on the Billboard 200 in 2004, [ 34 ] the album's chart longevity allowed it to become
the third-best-selling album of 2005 [ 35 ] in the United States and was certified sextuple
platinum by the RIAA. [ 24 ] The album also enjoyed success throughout the world; it topped the
charts in the Netherlands and Ireland and became the world's seventh-best-seling album of
2005 [ 36 ] and went on to sell over 12 million copies worldwide [ 37 ] â€” becoming the most
successful album by an Idol contestant in history. Clarkson supported Breakaway with the

All of the singles from Breakaway became international hits: its titular lead single, "
Breakaway ", originally served as an original song for the Disney film The Princess Diaries 2:
Royal Engagement in 2004. The single became a commercial success â€” peaking at number 6
on the Billboard Hot 100 and eventually became her longest-running No. 1 song, where it was No.
1 for 28 weeks on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Audience chart. [ 38 ] The follow-up single,
" Since U Been Gone ", became the album's most successful release â€” peaking at number 2
on the Billboard Hot 100 and eventually becoming her most successful single on the Billboard
Hot 100 to date. [ 38 ] It garnered Clarkson numerous accolades, including two MTV Video Music
Awards and a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 48th Grammy Awards.
Furthermore, the single was critically acclaimed not only by the pop music scene but as well as
by the rock music sceneâ€”such as Ted Leo , Fall Out Boy , Simple Plan , Yellowcard ,
Switchfoot , and Evanescence . [ 39 ] The third and fourth singles, " Behind These Hazel Eyes "
and " Because of You ", also followed suitâ€”peaking at number 6 and 7 on the Billboard Hot
100, respectively. "Because of You" also received critical acclaim and more success
worldwide, by topping the charts in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Switzerland. Clarkson
performed all the singles in various award shows â€” she performed "Since U Been Gone" at
the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and at the 2006 BRIT Awards ; and "Because of You" at the 48th
Grammy Awards. The final single, " Walk Away ", also enjoyed chart success, peaking at number
12 on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite releasing "Walk Away" as her only single in 2006, Clarkson
still became the most-played artist of 2006 in the United States. [ 40 ]

Clarkson's second video album, Behind Hazel Eyes , was released in 29 March 2005. In 2005, she
performed and participated in the thirtieth season of the American comedy series Saturday
Night Live , and the reality series Damage Control (TV series) with Simple Plan frontman
Pierre Bouvier . She performed " The Star-Spangled Banner " at Game 2 of the NBA Finals . [ 41 ] She
also performed during the festivities All-Star Game [ 42 ] and the 2006 Winter Olympics in
Torino, Italy ; [ 43 ] In 2006, Clarkson recorded a song entitled "Go" as a free download for the
Ford Motor Company advertising campaign. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] She has also performed " What Hurts the
Most " with Rascal Flatts at the ACM Awards and "Cigarettes" with the country duo The Wreckers
during one of their shows in Texas in 2006.

Clarkson performing at the Live Earth concert

On 22 June 2007, Clarkson's third studio album, My December , was released. Unlike Breakaway ,
the album relied on darker themes and was more rock-oriented. [ 46 ] All of the album's tracks
were co-written by Clarkson and she opted to collaborate with her band members rather than her
previous producers and collaborators. [ 47 ] [ 46 ] Its production and release became a subject
of a dispute with RCA, particularly with Davis (who ultimately decided not to executive
produce the album) and Kwatinetz. Davis noted the album's lack of professional production
input and wanted to her to re-record tracks with a more mainstream appealâ€”to which she
refused. [ 46 ] The album received substantial positive reception and debuted at number 2 on
the Billboard 200 , but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss
Kwatinetz and Live Nation to cancel its accompanying tour, the My December Tour , and
reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting acts Jon McLaughlin , Sean Kingston and
Mandy Moore . [ 48 ] [ 46 ] [ 49 ] Clarkson later hired the services of talent manager Narvel
Blackstock of Starstruck Management. Blackstock is the husband of country artist Reba
McEntire , of whom Clarkson is a close friend. A month after the album's release, Clarkson
issued an apology to Davis; she remarked: "He has been a key advisor and has been an important
force in my success to date. [ 50 ] He has also given me respect by releasing my new album when he
was not obligated to do so. I really regret how this has turned out and I apologize to those whom I
have done disservice." [ 51 ] [ 52 ] My December was certified platinum by the RIAA [ 24 ] and had
sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide. [ 53 ]

Its lead single, " Never Again ", became a commercial success due to its promotion in American
Idol . It debuted and peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her highest debut on
the chart. The subsequent singles, " Sober ", " One Minute ", and " Don't Waste Your Time ",
failed to follow suit by charting in a single chart. In 2007, Clarkson, along with Jeff Beck ,
performed a cover of Patty Griffin 's " Up to the Mountain " on the American Idol Idol Gives Back
charity special â€” which was released as a promotional single and charted at number 56
on the Billboard Hot 100. She later performed "Never Again" and " Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band " (with Joe Perry ) at the sixth season finale of American Idol . On 7 July 2007,
Clarkson performed on the American leg of Live Earth concert. [ 54 ] Clarkson also performed on
the fifth season of Canadian Idol (where she became a guest mentor), the fourth season finale
of Swedish Idol , 2007 NFL opening kickoff festivities, [ 55 ] and at the halftime show for the
Dallas Cowboys and New York Jets game on Thanksgiving Day. [ 56 ] Clarkson partnered with
NASCAR during their 2007 season, appearing in televised advertisements, performed at
pre-race concerts, promoted NASCAR Day, and appeared at the Champions' Banquet in December.
[ 57 ] In April 2008, Clarkson participated in a Papal Youth Rally at the campus of St. Joseph's
Seminary, Dunwoodie in Yonkers , New York, performing a mini-concert for those in
attendance. That was the Papal visit of Pope Benedict XVI . She performed Schubert's " Ave
Maria " for the Pope later in the day following the Pope's speech. [ 58 ]

Throughout 2008, Clarkson began her musical endeavors country music by pairing with Reba
McEntire, recording an hour-long CMT Crossroads special at Nashville 's Ryman Auditorium on
22 February 2007. [ 59 ] . Introduced by Dolly Parton , she performed "Why Haven't I Heard From
You" and " Does He Love You " with Martina McBride on the television special CMT Giants: Reba
McEntire . Clarkson also appeared on an episode of McEntire's sitcom Reba , that aired on
January 14, 2007. At the Academy of Country Music Awards on May 16, 2007, Clarkson and McEntire
sang a duet of "Because of You", which also became the lead single from McEntire's album Reba:
Duets , the song peaked at number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy Award
for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals at the 50th Grammy Awards . Clarkson and McEntire
also embarked on the 2 Worlds, 2 Voices Tour 2008 to support Reba: Duets and My December .

Clarkson at red carpet 2009 VH1 Divas

Clarkson's fourth album, All I Ever Wanted , was released on 10 March 2009. Its production
oversaw Clarkson returning to a mainstream-oriented sound by reuniting with previous
collaborators Dr. Luke, Martin, and DioGuardi, as well as collaborating with new ones
including Howard Benson , Claude Kelly , Ryan Tedder , Glen Ballard , Matt Thiessen and Katy
Perry in contributing tracks for the album. The release of All I Ever Wanted was met with
positive acclaim from music critics for its lighter themes. [ 60 ] The album also became a
commercial success; it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and stayed there for two
weeks. [ 61 ] Clarkson supported All I Ever Wanted with the All I Ever Wanted Tour from
2009â€“2012. As of May 2012, the album has sold 944,000 copies in the United States and
garnered Clarkson a second nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. [ 62 ]

Its first single, " My Life Would Suck Without You ", became an international hit. It entered
the Billboard Hot 100 at number 97 and rose to number one the following weekâ€”breaking
the record for the biggest jump to number one on a single week previously held by Britney Spears
's " Womanizer ". It also marked the second time Clarkson broke the record, the first being the
ascent of "Before Your Love"/"A Moment Like This" in 2002. [ 63 ] It also topped the charts in the
United Kingdom, Canada and Hungary. The second single, " I Do Not Hook Up ", continued the chart
success by peaking at the number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The third single, " Already Gone ",
reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. The release of "Already Gone" became a subject of a
another dispute with RCA â€” particularly with its similarities with BeyoncÃ© 's
song " Halo ", both of which were produced by Tedder. [ 64 ] Further promotion for the album was
abruptly ended at the release of its titular fourth and final singles, " All I Ever Wanted ",
which peaked at number 96 on the Billboard Hot 100; and " Cry ", which saw a limited release.

Clarkson performed as one of many main artists for the return of VH1 Divas in September 2009. [
65 ] She also became a guest mentor on the Dutch television series X Factor in November 2009.
Clarkson continued her country ventures by pairing with Jason Aldean to record the duet "
Don't You Wanna Stay " for his album My Kinda Party in November 2010. [ 66 ] They performed it
together on the tenth season of American Idol , at the 2010 CMA Awards and at the 54th Grammy
Awards . [ 67 ] It received numerous country accolades, including a nomination for a Grammy
Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards. [ 68 ]

[ edit ] 2010â€“12: Stronger and Duets



Clarkson's fifth studio album, Stronger , was released on 21 October 2011. Clarkson
described that the album was "was influenced by Prince , Tina Turner , Sheryl Crow , Radiohead
and there's a little bit of a country vibe/influence on a couple of songs." Clarkson
collaborated with several producers including Greg Kurstin , Ester Dean , Darkchild , Toby
Gad , Steve Jordan and Howard Benson . The album has received positive acclaim, with several
music critics noting the album's predominant R&B and country influences as well as
newly-developed dance-pop themes. Stronger became a commercial success, debuting at
number 2 on the Billboard 200, and has sustained chart longevity. The release of the album was
accompanied by a limited release of Clarkson's first extended play, The Smoakstack Sessions
, which featured alternate versions of Stronger and All I Ever Wanted songs. [ 69 ] Clarkson
supported Stronger with two concert toursâ€”the Stronger Tour and the co-headlining
the 2012 Summer Tour with The Fray . Stronger was certified gold by the RIAA. [ 24 ]

The lead single, " Mr. Know It All ", became an international hit, peaking at number 10 on the
Billboard Hot 100 and topping the charts in Australia and South Korea. It was later
re-released as her first solo country single in 2012. The second titular single, " Stronger
(What Doesn't Kill You) ", also became an international hit and the album's most successful
single. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for three non-consecutive weeks â€” becoming
her most commercially successful single to date by charting in over twenty-nine national
charts. As of August 2012, it has sold over 4 million copies in the United States and the United
Kingdom. The third single, " Dark Side ", was released to moderate success.

Clarkson promoted Stronger in several countries, including 2011 NRL Grand Final , [ 70 ] and
the British, American, German and, Australian versions of The X Factor . The song "Tell Me A
Lie" on the debut album by the boy band One Direction was co-written by Clarkson, which was
originally intended for Stronger . Her second extended play, iTunes Session , was released on
23 December 2011 â€” its promotional single, a cover of " I'll Be Home For Christmas ", was
released and peaked at number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100. iTunes Session later debuted at
number 85 on the Billboard 200. In 2012, she became a guest mentor on Blake Shelton 's

[ edit ] Artistry



[ edit ] Voice



Clarkson possesses the vocal range of a soprano , [ 76 ] [ 77 ] which has been described as dynamic
and robust. [ 78 ] On an interview with Good Morning America , Simon Cowell was asked of the then
six American Idol winners, who he thought had the best voice. Cowell immediately answered
that Clarkson did "by a mile", noting that she was "up there" with other great singers such as
Celine Dion . [ 79 ] Arion Berger of Rolling Stone has said of Clarkson that "her high notes are
sweet and pillowy, her growl is bone-shaking and sexy, and her midrange is amazingly
confident for a pop posy whose career is tied for eternity to the whims of her American Idol
overlords." [ 80 ] Dr. Luke , a songwriter and producer of some of Clarkson's hits, stated that
"She has powerful lungs. She's like the Lance Armstrong of vocal cords." [ 81 ] Jon Caramanica,
music critic of The New York Times , stated that Clarkson's voice is "too huge, too violent" for
warmer and sweeter vocal stylings, stating "sheâ€™s on a par with Taylor Swift when it
comes to vengeance, and sheâ€™ll do it louder and with more brutality in comparison to
her contemporary." [ 82 ] Esquire wrote that Clarkson has â€œthe best voice in the history
of pop music". [ 83 ]

[ edit ] Influences



Clarkson has often cited soul musicians such as Aretha Franklin , [ 84 ] Whitney Houston ,
Mariah Carey [ 85 ] and Etta James [ 86 ] as well as rock musicians Radiohead , Garbage , [ 84 ]
Aerosmith , and Jimi Hendrix [ 87 ] as her influences. Her audition performance of James' song "
At Last " and her final performance of Franklin's " (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman " on
American Idol garnered critical praise from both the judges of the program as well as from the
public. Clarkson also said that she has been influenced by Tina Turner and Annie Lennox . At age
eight, Clarkson was first inspired to venture into music during visit to an African-American
church in Fort Worth. She recalled: "I was like, 'Wow, whatever they're feeling, I want to feel
it too'." [ 88 ]

[ edit ] Personal life



Clarkson has had relationships with former Evanescence rock musician David Hodges , with
whom she worked on her album Breakaway ; [ 89 ] and Graham Colton , with whom she toured in 2005. [
90 ] Clarkson is currently dating Reba McEntire's stepson, talent manager Brandon
Blackstock. Clarkson told the Daily Mail "Brandon is my manager's son. I've known him for six
years but he was married. Then, suddenly, there he was at the Super Bowl and he was single". [ 91 ]

[ edit ] Political views



On December 29, 2011, Clarkson posted on Twitter that she would vote for US Congressman Ron
Paul as a 2012 presidential candidate , saying, "I love Ron Paul. I liked him a lot during the
last Republican nomination and no one gave him a chance. If he wins the nomination for the
Republican Party in 2012 he's got my vote. Too bad he probably won't." [ 92 ] After stating her
support for Paul, she came under fire on Twitter, due to her pro gay rights views. [ 93 ] She later
apologized for the Tweet, saying she did not intend to offend anyone. [ 93 ] In a recent
interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Clarkson was asked about her comments in support of
Paul and she replied with, "All I did was tweet what I thought, and people went crazy! All of a
sudden, people were like, 'You hate gay people' â€“ what? I didn't even endorse him. All I
said was that I like him. I voted for Barack , so it's not even like I'm a hardcore Republican ." [
94 ] [ dead link ]

[ edit ] Charity



In April 2007, Kelly Clarkson took part on the " Idol Gives Back ", a fundraiser for people in
poverty in both Africa and the United States, performing " Up to the Mountain " along with Jeff
Beck . [ 95 ] According to her statings, she wanted to perform that song rather to her new single "
Never Again ", which seemed to her inappropriate for the event, and didn't want to promote
herself, despite the label's pressures. She would also perform a five-song set later that
year on the American leg of Live Earth concerts opting for environmental awareness about
climate change. She is currently an ambassador of " March of Dimes ", raising money regularly
and assisting in volunteer service, having walked for " March for Babies " as well, for the
cause of improvement of the health of mothers and babies. [ 96 ] Clarkson, additionally, got
involved in the organization "Houses of Hope", who take care and build orphanages for
children in South Africa who have been affected by HIV/AIDS, abuse and poverty. [ 97 ] She has
visited those children and also participated in the "A Night for Hope" fund-raiser concert
(held by Clarkson's background vocal singers, Jill and Kate), where she performed a song she
wrote after her trip to South Africa, "You Still Won't Know What It's Like". Clarkson is also
supporting organizations Save the Children , UNICEF , " Do Something " and "STOMP Out
Bullying" among others as well as music causes like the Save the Music Foundation . [ 98 ] [ 99 ]
She has a ranch in Texas for unwanted animals, which includes amputee goats, blind dogs, and
horses with colic; there are more than 80 animals at the sanctuary. She helps provide
veterinary care for them and finds them an adoptive family. [ 91 ]
