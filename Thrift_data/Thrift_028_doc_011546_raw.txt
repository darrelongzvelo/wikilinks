Hebrew Literature



Image:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TlhSVSjrAUI/T6_Ik5D8GDI/AAAAAAAAADk/mfWVH07J3U4/s1600/images.jpg
Hebrew literature consists of ancient, medieval, and modern writings in the Hebrew language
. It is one of the primary forms of Jewish literature , though there have been cases of
literature written in Hebrew by non-Jews . Hebrew literature was produced in many different
parts of the world throughout the medieval and modern eras, while contemporary Hebrew
literature is largely Israeli literature .



Ancient Hebrew literature

Beyond comparison, the most important such work is the Hebrew Bible ( Tanakh ).

The Mishna , compiled around 200 CE, is the primary rabbinic codification of laws as derived
from the Torah . It was written in Mishnaic Hebrew , but the major commentary on it, the Gemara ,
was largely written in Aramaic . Many works of classical midrash were written in Hebrew.



Medieval Hebrew literature

Many works of medieval rabbinic literature were written in Hebrew, including: Torah
commentaries by Abraham ibn Ezra , Rashi and others; codifications of Jewish law , such as
Maimonides ' Mishneh Torah , the Arba'ah Turim , and the Shulchan Aruch ; and works of Musar
literature (didactic ethical literature) such as Bahya ibn Paquda 's Chovot ha-Levavot ( The
Duties of the Heart ). Many works of medieval philosophical literature such as the Guide to the
Perplexed and The Kuzari , as well as many works of fiction, were written in Judeo-Arabic. One
work of fiction which was written in Hebrew was the "Fox Fables" by Berechiah ben Natronai
ha-Nakdan , Hebrew fables which resemble Aesop's fables .

Much medieval Jewish poetry was written in Hebrew, including liturgical piyyutim in
Palestine in the seventh and eighth centuries by Yose ben Yose, Yanai , and Eleazar Kalir .
These poems were added to the Hebrew-language liturgy. This liturgy was compiled in book form
as "the siddur" by rabbis including Amram Gaon and Saadia Gaon .

Later Spanish, Provencal, and Italian poets wrote both religious and secular poems;
particularly prominent poets were Solomon ibn Gabirol and Yehuda Halevi .



Modern Hebrew literature

In addition to writing traditional rabbinic literature in Hebrew, modern Jews developed new
forms of fiction, poetry, and essay-writing, which are typically called "Modern Hebrew
Literature."

Shmuel Yosef Agnon - Hebrew Writer

His works deal with the conflict between the traditional Jewish life and language and the
modern world . They also attempt to recapture the fading traditions of the European shtetl
(village). In a wider context, he also contributed to broadening the characteristic
conception of the narrator 's role in literature. Agnon shared the Nobel Prize with the poet
Nelly Sachs in 1966.



Literary themes and influences

    Agnon's writing has been the subject of extensive academic research . Many leading
    scholars of Hebrew literature have published books and papers on his work, among them
    Baruch Kurzweil , Dov Sadan , Nitza Ben-Dov , Dan Miron , and Dan Laor . Agnon writes about
    Jewish life, but with his own unique perspective and special touch. In his Nobel
    acceptance speech, Agnon claimed "Some see in my books the influences of authors whose
    names, in my ignorance, I have not even heard, while others see the influences of poets
    whose names I have heard but whose writings I have not read." He went on to detail that his
    primary influences were the stories of the Bible . Agnon acknowledged that he was also
    influenced by German literature and culture, and European literature in general, which
    he read in German translation. A collection of essays on this subject, edited in part by
    Hillel Weiss , with contributions from Israeli and German scholars, was published in
    2010: Agnon and Germany: The Presence of the German World in the Writings of S.Y. Agnon.
    The budding Hebrew literature also influenced his works, notably that of his friend,
    Yosef Haim Brenner . In Germany, Agnon also spent time with the Hebraists Hayim Nahman
    Bialik and Ahad Ha'am . The communities he passed through in his life are reflected in his
    works:

    - Galicia: in the books The Bridal Canopy , A City and the Fullness Thereof and A Guest for
    the Night.

    

    - Germany: in the stories "Fernheim", "Thus Far" and "Between Two Cities".

    

    - Jaffa: in the stories "Oath of Allegiance", "Tmol Shilshom" and "The Dune".

    

    - Jerusalem: "Tehilla", "Tmol Shilshom", "Ido ve-Inam" and "Shira".

    

Nitza Ben-Dov writes about Agnon's use of allusiveness, free-association and imaginative
dream-sequences, and discusses how seemingly inconsequential events and thoughts
determine the lives of his characters. Some of Agnon's works, such as The Bridal Canopy, And
the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight, and The Doctor and His Ex-Wife, have been adapted for
theatre . A play based on Agnon's letters to his wife, "Esterlein Yakirati", was performed at
the Khan Theater in Jerusalem.

Egyptian Literature

Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known
literature. Indeed, the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it
today, that is, the book . [



   

Ancient Egyptian literature



Plates vi & vii of the Edwin Smith papyrus at the Rare Book Room, New York Academy of Medicine See
also: Ancient Egyptian literature The ancient Egyptians wrote works on papyrus as well as
walls, tombs, pyramids, obelisks and more. Perhaps the best known example of ancient
Egyptian literature is the Story of Sinuhe ; other well known works include the Westcar
Papyrus and the Ebers papyrus , as well as the famous Book of the Dead . While most literature in
ancient Egypt was so-called " Wisdom literature " (that is, literature meant for instruction
rather than entertainment), there also existed myths, stories and biographies solely for
entertainment purposes. The autobiography has been called the oldest form of Egyptian
literature.

The Nile had a strong influence on the writings of the ancient Egyptians, as did Greco-Roman
poets who came to Alexandria to be supported by the many patrons of the arts who lived there, and
to make use of the resources of the Library of Alexandria . Many great thinkers from around the
ancient world came to the city, including Callimachus of Libya and Theocritus of Syracuse .
Not all of the great writers of the period came from outside of Egypt , however; one notable
Egyptian poet was Apollonius of Rhodes .

Christian Egyptian literature

Alexandria became an important center in early Christianity during roughly the 1st to 4th
century CE. Coptic works were an important contribution to Christian literature of the
period and the Nag Hammadi library helped preserve a number of books that would otherwise have
been lost.



Islamic Egyptian literature

See also: Arabic literature  and Islamic literature By the eighth century Egypt had been
conquered by the Muslim Arabs . Literature, and especially libraries, thrived under the new
Egypt brought about by the Muslim conquerors. Several important changes occurred during
this time which affected Egyptian writers. Papyrus was replaced by cloth paper , and
calligraphy was introduced as a writing system. Also, the focus of writing shifted almost
entirely to Islam . The earliest novel written in Egypt was Ibn al-Nafis ' Theologus
Autodidactus , the earliest example of a science fiction and theological novel . The concept
of a "brief statement praising a literary product", now known as a blurb , also dates back to
medieval Egyptian literature from the 14th century, and was known as taqriz in medieval
Arabic literature .

Many tales of the One Thousand and One Nights ( Arabian Nights ) can be traced to medieval
Egyptian storytelling traditions. These tales were probably in circulation before they
were collected and codified into a single collection. Medieval Egyptian folklore was one of
three distinct layers of storytelling which were incorporated into the Nights by the 15th
century, the other two being ancient Indian and Persian folklore, and stories from Abbasid
-era Baghdad .

Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in
royal tombs It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the Per Ankh
institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of
Books), laboratories and observatories. Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian
literature, such as the Pyramid and Coffin Texts, were spoken from the New Kingdom onward and
is represented in Ramesside administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in
Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the
tomb autobiography, such as those of Harkhufand Weni. The genre known as Sebayt
(Instructions) was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles;
thelpuwer papyrus, a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social
upheaval, is a famous example.

The Story of Sinuhe, written in Middle Egyptian, might be the classic of Egyptian literature.
Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus, a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons
relating the marvels performed by priests. The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a
masterpiece of near-eastern literature. Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the vernacular
language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the Story of Wenamun and the
Instruction of Any. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar
from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700 BC, narrative stories and
instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and
business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories
written in demotic during the Graeco-Roman period were set in previous historical eras, when
Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II.



Modern Egyptian literature

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Arab world experienced a al-Nahda ,
a Renaissance -esque movement which touched nearly all areas of life, including literature.
[10] One of the most important figures from this time was Naguib Mahfouz , the first Egyptian to
win the Nobel Prize in Literature . In 1914 Muhammad Husayn Haykal wrote Zaynab , considered
the first modern Egyptian as well as Islamic novel.

Sumerian Literature





Sumerian literature is the literature written in the Sumerian language during the Middle
Bronze Age . Most Sumerian literature is preserved indirectly, via Assyrian or Babylonian
copies.

The Sumerians invented the first writing system, developing Sumerian cuneiform writing out
of earlier proto-writing systems by about the 30th century BCE. The earliest literary texts
appear from about the 27th century BCE.

The Sumerian language remained in official and literary use in the Akkadian and Babylonian
empires, even after the spoken language disappeared from the population; literacy was
widespread, and the Sumerian texts that students copied heavily influenced later
Babylonian literature .

Sumerian literature has not been handed down to us directly, rather it has been rediscovered
through archaeology . Nevertheless, the Akkadians and Babylonians borrowed much from the
Sumerian literary heritage, and spread these traditions throughout the Middle East,
influencing much of the literature that followed in this region. Ipinaskil ni

  Persia Literature

Persian literature ( Persian : Ø§Ø¯ØšÛŒØ§Øª Ù�Ø§Ø±Ø³ÛŒ ‎ or
Ø§Ø¯ØšÛŒØ§Øª ÙŸØ§Ø±Ø³ÛŒ ) spans two-and-a-half millennia,
though much of the pre- Islamic material has been lost. Its sources have been within
historical Persia including present-day Iran as well as regions of Central Asia where the
Persian language has historically been the national language. For instance, Molana (Rumi),
one of Persia's best-loved poets, born in Balkh (in what is now Afghanistan ), wrote in
Persian, and lived in Konya then the capital of the Seljuks . The Ghaznavids conquered large
territories in Central and South Asia and adopted Persian as their court language. There is
thus Persian literature from Iran , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Tajikistan and other parts of
Central Asia . Not all this literature is written in Persian , as some consider works written by
ethnic Persians in other languages, such as Greek and Arabic , to be included. At the same time,
not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians/Iranians. Particularly
Indic and Turkic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of
Persianate cultures.

Described as one of the great literatures of mankind, Persian literature has its roots in
surviving works of Middle Persian and Old Persian , the latter of which date back as far as 522
BCE (the date of the earliest surviving Achaemenid inscription, the Behistun Inscription ).
The bulk of the surviving Persian literature, however, comes from the times following the
Islamic conquest of Persia circa 650 CE. After the Abbasids came to power (750 CE), the
Persians became the scribes and bureaucrats of the Islamic empire and, increasingly, also
its writers and poets. The New Persian literature arose and flourished in Khorasan and
Transoxiana because of political reasons - the early Iranian dynasties such as Tahirids and
Samanids were based in Khorasan.

Persians wrote both in Persian and Arabic; Persian predominated in later literary circles.
Persian poets such as Ferdowsi , Sa'di , Hafiz , Rumi and Omar Khayyam are also known in the West
and have influenced the literature of many countries.

Pre-Islamic Persian literature

Nizami Mausoleum in the Republic of Azerbaijan .

Very few literary works of Achaemenid Persia have survived, due partly to the destruction of
the library at Persepolis.Most of what remains consists of the royal inscriptions of
Achaemenid kings, particularly Darius I (522–486 BC) and his son Xerxes . Many Zoroastrian
writings were destroyed in the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The Parsis who
fled to India , however, took with them some of the books of the Zoroastrian canon, including
some of the Avesta and ancient commentaries ( Zend ) thereof. Some works of Sassanid geography
and travel also survived, albeit in Arabic translations.



No single text devoted to literary criticism has survived from pre-Islamic Persia. However,
some essays in Pahlavi , such as "Ayin-e name nebeshtan" (Principles of Writing Book) and
"Bab-e edteda’I-ye" ( Kalileh o Demneh ), have been considered as literary criticism
(Zarrinkoub, 1959). [5]

Some researchers have quoted the Sho'ubiyye as asserting that the pre-Islamic Persians had
books on eloquence, such as 'Karvand'. No trace remains of such books. There are some
indications that some among the Persian elite were familiar with Greek rhetoric and literary
criticism (Zarrinkoub, 1947).



Persian literature of the medieval and pre-modern periods

While initially overshadowed by Arabic during the Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphates, New
Persian soon became a literary language again of the Central Asian lands. The rebirth of the
language in its new form is often accredited to Ferdowsi , Unsuri , Daqiqi , Rudaki , Taleb Amoli
and their generation, as they used pre-Islamic nationalism as a conduit to revive the
language and customs of ancient Persia.

In particular, says Ferdowsi himself in his Shahnama :

ØšØ³ÛŒ Ø±Ù†Ø¬ ØšØ±Ø¯Ù… Ø¯Ø± Ø§ÛŒÙ† Ø³Ø§Ù„
Ø³ÛŒ

Ø¹Ø¬Ù… Ø²Ù†Ø¯Ù‡ Ú©Ø±Ø¯Ù… ØšØ¯ÛŒÙ†
ÙŸØ§Ø±Ø³ÛŒ

"For thirty years, I endured much pain and strife,

I awaken the Ajam by this Persian [book]."



Poetry

So strong is the Persian aptitude for versifying everyday expressions that one can encounter
poetry in almost every classical work, whether from Persian literature, science, or
metaphysics. In short, the ability to write in verse form was a pre-requisite for any scholar.
For example, almost half of Avicenna 's medical writings are in verse.



Works of the early era of Persian poetry are characterized by strong court patronage, an
extravagance of panegyrics , and what is known as Ø³ØšÚ© Ù�Ø§Ø®Ø± "exalted
in style". The tradition of royal patronage began perhaps under the Sassanid era and carried
over through the Abbasid and Samanid courts into every major Persian dynasty . The Qasida was
perhaps the most famous form of panegyric used, though quatrains such as those in Omar Khayyam
's Ruba'iyyat are also widely popular.

Khorasani style, whose followers mostly were associated with Greater Khorasan , is
characterized by its supercilious diction, dignified tone, and relatively literate
language. The chief representatives of this lyricism are Asjadi , Farrukhi Sistani , Unsuri ,
and Manuchehri . Panegyric masters such as Rudaki were known for their love of nature, their
verse abounding with evocative descriptions.

Through these courts and system of patronage emerged the epic style of poetry, with Ferdowsi
's Shahnama at the apex. By glorifying the Iranian historical past in heroic and elevated
verses, he and other notables such as Daqiqi and Asadi Tusi presented the " Ajam " with a source
of pride and inspiration that has helped preserve a sense of identity for the Iranian peoples
over the ages. Ferdowsi set a model to be followed by a host of other poets later on.

The 13th century marks the ascendancy of lyric poetry with the consequent development of the
ghazal into a major verse form, as well as the rise of mystical and Sufi poetry . This style is
often called "Araqi style" , (western provinces of Iran were known as Araq-e-Ajam or Persian
Iraq) and is known by its emotional lyric qualities, rich meters, and the relative simplicity
of its language. Emotional romantic poetry was not something new however, as works such as Vis
o Ramin by Asad Gorgani , and Yusof o Zoleikha by Am'aq Bokharai exemplify. Poets such as Sana'i
and Attar (who ostensibly have inspired Rumi ), Khaqani Shirvani , Anvari , and Nizami , were
highly respected ghazal writers. However, the elite of this school are Rumi , Sadi , and Hafiz
Shirazi .



Regarding the tradition of Persian love poetry during the Safavid era, Persian historian
Ehsan Yarshater notes, "As a rule, the beloved is not a woman, but a young man. In the early
centuries of Islam, the raids into Central Asia produced many young slaves . Slaves were also
bought or received as gifts. They were made to serve as pages at court or in the households of the
affluent, or as soldiers and bodyguards. Young men, slaves or not, also, served wine at
banquets and receptions, and the more gifted among them could play music and maintain a
cultivated conversation. It was love toward young pages, soldiers, or novices in trades and
professions which was the subject of lyrical introductions to panegyrics from the beginning
of Persian poetry, and of the ghazal.

In the didactic genre one can mention Sanai 's Hadiqat-ul-Haqiqah (Garden of Truth) as well as
Nizami 's Makhzan-ul-AsrÄ�r (Treasury of Secrets). Some of Attar 's works also belong to
this genre as do the major works of Rumi , although some tend to classify these in the lyrical
type due to their mystical and emotional qualities. In addition, some tend to group Naser
Khosrow 's works in this style as well; however true gems of this genre are two books by Sadi , a
heavyweight of Persian literature, the Bustan and the Gulistan .

After the 15th century, the Indian style of Persian poetry (sometimes also called Isfahani or
Safavi styles) took over. This style has its roots in the Timurid era and produced the likes of
Amir Khosrow Dehlavi , and Bhai Nand Lal Goya .

Indian Literature



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K6ljl9KwKEI/T6_D-MWxj8I/AAAAAAAAACk/fIInhlojfu8/s1600/literature.jpg
Indian literature refers to the literature produced on the Indian subcontinent until 1947
and in the Republic of India thereafter. The Republic of India has 22 officially recognized
languages .

The earliest works of Indian literature were oraly transmitted. Sanskrit literature begins
with the Rig Veda a collection of sacred hymns dating to the period 1500–1200 BCE. The
Sanskrit epics Ramayana and Mahabharata appeared towards the end of the first millennium
BCE. Classical Sanskrit literature flourished in the first few centuries of the first
millennium CE [ citation needed ] , as did the Tamil literature and the PÄ�li Canon  



In the medieval period, literature in Kannada and Telugu appeared in the 5th and 11th
centuries respectively.Later, literature in Marathi , Bengali , various dialects of Hindi ,
Persian and Urdu began to appear as well. Early in the 20th century, Bengali poet Rabindranath
Tagore became India's first Nobel laureate . In contemporary Indian literature, there are
two major literary awards; these are the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship and the Jnanpith Award .
Eight Jnanpith awards each have been awarded in Hindi and Kannada , followed by five in Bengali
, four in Malayalam , and three in Gujarati , Marathi and Urdu and 2 each in Assamese , Tamil and
Telegu

Classical Sanskrit literature

Main article: Sanskrit literature The famous poet and playwright KÄ�lidÄ�sa wrote
two epics: Raghuvamsha ( Dynasty of Raghu ) and Kumarasambhava ( Birth of Kumar Kartikeya );
they were written in Classical Sanskrit rather than Epic Sanskrit. Other examples of works
written in Classical Sanskrit include the PÄ�á¹‡ini 's Ashtadhyayi which
standardized the grammar and phonetics of Classical Sanskrit. The Laws of Manu is an
important text in Hinduism. KÄ�lidÄ�sa is often considered to be the greatest
playwright in Sanskrit literature, and one of the greatest poets in Sanskrit literature,
whose Recognition of Shakuntala and Meghaduuta are the most famous Sanskrit plays. He
occupies the same position in Sanskrit literature that Shakespeare occupies in English
literature . Some other famous plays were Mricchakatika by Shudraka, Svapna Vasavadattam by
Bhasa , and Ratnavali by Sri Harsha. Later poetic works include Geeta Govinda by Jayadeva .
Some other famous works are Chanakya 's Arthashastra and Vatsyayana 's Kamasutra .



Prakrit literature

The most notable Prakrit languages were the Jain Prakrit (Ardhamagadhi), Pali , Maharashtri
and Shauraseni .

One of the earliest extant Prakrit works is HÄ�la 's anthology of poems in Maharashtri, the
GÄ�hÄ� SattasaÄ« , dating to the 3rd to 5th century CE. KÄ�lidÄ�sa and Harsha
also used Maharashtri in some of their plays and poetry. In Jainism , many Svetambara works
were written in Maharashtri.

Many of AÅ›vaghoá¹£a 's plays were written in Shauraseni as were a sizable number of
Jain works and Rajasekhara 's Karpuramanjari . Canto 13 of the Bhaá¹­á¹­ikÄ�vya is
written in what is called "like the vernacular" ( bhÄ�á¹£Ä�sama ), that is, it can be
read in two languages simultaneously: Prakrit and Sanskrit .



Pali literature

Main article: Pali Canon The Pali Canon is mostly of Indian origin. Later Pali literature
however was mostly produced outside of the mainland Indian subcontinent , particularly in
Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia .

Pali literature includes Buddhist philosophical works, poetry and some grammatical works.
Major works in Pali are Jataka tales , Dhammapada , Atthakatha , and Mahavamsa . Some of the
major Pali grammarians were Kaccayana, Moggallana and Vararuci (who wrote Prakrit Prakash
).

Japanese Literature



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZY_dbyMML9I/T6_JEQjYeDI/AAAAAAAAADs/tNNAAi8rv-0/s320/istockphoto_3042966-japanese-literature.jpg
Early works of Japanese literature were heavily influenced by cultural contact with China
and Chinese literature , often written in Classical Chinese . Indian literature also had an
influence through the diffusion of Buddhism in Japan . Eventually, Japanese literature
developed into a separate style in its own right as Japanese writers began writing their own
works about Japan, although the influence of Chinese literature and Classical Chinese
remained until the end of the Edo period . Since Japan reopened its ports to Western trading and
diplomacy in the 19th century, Western and Eastern literature have strongly affected each
other and continue to do so.



Ancient literature (until 794)

Before the introduction of kanji from China, Japanese had no writing system. At first,
Chinese characters were used in Japanese syntactical formats, and the result was sentences
that look like Chinese but were read phonetically as Japanese. Chinese characters were
further adapted, creating what is known as man'yÅ�gana , the earliest form of kana , or
syllabic writing. The earliest works were created in the Nara period . These include Kojiki
(712), a work recording Japanese mythology and legendary history; Nihon Shoki (720), a
chronicle with a slightly more solid foundation in historical records than Kojiki ; and
Man'yÅ�shÅ« (759), a poetry anthology. One of the stories they describe is the tale of
Urashima TarÅ� , which has been identified as the earliest example of a story involving
time travel





Classical literature (794–1185)

Classical Japanese literature generally refers to literature produced during the Heian
period , referred to as the golden era of art and literature. Genji Monogatari (early 11th
century) by a woman named Murasaki Shikibu is considered the pre-eminent masterpiece of
Heian fiction and an early example of a work of fiction in the form of a novel . Other important
writings of this period include the Kokin WakashÅ« (905), a waka -poetry anthology, and
Makura no SÅ�shi (990s), the latter written by Murasaki Shikibu's contemporary and
rival, Sei ShÅ�nagon , as an essay about the life, loves, and pastimes of nobles in the
Emperor's court. The iroha poem, now one of two standard orderings for the Japanese syllabary
, was also developed during the early part of this period.

The 10th century Japanese narrative, Taketori Monogatari , can be considered an early
example of proto- science fiction . The protagonist of the story, Kaguya- hime , is a princess
from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, and is found and raised by a
bamboo cutter. She is later taken back to her extraterrestrial family in an illustrated
depiction of a disc-shaped flying object similar to a flying saucer .Another notable piece of
fictional Japanese literature was Konjaku MonogatarishÅ« , a collection of over a
thousand stories in 31 volumes. The volumes cover various tales from India , China and Japan.
In this time, the imperial court particularly patronized the poets, most of whom were
courtiers or ladies-in-waiting. Reflecting the aristocratic atmosphere, the poetry was
elegant and sophisticated and expressed emotions in a rhetorical style. Editing the
resulting anthologies of poetry soon became a national pastime.



Medieval literature (1185–1603)

During this period, Japan experienced many civil wars which led to the development of a
warrior class, and subsequent war tales, histories, and related stories. Work from this
period is notable for its insights into life and death, simple lifestyles, and redemption
through killing. A representative work is The Tale of the Heike (1371), an epic account of the
struggle between the Minamoto and Taira clans for control of Japan at the end of the twelfth
century. Other important tales of the period include Kamo no ChÅ�mei's HÅ�jÅ�ki
(1212) and Yoshida KenkÅ�'s Tsurezuregusa (1331).

Other notable genres in this period were renga , or linked verse, and Noh theater. Both were
rapidly developed in the middle of the 14th century, the early Muromachi period .





Early-modern literature (1603–1868)

Literature during this time was written during the largely peaceful Tokugawa Period
(commonly referred to as the Edo Period ). Due in large part to the rise of the working and middle
classes in the new capital of Edo (modern Tokyo ), forms of popular drama developed which would
later evolve into kabuki . The jÅ�ruri and kabuki dramatist Chikamatsu Monzaemon became
popular at the end of the 17th century. Matsuo BashÅ� wrote Oku no Hosomichi (1702), a
travel diary. Hokusai , perhaps Japan's most famous woodblock print artist, also
illustrated fiction as well as his famous 36 Views of Mount Fuji .

Many genres of literature made their dÃ©but during the Edo Period, helped by a rising
literacy rate among the growing population of townspeople, as well as the development of
lending libraries. Although there was a minor Western influence trickling into the country
from the Dutch settlement at Nagasaki , it was the importation of Chinese vernacular fiction
that proved the greatest outside influence on the development of Early Modern Japanese
fiction. Ihara Saikaku might be said to have given birth to the modern consciousness of the
novel in Japan, mixing vernacular dialogue into his humorous and cautionary tales of the
pleasure quarters. Jippensha Ikku wrote TÅ�kaidÅ�chÅ« Hizakurige , which is a mix
of travelogue and comedy. Tsuga Teisho, Takebe Ayatari, and Okajima Kanzan were
instrumental in developing the yomihon , which were historical romances almost entirely in
prose, influenced by Chinese vernacular novels such as Three Kingdoms and Shui hu zhuan . Two
yomihon masterpieces were written by Ueda Akinari : Ugetsu monogatari and Harusame
monogatari wrote the extremely popular fantasy/historical romance NansÅ� Satomi
Hakkenden in addition to other yomihon. SantÅ� KyÅ�den wrote yomihon mostly set in the
gay quarters until the Kansei edicts banned such works, and he turned to comedic kibyÅ�shi
. Genres included horror, crime stories, morality stories, comedy, and
pornography—often accompanied by colorful woodcut prints.

Nevertheless, in the Tokugawa, as in earlier periods, scholarly work continued to be
published in Chinese, which was the language of the learned much as Latin was in Europe





Modern literature (1868–1945)





The Meiji period marks the re-opening of Japan to the West, and a period of rapid
industrialization. The introduction of European literature brought free verse into the
poetic repertoire; it became widely used for longer works embodying new intellectual
themes. Young Japanese prose writers and dramatists struggled with a whole galaxy of new
ideas and artistic schools, but novelists were the first to successfully assimilate some of
these concepts.



A new colloquial literature developed centering on the " I novel ", with some unusual
protagonists such as the cat narrator of Natsume SÅ�seki 's Wagahai wa neko de aru ( I Am a Cat
). [ dubious – discuss ] Natsume SÅ�seki also wrote the famous novels Botchan and Kokoro
(1914). Shiga Naoya , the so called "god of the novel," and Mori ÅŒgai were instrumental in
adopting and adapting Western literary conventions and techniques. RyÅ«nosuke
Akutagawa is known especially for his historical short stories. Ozaki KÅ�yÅ� ,
KyÅ�ka Izumi , and Ichiyo Higuchi represent a strain of writers whose style hearkens back
to early-Modern Japanese literature.



In the early Meiji period (1868–1880s), Fukuzawa Yukichi authored Enlightenment
literature, while pre-modern popular books depicted the quickly changing country. Then
Realism was brought in by Tsubouchi ShÅ�yÅ� and Futabatei Shimei in the mid-Meiji
(late 1880s–early 1890s) while the Classicism of Ozaki KÅ�yÅ� , Yamada Bimyo and
KÅ�da Rohan gained popularity. IchiyÅ� Higuchi , a rare woman writer in this era, wrote
short stories on powerless women of this age in a simple style in between literary and
colloquial. KyÅ�ka Izumi , a favored disciple of Ozaki, pursued a flowing and elegant
style and wrote early novels such as The Operating Room (1895) in literary style and later ones
including The Holy Man of Mount Koya (1900) in colloquial.



Romanticism was brought in by Mori ÅŒgai with his anthology of translated poems (1889) and
carried to its height by TÅ�son Shimazaki etc. and magazines MyÅ�jÅ� and
Bungaku-kai in early 1900s. Mori also wrote some modern novels including The Dancing Girl
(1890), Wild Geese (1911), then later wrote historical novels. Natsume SÅ�seki , who is
often compared with Mori ÅŒgai, wrote I Am a Cat (1905) with humor and satire, then depicted
fresh and pure youth in Botchan (1906) and SanshirÃŽ (1908). He eventually pursued
transcendence of human emotions and egoism in his later works including Kokoro (1914) his
last and unfinished novel Light and darkness (1916).



Shimazaki shifted from Romanticism to Naturalism which was established with his The Broken
Commandment (1906) and Katai Tayama 's Futon (1907). Naturalism hatched " I Novel "
(Watakushi-shÃŽsetu) that describes about the authors themselves and depicts their own
mental states. Neo-romanticism came out of anti-naturalism and was led by KafÅ« Nagai ,
Jun'ichirÅ� Tanizaki , KÅ�tarÅ� Takamura , HakushÅ« Kitahara and so on in the
early 1910s. Saneatsu MushanokÅ�ji , Naoya Shiga and others founded a magazine Shirakaba
in 1910. They shared a common characteristic, Humanism. Shiga's style was autobiographical
and depicted states of his mind and sometimes classified as "I Novel" in this sense.
RyÅ«nosuke Akutagawa , who was highly praised by Soseki, wrote short stories including
RashÅ�mon (1915) with an intellectual and analytic attitude, and represented
Neo-realism in the mid 1910s.



During the 1920s and early 1930s the proletarian literary movement, comprising such writers
as Takiji Kobayashi , Denji Kuroshima , Yuriko Miyamoto , and Ineko Sata produced a
politically radical literature depicting the harsh lives of workers, peasants, women, and
other downtrodden members of society, and their struggles for change.



War-time Japan saw the dÃ©but of several authors best known for the beauty of their language
and their tales of love and sensuality, notably Jun'ichirÅ� Tanizaki and Japan's first
winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature , Yasunari Kawabata , a master of psychological
fiction. Ashihei Hino wrote lyrical bestsellers glorifying the war, while TatsuzÅ�
Ishikawa attempted to publish a disturbingly realistic account of the advance on Nanjing.
Writers who opposed the war include Denji Kuroshima , Mitsuharu Kaneko , Hideo Oguma , and Jun
Ishikawa .



Post-war literature



World War II , and Japan's defeat, deeply influenced Japanese literature. Many authors wrote
stories of disaffection, loss of purpose, and the coping with defeat. Osamu Dazai 's novel The
Setting Sun tells of a soldier returning from Manchukuo . ShÅ�hei ÅŒoka won the Yomiuri
Prize for his novel Fires on the Plain about a Japanese deserter going mad in the Philippine
jungle. Yukio Mishima , well known for both his nihilistic writing and his controversial
suicide by seppuku , began writing in the post-war period. Nobuo Kojima 's short story "The
American School" portrays a group of Japanese teachers of English who, in the immediate
aftermath of the war, deal with the American occupation in varying ways.

Prominent writers of the 1970s and 1980s were identified with intellectual and moral issues
in their attempts to raise social and political consciousness. One of them, KenzaburÅ�
ÅŒe wrote his best-known work, A Personal Matter in 1964 and became Japan's second winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Mitsuaki Inoue had long been concerned with the atomic bomb and continued in the 1980s to write
on problems of the nuclear age, while Shusaku Endo depicted the religious dilemma of the
Kakure Kirishitan , Roman Catholics in feudal Japan, as a springboard to address spiritual
problems. Yasushi Inoue also turned to the past in masterful historical novels of Inner Asia
and ancient Japan, in order to portray present human fate.



Avant-garde writers, such as KÅ�bÅ� Abe , who wrote fantastic novels such as Woman in
the Dunes (1960), wanted to express the Japanese experience in modern terms without using
either international styles or traditional conventions, developed new inner visions.
Yoshikichi Furui tellingly related the lives of alienated urban dwellers coping with the
minutiae of daily life, while the psychodramas within such daily life crises have been
explored by a rising number of important women novelists. The 1988 Naoki Prize went to Shizuko
Todo for Ripening Summer , a story capturing the complex psychology of modern women. Other
award-winning stories at the end of the decade dealt with current issues of the elderly in
hospitals, the recent past (Pure- Hearted Shopping District in KÅ�enji , Tokyo), and the
life of a Meiji period ukiyo-e artist. In international literature, Kazuo Ishiguro , a native
of Japan, had taken up residence in Britain and won Britain's prestigious Booker Prize .



Haruki Murakami is one of the most popular and controversial of today's Japanese authors. His
genre-defying, humorous and surreal works have sparked fierce debates in Japan over whether
they are true "literature" or simple pop-fiction: KenzaburÅ� ÅŒe has been one of his
harshest critics. Some of Murakami's best-known works include Norwegian Wood (1987) and The
Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1994–1995). Another best-selling contemporary author is Banana
Yoshimoto .

Although modern Japanese writers covered a wide variety of subjects, one particularly
Japanese approach stressed their subjects' inner lives, widening the earlier novel's
preoccupation with the narrator's consciousness. In Japanese fiction, plot development
and action have often been of secondary interest to emotional issues. In keeping with the
general trend toward reaffirming national characteristics, many old themes re-emerged,
and some authors turned consciously to the past. Strikingly, Buddhist attitudes about the
importance of knowing oneself and the poignant impermanence of things formed an
undercurrent to sharp social criticism of this material age. There was a growing emphasis on
women's roles, the Japanese persona in the modern world, and the malaise of common people lost
in the complexities of urban culture.

Popular fiction, non-fiction, and children's literature all flourished in urban Japan in
the 1980s. Many popular works fell between "pure literature" and pulp novels, including all
sorts of historical serials, information-packed docudramas, science fiction, mysteries,
detective fiction , business stories, war journals, and animal stories. Non-fiction
covered everything from crime to politics. Although factual journalism predominated, many
of these works were interpretive, reflecting a high degree of individualism. Children's
works re-emerged in the 1950s, and the newer entrants into this field, many of them younger
women, brought new vitality to it in the 1980s.



Manga (comic books) have penetrated almost every sector of the popular market. They include
virtually every field of human interest, such as a multivolume high-school history of Japan
and, for the adult market, a manga introduction to economics, and pornography. Manga
represented between 20 and 30 percent of annual publications at the end of the 1980s, in sales
of some ¥ 400 billion per year.

Cell phone novels appeared in the early 21st century. Written by and for cell phone users , the
novels—typically romances read by young women—have become very popular both online and
in print. Some, such as Love Sky , have sold millions of print copies, and at the end of 2007 cell
phone novels comprised four of the top five fiction best sellers.

Ibahagi sa Twitter Ibahagi sa Facebook Arabic Literature

Arabic literature ( Arabic : Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø¯Øš Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±ØšÙŠ, al-Adab
al-‘ArabÄ« ‎) is the writing produced, both prose and poetry , by writers in the Arabic
language . The Arabic word used for literature is adab which is derived from a meaning of
etiquette , and implies politeness, culture and enrichment.

Arabic literature emerged in the 5th century with only fragments of the written language
appearing before then. The Qur'an , widely regarded as the finest piece of literature work in
the Arabic language , would have the greatest lasting effect on Arabic culture and its
literature. Arabic literature flourished during the Islamic Golden Age , but has remained
vibrant to the present day, with poets and prose-writers across the Arab world achieving
increasing success.

Antara Ibn Shadad, a slave who loved Abla, a wealthy woman. The period before the writing of the
Qur'an and the rise of Islam is known to Muslims as Jahiliyyah or period of ignorance. Whilst
this ignorance refers mainly to religious ignorance, there is little literature before this
time, although significant oral tradition is postulated. Tales like those about Sinbad and
Antar bin Shaddad were probably current, but were recorded later. The final decades of the 6th
century, however, begin to show the flowering of a lively written tradition. This tradition
was captured over two centuries later with two important compilations of the Mu'allaqat and
the Mufaddaliyat .



The Qur'an and Islam







Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/NaskhQ.JPG/220px-NaskhQ.JPG

The Qur'an was one of the first major works of Arabic literature and definitely the most
influential. The Qur'an had a significant influence on the Arab language. The language used
in the Qur'an is called classical Arabic and while modern Arabic is very similar, the
classical is still the style to be admired. Not only is the Qur'an the first work of any
significant length written in the language it also has a far more complicated structure than
the earlier literary works with its 114 suras (chapters) which contain 6,236 ayat (verses).
It contains injunctions , narratives , homilies , parables , direct addresses from God,
instructions and even comments on itself on how it will be received and understood. It is also,
paradoxically, admired for its layers of metaphor as well as its clarity, a feature it
mentions itself in sura 16:103.

Although it contains elements of both prose and poetry, and therefore is closest to Saj or
rhymed prose , the Qur'an is regarded as entirely apart from these classifications. The text
is believed to be divine revelation and is seen by Muslims as being eternal or 'uncreated'.
This leads to the doctrine of i'jaz or inimitability of the Qur'an which implies that nobody
can copy the work's style.

This doctrine of i'jaz possibly had a slight limiting effect on Arabic literature;
proscribing exactly what could be written. The Qur'an itself criticises poets in the 26th
sura, actually called Ash-Shu'ara or The Poets:









This may have exerted dominance over the pre-Islamic poets of the 6th century whose
popularity may have vied with the Qur'an amongst the people. There were a marked lack of
significant poets until the 8th century. One notable exception was Hassan ibn Thabit who
wrote poems in praise of Muhammad and was known as the "prophet's poet". Just as the Bible has
held an important place in the literature of other languages, The Qur'an is important to
Arabic. It is the source of many ideas, allusions and quotes and its moral message informs many
works.

Aside from the Qur'an the hadith or tradition of what Muhammed is supposed to have said and done
are important literature. The entire body of these acts and words are called sunnah or way and
the ones regarded as sahih or genuine of them are collected into hadith. Some of the most
significant collections of hadith include those by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Muhammad ibn
Isma'il al-Bukhari .

The other important genre of work in Qur'anic study is the tafsir or commentaries Arab
writings relating to religion also includes many sermons and devotional pieces as well as the
sayings of Ali which were collected in the 10th century as Nahj al-Balaghah or The Peak of
Eloquence .
