HISTORY !!!

As Hey! Say! 7 (Temporary Group)

    

    - In a KAT-TUN spring concert on 3 April 2007, 5 members of Johnny's Jr's were named to be
    part of a new group called Hey! Say! 7. These members were Yuya Takaki , Daiki Arioka ,
    Ryosuke Yamada , Yuto Nakajima , and Yuri Chinen . Initially, the temporary status of the
    group was unclear, worrying a lot of fans of Johnny Jr's groups J.J. Express as it could
    mean that the group was splitting up and that Yuya Takaki and Daiki Arioka would
    permanently be in this group instead.

    

    

    - On 16 June 2007, it was announced that Hey! Say! 7 would release a single, Hey! Say!, which
    was then used as the opening song for the popular anime Love★Com ( Lovely Complex ). The
    single also contains the ending song used for the same anime, titled BON BON. This is the
    first time a Johnny's Jrs group released a single since Ya-Ya-yah in 2002, and there was
    uncertainty in whether if the debut is permanent or just a CD release.

    

    

    - On 1 August 2007, the single Hey! Say! was released. The following week, on 8 August [ 1 ] At
    the same time, Hey! Say! 7 broke an all-time record by being the youngest male group to ever
    reach the number 1 spot in the Oricon chart, with their average age being just 14.8 years. [
    2 ] 2007, Oricon Style confirmed that Hey! Say! sold 120,520 copies in its first week and
    this made it top the Oricon Weekly Charts.

    

    

    - In the month of August, the single Hey! Say! topped the Oricon Monthly Charts,
    outselling even their Johnny's Entertainment seniors, Tackey and Tsubasa and TOKIO .
    Since then, the Hey! Say! single had been certified gold by the RIAJ. [ 3 ]

    



Transition to Hey! Say! JUMP

    

    - On 24 September 2007, in a live television event from the Johnny's Jr's concert in
    Yokohama Arena, it was announced that the group would debut under a new name. Hey! Say!
    JUMP consists of all 5 members of Hey! Say! 7, now split into two subgroups and are joined by
    5 other Johnny's Jr's. It has also been announced that they will debut their single on 14
    November 2007, titled Ultra Music Power, and the song will also be used as Japan's
    Volleyball World Cup Relay 2007 Theme Song

    

    - In July 2008 it was announced that the groups third new single Your Seed would be used as
    the image song for Kung-Fu Panda's japanese release.

    



Former Hey! Say! 7 (Temporary Group)



The former Hey! Say! 7 (temporary group) which existed from 3 April 2007 - 23 September 2007
consists of 5 members. This group no longer exists, although the name had been recycled to be
used as a new subgroup under Hey! Say! JUMP. The members of this group have been split up into the
two new subgroups.

Stalking & Robbery Incident



On June 16 , 2009 , Morimoto was robbed by a 17-year old fan who had followed him on multiple
occasions for a period of six months, leading Morimoto's parents to consult police the past
December. Morimoto was ambushed by the fan on the way home from work at the train station, and
agreed to talk with him in a nearby restaurant with the intention of asking the fan to stop his
behaviour. After being threatened by the suspect that he had a knife, Morimoto tried to
contact his parents, leading to his phone being robbed and the suspect fleeing. The suspect
was found and arrested at three the next morning by Kanagawa police at the train station after
he called Morimoto's back-up phone to arrange another meeting and the call was traced. [ 1 ] The
issue received widespread press coverage as it is one of the more serious incidents of
stalkings of idols known in Japan's recent history, in that it involved a weapon. The suspect
is believed to have slight mental issues that are in need of addressing. The stalker also
appears to have been quite well known among Hey! Say! JUMP fans as the stalking had been a well
known fact. Morimoto's agency has asked fans to please honour the official and unofficial
rules set down by the fan clubs as they support their idols.
