Regarding Kakariki

Regarding Kakariki

By Duncan • March 30, 2011 • 8 comments

One of the joys of blogging for a widely read blog is that it gives one a platform on which to moan
and complain about subjects which interest the blogger and no one else in particular. In that
particular spirit I hope to set the record straight on two separate issues that revolve around
a genus of parakeets found mostly, but not exclusively, in New Zealand. The genus is
Cyanoramphus , and they are sometimes known collectively as the kakariki (literally little
kaka).

What set this off? Picking up a bargain copy of the latest edition of the Parrots of the World by
Joseph Forshaw. It’s a great book, don’t get me wrong. The illustrations are lovely and
the cverage everything you’d expect from world experts. Joseph has forgotten more than I
will ever know when it comes to parrots. But I’ve spent a lot of time working with kakariki,
museum specimens, and the treatment of the genus in the book doesn’t match up with what I
know.

Let’s back up a little bit and introduce the parakeets. The kakariki are an odd group of
parakeets, particularly in terms of their distribution. They occur, or have occurred, on
almost every island in the far-flung archipelago that is New Zealand, from the subtropical
Kermadecs in the far north to the sub-Antarctic and treeless AntipodesÂ  (the only group
from which they never seem to have occurred is the tiny Snares group). In addition they are (or
were) found on the Australian islands of Lord Howe, Norfolk and Macquarie, as well as the
larger tropical New Caledonia. In addition to this tight clustering of related parakeets,
the genus also had two species in the far-flung Society Islands (now in French Polynesia).
These species, recorded by early European explorers, are now sadly extinct, but the disjunct
distribution is something of a mystery. It was long expected that the fossil record would show
extinct members of the genus in the islands between New Zealand/New Caledonia and the Society
Islands (places like Tonga, Fiji, the Cook Islands) that had gone extinct before Europeans
arrived, but no such fossils have been found.

My first complaint about Forshaw’s treatment of the kakariki is taxonomic. He lists four
extant species, along with the two extinct species. These are the insular endemicÂ 
Antipodes Parakeet ( Cyanoramphus unicolor ), the largest species and one famous for digging
up storm-petrels to eat (I guess there aren’t many fruiting trees on the windswept
Antipodes); the Orange-fronted Parakeet ( Cyanoramphus malherbi ), a critically
endangered species now restricted to a few spots on South Island; the Yellow-crowned
Parakeet ( Cyanoramphus auriceps) a widespread species found on the main islands of New
Zealand as well as the Chatham and Auckland Islands, and finally the Red-crowned Parakeet, (
Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) found from New Caledonia to the Auckland and Antipodes.
Lumped with the Yellow-crowned Parakeet is the rare Chatham form forbesi , and the
Red-crowned Parakeet has numerous subspecies, hochstetteri (Antipodes) , cyanurus
(Kermadecs), cooki (Norfolk), saissetti ( New Caledonia) and chathamensis (the Chathams).

Perhaps I should be grateful for four species. Heather and Robinson, in the definitive field
guide for New Zealand, list only three, lumping the Orange-fronted Parakeet as a morph (not
even a subspecies!) of the Yellow-crowned Parakeet. Such a classification is perhaps
justified if you are only looking at external morphology and plumage. The Orange-fronted
Parakeet varies very little from that of the Yellow-crowned Parakeet. Compared to that of say
the Collared Kingfisher , for example, it would hardly raise an eyebrow.

Implicit in such a view is that New Zealand was the evolutionary home of the genus, and that it
has radiated out from there across the Pacific. This view, along with the taxonomy, is
actually wrong, and has been out of date for almost a decade. Wee Boon, a student at Victoria
University of Wellington (the place I attend), examined the DNA of as many species and
subspecies of kakariki as he could in order to construct a phylogeny of the genus. The results
were surprising, not just in how it elevated a number of subspecies to species level, but for
the evolutionary history that the phylogeny revealed.The kakariki are not a New Zealand
genus, they seem to have originated in New Caledonia. That is where their closest relatives,
the horned parakeets of the genus Eunymphicus, are found. It also showed that the New
Caledonian Red-crowned Parakeet was a separate and basal clade within the genus. The
ancestor of both genera appears to have come from Australia , possibly from stock that also
have rise to the rosellas, at least 20 million years ago. Incidentally the two genera form a
sister clade to another Pacific genus, Prospeia , the shining-parrots, a gorgeous trio of
parrots endemic to Fiji.

As you can see from the phylogeny, neither the Orange-fronted Parakeet nor the Chatham
Parakeet belong with the Yellow-crowned Parakeet. Similarly, apart from the Chatham race of
Red-crowned Parakeet, the other subspecies with red crowns are distinct, and can only be
lumped with the Red-crowned Parakeet if every other kakariki is too. It seems that the
red-crown is the ancestral phenotype, from which the yellow crown is a derived
characteristic that evolved separately on three occasions (for the Orange-fronted,
Yellow-crowned and Chatham Parakeet respectively). The study did not examine the extinct
species of Lord Howe Island, the Society Islands or Macquarie Island (it did report findings
on Macquarie but the specimen was later reported to be a misidentified Red-crown from the
Antipodes).

If this were simply an exercise in scientific showing off this wouldn’t really matter very
much. But it does matter. Consider the title of a 1981 article in the New Zealand
ornithological journal Notornis, “ The orange-fronted parakeet (Cyanoramphus
malherbi) is a colour morph of the yellow-crowned parakeet (C. auriceps) “. As journal
article titles go that is pretty forthright. Conservation budgets are tight, and why save a
morph, even a distinctive one, when there are species that need help? Indeed, subspecies are
themselves lower conservation priorities than species. The Grey Duck is expected to become
extinct in New Zealand soon, but is not the subject of conservation efforts as it remains
common elsewhere.

How you draw species limits has implications for assessing the situation of species, and the
situation facing the Cyanoramphus parakeets is bad. As already noted two species have been
lost, in addition populations (of uncertain taxonomic status) have been lost from three
islands have been lost (Macquarie and Lord Howe were both encountered by European
scientists, but the presence of the genus on Campbell Island was only recently discovered via
fossils). The surviving species and populations have mostly all declined, underscoring the
importance of knowing what constitutes a species. Under the splits proposed by Boon, the New
Caledonian Parakeet is listed as vulnerable and the Chatham and Norfolk Parakeets are both
endangered. The Reischekâ€™s Parakeet ( Cyanoramphus hochstetteri) isn’t treated
as a separate species by the IUCN, the only split that isn’t, but if it were it would probably
warrant a precautionary vulnerable status similar to the Antipodes Parakeet (the island is
predator free but vulnerable to a freak event).Â  Of the other three species the
Orange-fronted Parakeet is critically endangered (but survived its brush with
unimportance), the Red-crowned Parakeet is mostly restricted to offshore islands and
considered vulnerable. The Yellow-crowned Parakeet is the only relatively secure species,
still relatively common on mainland New Zealand and listed as near threatened.

Taxonomy is important, but not I should add, essential. A lot of the important recovery work on
the Norfolk Parakeet, which was down to only 30 odd birds and around 4 females, was done prior to
the split. But one source I have read described an increase in conservation efforts for the
Chatham Parakeet once its specific status was established. Considerable efforts are also
being made to save the Orange-fronted Parakeets after their population crashed from 700 to
less than 200 between 1999 and 2000 (due to bad rat plagues caused by beech masting). Would such
efforts have been made were it still considered a mere “morph” ( as it was as late as 1998 )?

This has gone on a little longer than I intended! So I’ll talk about the second problem
surrounding the kakariki next week. In the meantime we can all reflect on the importance of
taxonomy beyond giving us armchair ticks.

    Great article, Duncan! This is a bunch of birds I have been entirely ignorant of up until
    now and I find this stuff fascinating. Looking forward to part (or problem) two.

    New Zealand is the nightmare of any world twitcher (not that I am one): too many endemic
    island forms that are hard to see (with many islands being off-limits) and that
    frequently get elevated to species levels. Which means that it will take ages, numerous
    special permits and several trips to see all endemic species. And even if you’ve
    mastered that, you’ll have to return a couple’ years later because of all the splits
    that have occured in the meantime.

    Not that I’d mind that… but then I am not a world birder.

    This was a mean post: how will I be able to go on living, knowing there is a Horned Parakeet
    out there, a species I have never seen and am unlikely to ever see. Thanks for that, Duncan!

    It isn’t like I have seen it… yet. New Caledonia is top of my to-do list while I’m in
    New Zealand but the place is brutally expensive.

    As for hard to see kiwi species, I think it would be hard to beat the Auckland Island Rail or
    the Chatham Snipe.

    Or the Black Robin, or the Chatham Parakeet, or the Little Spotted Kiwi, or the Kakapo,…
    and even though Orange-fronted Parakeets are generally not off-limits, they are not
    exactly guaranteed during a short field excursion even within their range, right?

    And the emotional side of the problem is that we are not talking about different
    Acrocephalus warblers that are only distinguished from each other by primary spacing or
    song. We are talking about some of the world’s most enigmatic and fascinating species.

    * SIGH *

    And New Caledonia isn’t only very far away from Europe, it is also brutally expensive??

    * DOUBLE SIGH *

    To be honest I think the Auckland Rail pretty much has most of them beat. There are ways and
    means of getting to see the Chatham species, or the Kakapo, revolving around
    volunteering for DOC. But Disappointment and Adams Islands, which are the only places
    you’ll see the Auckland Rail, I’m not aware of anyone going to them often at all.

    And Little Spotted Kiwi are not hard to find.

    And New Caledonia seems particularly expensive if you’re using Kiwi dollars. With
    pounds or Euros it probably seems fine.

Is Bird Banding Controversial?



I was under the impression that bird banding or ringing was universally appreciated as a
valuable instrument in the ornithological arsenal. Â Apparently, not everyone agrees .
Help clarify this issue… is there widespread controversy around banding or simply slight
opposition?

Parrotlets Name Their Babies



Parrots in the wild are always awesome, but parrotlets hold a special place in many hearts,
including mine. Here’s something else to love about these petite pocket parrots:
Grrlscientist reports that Green-rumped Parrotlets name their babies . Cool, right? And I
suspect the population studied is this group studied by Nick Sly back in 2008.
