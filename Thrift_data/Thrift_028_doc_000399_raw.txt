TechCrunk Link

During the “Back to the Mac” event two weeks ago, Steve Jobs made a particularly witty
remark as he unveiled the MacBook Air, one that made the audience chuckle in laughter:

“We asked ourselves, what would happen if a MacBook and an iPad hooked up? Well, this is the
result, we think it’s the future of notebooks.”

There is always a strategic intent with the things that Apple says at product launches,
especially when they come from Steve Jobs. This is because Apple cares deeply about the
perception of its products. By intimating that the Air is the future, and that it blends the
best of the MacBook Pro and iPad, Apple is signaling a lot. There is no doubt that this first
phase in “hooking up” between the MacBook and iPad foretells a deeply converged future on
many levels.

iOS and OS X Aren’t Hooking Up  

Often when people visualize the convergence of the iPad and MacBook lines, they wonder
whether a unified operating system will take over, which somehow blends the best of both the
touch and “mouse” metaphors.

This is unrealistic and silly. Though iOS is OS X’s little cousin—both use different APIs
and layers, but reside on top of UNIX—merging them makes little sense from an end-user
perspective. iOS and OS X serve different use-cases, applications, and markets, and the
touch metaphor on a MacBook simply wouldn’t serve a user well in the majority of cases. And
running multiple browser tabs and multitasking between 8 open applications requires a much
more immersive experience than iOS may ever provide.

But despite the fundamental difference in how we interact with a MacBook and iPad, Jobs made
sure to deeply blend how we view the two products at the marketing level, by touting attributes
like the Air’s ability to turn on instantly, and last 30 days without a charge.

Why the Hardware is Rapidly Intersecting

One reason why Steve Jobs wants us to think about the MacBook Air as an extension of the iPad, is
because there is a hardware convergence happening under the hood. The MacBook Air benchmarks

Image:   were the most telling sign that this is occurring. Apple was able to double the system
performance of the MacBook Air, despite using the same 3 year-old CPU technology from
Intel—Intel Core 2 Duo processors running at pokey speeds.

Though profound this isn’t surprising—the Air uses flash instead of spinning disks, and
SSD technology dramatically cuts data transfer bottlenecks for applications that are I/O
(Input/Output) constrained. And guess what? Most simple computing tasks are memory and
IO-constrained. This fact helps the flash-based Air operate on par with Apple’s high end
MacBook Pro line , except under taxing CPU-intensive scenarios such as video rendering.

So let’s get this straight: Apple is using several year old technology, and the Air’s
system performance screams. This is nothing short of incredible proof that after a certain
threshold, CPU advancements are only adding incremental benefit to 90% of what the user cares
about today.

Instead, performance is more dependent on graphics processing than ever. This is why Apple
designed the Lion

Image:   OS to heavily focus on OpenCL

Image: , which leverages parallel constructs within the GPU to extend its utility to
non-graphics tasks. And a big reason why Apple didn’t go with Intel’s newer CPU line is
they lack support for OpenCL, and Apple is probably designing new applications like iLife 11
to take advantage of OpenCL’s power.

The fact that Apple’s sexiest new Notebook didn’t go with Intel’s latest technology is
damning for Intel and is the best signal yet of how innovation in PCs is getting blown away

Image:   by what’s happening in the mobile ecosystem. Right now, benchmarks show that the
fastest ARM-based smartphone CPUs are only about 25% as fast as the Core 2 Duo that Apple is
using in the MacBook Air. But this delta will compress fast.

In about 2-3 years we will be seeing integrated chipsets make their way up the food chain, and
potentially fit in notebook-class form factors. Multicore ARM solutions, based on ARM-15

Image: , will make this a reality in about 2 cycles of Moore’s Law.

Skeptics will say “no way — never, not with the need for Flash”. I agree that Flash is
probably here to stay on desktops. But all the pressure on Adobe to make Flash better is, ever so
slowly, improving how rendering and compositing are done in hardware. And even in the midst of
their darkest public battle last Spring, Apple and Adobe were cooperating in getting Flash
acceleration to work on desktop Macs. In the future, it’s conceivable that Flash could be
the only remaining bottleneck that prevents Apple from using an embedded SoC in a MacBook Air.
But hardware acceleration for Flash is approaching which can solve this dilemma.

All of this rapid advancement in what’s under the hood has huge ramifications for the future
of the MacBook Air and iPad. Anyone want a MacBook Air that is several pounds, Runs OS X, lasts
for 30 hours, has a detachable keyboard, and then converts to an iPad running iOS once the
screen is removed?

I am not saying that Apple is going to make this device, nor that it’s even in their best
interest to pursue one-size-fits-all form factors. But there is no denying that the hardware
is converging, and the “Back to the Mac” theme of Apple’s latest event deeply intimated
this.

The Mac Store’s Incredible Network Effect

The remaining puzzle piece in the intersection of the MacBook and iPad is all about the
applications—both end-user discovery & distribution and developer support. The iOS
storefront was the genius behind the iPhone becoming a low friction distribution warehouse
for content.

In much the same way, the Mac Store is Apple’s umbrella strategy to encourage developers of
long-tail content to have an easy landing pad on the Mac, developers who are already building
apps on top of iOS.

Interestingly, the Mac Store allows Apple to do the reverse of what Microsoft is doing with
Windows Phone 7: whereas Microsoft can leverage .NET familiarity to encourage the desktop
dev community to write apps for WM7, Apple will use its iOS franchise to kick-start a vibrant
ecosystem of Mac developers.

But there’s also something more magical that this network-effect provides for Apple: by
specifying that developers use Apple’s tools, namely Xcode

Image:   and LLVM

Image: , Apple gains a layer of control in how this hardware convergence plays out.

How so? Apple can have developers simply flip a recompile switch and upload universal
versions of apps to the Mac App Store, which work on both ARM and x86. In this way, Apple is
setting up a distribution mechanism to host and install code which will allow them to
transition hardware seamlessly.

This is the ultimate in streamlined distribution, since a developer can focus on one unified
environment based around Cocoa Touch and Objective-C, along with a set of UI / UX constraints.
Apple then abstracts all this from the user, independent of the hardware.

Apple Hates Control and Loves Optionality

If it’s not completely clear yet, Apple is setting the stage to be processor and component
agnostic. This not only allows them the above-mentioned architecture-neutrality, but also
affords them incredible pricing power, and ensures they can tap into consistent component
supply, which will be a critical challenge as they lock up an even bigger slice of the supply
chain.

Apple can build an A4-variant themselves, or they can partner up with one of many vendors. If
Intel starts innovating again, that’s an easy choice for Apple. If nVidia, with its
graphics pedigree, emerges as a winner in combining GPUs with ARM-based CPUs, Apple can
partner more deeply or buy the company. Or Apple might decide to stick with x86, but use GPU/CPU
technology from AMD.

It’s all about optionality. And Apple is building that into its long-term strategy, by
combining its rapidly expanding footprint in mobile hardware / software with its iOS
developer mind-share to rev its Mac franchise into much higher gear.

Wow Hooking Up Feels Amazing – When’s Our Next Date?

I believe it’s pretty clear: Apple wants to use OS X, running on an incredibly battery
efficient MacBook Air-like form factor, as a bottoms-up strategy to attract loyal iOS fans
over to the Mac franchise. After all, there are around 150M users of iOS worldwide. Apple knows
that iOS is a secret weapon to bring both consumers and corporate users to higher end Mac
products. And the marketing around the Back to the Mac event is just a precursor for Apple’s
underlying strategy in mixing these two worlds.

Behind-the-scenes, Steve Jobs is setting up all the pieces for Apple to converge these
product lines. But it’s all about optionality for Apple. When and how they choose to get
there is up to them. And my guess is Steve Jobs is going to do so in a way that continues to make the
Apple experience a superior one for you, its loyal customer. Tweet tags: Apple , Software ,

Why Mobile Innovation is Blowing Away PCs

This post originally appeared on TechCrunch.

On the heels of the latest Android phone, the Sprint HTC EVO , and as we approach iPhone 4, it
seems like mobile devices and platforms are innovating at about five times the pace of
personal computers.Â 

Rapid advancement in mobile is often attributed to the natural disruption by which emerging
industries innovate quickly, while established markets like PCs follow a slower, more
sustained trajectory.

But there are deeper fundamentals driving the breathtaking pace of smartphone advancement.
Component vendors supplying to smartphone OEMs have evolved a much different DNA than those
supplying to PC makers. Smartphones are an evolution of embedded systems, not PCs, and
embedded markets have long favored vendors who don't simply provide the most highly
integrated chipsets, but who can also partner with OEMs to drive system-level integration
and software at a rapid pace.

Hardware / Chipset Integration Differences in Smartphones vs PCs:

Intel's monopoly in PC processors and peripheral chipsets has caused PC innovation to
stagnate. "Chipsets" sit alongside a CPU and integrate auxiliary functions such as wireless
and peripherals. By â€œbundlingâ€� chipsets with processors, Intel neutralizes
competition on PC motherboards. Exceptions such as graphics exist, but Intel essentially
"decides" 90% of what will (and wonâ€™t) be included on next generation PCs.

A great example of this is around lack of GPS in laptops. The fact that I have to type in my
starting address on Google Maps on my $1,500 MacBook Air serves as a constant reminder that PC
innovation has plateaued (even Mac hardware is controlled by Intel). It's no surprise people
reach for their iPhone when in front of a computer â€“ the mobile experience is often
better.

GPS is just one example of the ever-widening gap between PCs and smartphones. Sure, PC makers
could add a separate GPS chip to the motherboard, but why hasnâ€™t Intel pursued
location as a core piece of IP in its chipsets to drive a better mobile experience?

Itâ€™s simple â€“ they donâ€™t need to. Intel loves high margins, and their
market monopoly allows them to pursue margin at the expense of innovation.

In contrast, smartphone vendors have traditionally competed in a fragmented supply chain,
integrating at a breakneck pace just to survive.Â  Today's 3G wireless chipsets integrate
GPS, Bluetooth, and 802.11n on a single chip. And the competition between great companies
like Qualcomm and Marvell not only spurs further integration, but also drives vendors to
differentiate in system integration and software.

System Level Integration and Support Differences in Smartphones vs PCs:

System integration is the term for how hardware and software combine to create a finished
platform. In PCs, Intel dictates the pace of hardware releases â€“ OEMs essentially
wait for CPU updates, then differentiate through inventory control, channel / distribution
and branding. Intel wins no matter which PC makers excel â€“ they literally
donâ€™t care if itâ€™s Asus, Dell or HP.

In the smartphone world, itâ€™s the opposite. Dozens of component vendors fight each
other to the death to win designs at smartphone OEMs. This competitive dynamic forms an
entirely different basis for how component vendors approach system integration and
support.

Consider Infineon, which supplies the 3G wireless chipset in the iPhone. In order to stay in
Appleâ€™s graces, Infineon must do everything necessary to help the hardware and
software play well together, including staffing permanent engineers in Cupertino or
sending a team overnight from Germany. Do you think Intel does this for Dell?

This level of commitment helps smartphone OEMs to iterate platforms much more quickly than
they could do so alone. If Infineon slacks off at Apple, other vendors are pushing to get inside
the next iPhone. This competitive dynamic simply doesnâ€™t exist in PCs, which is
actually a fascinating side-story to why Intel and Microsoft have traditionally failed in
most embedded (non-PC) markets.

Software Platform Differences in Smartphones vs PCs:

We all know Apple deserves credit for starting the first wave in smartphone OS innovation and
for restructuring the wireless industry. And though we harp on Android for fragmentation
issues, Google's commitment to moving the OS forward is noble considering Microsoft has only
released 3 Windows refreshes in the past 10 years, and is yet to release a smartphone OS, 30
months after buying Danger.

The competitive interplay between Apple and Google will continue to help smartphone
software outpace PCs. But iOS and Android also benefit wildly from the structure of the
smartphone industry. Apple and Google are pushed not just by each other, but by the symbiotic
advancement in chipsets and the system integration work of component vendors that I detailed
above. The entire smartphone innovation value-chain just works.

It's this overall combination of component advancement, system integration, and software
which will continue to drive unprecedented innovation in mobile. Meanwhile, the WinTel
monopoly is taking PCs along a slow linear path, where features and user experience drag way
behind available technology.

As we approach the next evolution in computing as ushered in by the iPad, Microsoft and Intel
are under extraordinary pressure to recover in mobile. But not only do they lack the
technology to succeed, they also fall victim to the inbred structure they've created in the PC
industry. Itâ€™s very likely that within 5 years, tablets, smartphones, and other
â€œmobile devicesâ€� will have permanently left PC innovation behind. And I'd
argue this is a good thing for both the progression of exciting new technologies, and for
consumers. Tweet tags: Apple , Google , Intel , Software , mobile , 1 Comment

Why iPhone 4 Will Crush AT&T's Network

Business Insider Link

Last week during Steve Jobs’ interviews at D8 an audience member asked him about AT&T’s
network. iPhone users are deeply familiar with the issues—dead connections, dropped
calls, bad coverage, and intermittent data.

Everyone was wondering how Steve would answer. Using his masterful ability to demonstrate
empathy, Steve disarmed the audience almost immediately (see video ), replying that
AT&T’s best experts tell him “things should be getting a lot better soon – certainly by
the end of the summer”.

Contrary to Steve’s answer, AT&T’s issues are not primarily around spectrum or
backhaul. Instead, they center around ' signaling ', which smartphones rely on for polling,
status and control updates.

Ironically, as Jobs talked about a summer solution, we’re on the precipice of an event which
will likely make AT&T’s network dramatically WORSE very soon: iOS 4 multitasking.

This is because multitasking will increase signaling usage by 3-5x. Imagine streaming
Pandora, buying the song on iTunes while listening, receiving Twitter timeline updates and
updated World Cup scores, and checking in on Foursquare – simultaneously! Or exiting the
subway with 5 open apps and waiting while each establishes a new network connection. Without a
doubt this will bring AT&T’s signaling layer to its knees.

And no amount of additional spectrum or backhaul can solve signaling issues. The longer term
solution is re-architected LTE networks , but their deployment will take many years. Adding
femtocells is another solution, which is exactly why AT&T is the first carrier in the US to
aggressively push their use.

But here’s the fascinating point: the signaling issues aren’t just AT&T’s fault. In a
quest to extend battery life on the iPhone, Apple did something 'non-standard' which
compounds the issues – the iPhone constantly drops connections, going in to an idle state.
Keepalives within the apps then reestablish a new connection after only a few seconds.
Network equipment makers never anticipated this. Think of it as hanging up during a phone call
when the line is silent, and then redialing to respond.

Though RIM was doing this earlier than Apple, the iPhone is the first device to really push use
of idle disconnects, as Apple looked for every way to extend battery life. If Apple stopped
their use in iOS 4, technical experts almost universally agree that signaling problems would
subside. But it would also result in reduced iPhone battery life, which is why Apple won’t
agree to do so. Steve Jobs almost certainly knows this.

Perhaps most fascinating is that this problem is another testament to Apple’s marketing
muscle and ability to control partners and suppliers.

How so? AT&T knows full well about the signaling issues, but has been okay taking public blame,
even though the 'solution' is in the handsets just as much as the network. Psychologically
speaking AT&T and Apple know that people prefer to have one primary scapegoat. If instead AT&T
subscribers knew that their horrible service was in part due to Apple’s design choices ,
it’s likely they’d be less loyal. In exchange for its constant bashing, AT&T enjoys the
lowest subscriber churn in the industry.

So Steve Jobs is much smarter than his answer at D8 suggests. He knows that there is a pretty
simple solution to a complex problem—for Apple to roll back use of idle disconnects. But
this almost certainly won’t happen since for Apple it’s not a zero sum game – the entire
network would benefit, while Apple would lose its edge in battery life against Android. Which
is why your service is likely to continue getting worse for a long time to come, not better...

Itâ€™s almost scary how much power Apple seems to have these days. Heck, during the
Gizmodo iPhone 4G saga, they apparently even had control over the police !

One thing is sure â€“ Steve Jobs has been pretty serious about keeping power ever since
Apple lost the PC vs Mac war. So how is Apple trying to stop Android from stream-rolling over
them in mobile?

A lot of it has to do with securing and maintaining power over various mobile ecosystem
players. And hereâ€™s how Apple does that â€“ technically, strategically, and
psychologically.

Developers and Tools Vendors :

A LOT has been written about Apple eliminating cross compilers, which disallows write-once,
run-anywhere. Many claim this is just for capricious control or a hatred of Adobe â€“ but
Apple really did this for ecosystem independence.

The change to 3.3.1 was not about limiting developers per-say, but more about tools vendors
and ecosystem players. A great non-Adobe example of this is Java. Oracle recently bought Sun,
and is giving Java even less love in mobile than it had before.

Google, which uses its own Java virtual machine on Android, has been particularly vocal about
slow arrival of new J2ME versions and fragmentation of the code base. These problems
pre-dated Oracle, but will get worse â€“ Oracle cares about the enterprise, not mobile.

Not good for Google and they are freaking out. Apple doesnâ€™t care!

Processor Vendors (Intel, Qualcomm, nVidia, et al):

Below are two massive unspoken benefits afforded to Apple by control over development
languages and tools vendors.

1. Switching away from ARM . By mandating Objective-C / Xcode, Apple can effectively switch
architectures in secret and release a native machine language compiler right when a new
product is announced.

Normally, if a compute vendor switches architectures, cross compilers (the Adobes)
wonâ€™t compile down to native machine language even though in theory code is portable
between architectures.

Key to understanding this is recognizing Apple probably has no near-term intention of
switching. But they can switch, with zero disruption. This allows Apple to completely take
control away from processor vendors. Effectively, Apple has commoditized the CPU
â€”the most complex proprietary component in any computing device! This
strategically benefits Apple in a powerful wayâ€”even John Gruber agrees with me .

2. Architecturally enhancing ARM . Instead of switching, itâ€™s more likely Apple
remains with ARM, applying effort to instruction set architecture modifications to stay
ahead of competitors. PA Semi and Intrinsity talent will allow Apple to keep pushing the
envelope as a soft-core architectural licensee.

Of course, any non-standard changes to ARM would require a new optimized compiler. But by
disallowing cross compilers, Apple avoids the need to disclose changes to tools vendors in
advance. This is powerful.

Conversely, Apple would have had to share architecture changes so that 3rd party tools
vendors could have adequate time to add support. This would effectively reduce
Appleâ€™s head-start and give competitors a glimpse into platform changes many months
before release.

Itâ€™s pretty evident this level of strategic planning simply doesnâ€™t happen
in the corner office at other companies, and in Appleâ€™s case itâ€™s intimately
related to the fear of relinquishing power to others in the ecosystem.

Other Suppliers (Non-Processor):

Apple has brought key pieces of its design in-house in a strategy called vertical integration
. This allows Apple to concentrate its focus on a reduced set of the most important suppliers,
sometimes steering them and working more closely to align incentives. Companies that are
more horizontally integrated have to deal with tons more suppliers and simply canâ€™t
do this (e.g. Dell).

Vertical integration is a way for companies to move "up the stack" in the sense of leaping the
commodity layers to focus where the revenues are (often today this is in services or
transactions). Tangible benefits include speed, reduced input costs, and ability to
perfect the hardware/software interplay. All of these are really just proxies for
maximizing revenues.

Problem is it doesn't work well very often in real life. But the strategy is well-suited for
Apple because they make so few products, and their products are so successful, that
development resources are better focused and cost is amortized across many millions of
units.

So the philosophy of vertically integrating around fewer products results in fewer
suppliers, and actually allows Apple to partner better with its remaining suppliers. For
example, Skyhook wireless has a unique location technology which has advantages over GPS,
and word on the street is that Steve Jobs negotiated the contract directly even though Skyhook
is a small startup, even paying them fairly for the design.

The Department of Justice: Â 

This is partly meant to be humorous. But, from a strategy vantage-point, Iâ€™d argue
Apple is doing something fascinating â€“ by going after the high-end of the market,
Apple will likely avoid the level of anti-trust scrutiny that befell Microsoft and Intel. I
have to think this factors in to their strategy of having NOT released a 'low-end' $99 iPhone.

Even though Apple has more profit than any other handset maker, they still only have a small
portion of market volume . This affords them a level of implicit immunity from the control of
the DOJâ€”they can do things which would likely otherwise come under more intense
scrutiny. They are starting to attract some attention , but it would be much worse if they went
after the mid-range of the market.

So â€“ we are all aware of the control Apple exerts over the user experience. But behind
the scenes, Apple thinks deeply about supplier and ecosystem power on very nuanced and
strategic levels. And this list is not meant to be exhaustive. There are a litany of other ways
Apple exerts controls. I used to see some firsthand as a supplier.

In my opinion, it's this paranoia about control that will likely help Apple to maintain mobile
product leadership amidst unrelenting competition from Google and others... I don't think
it's going to be like Mac vs PC this time. Tweet tags: Apple , Google , Software , Strategy ,

Update: HP announced it is acquiring Palm for WebOS-based computing devices the same day I
wrote this.



We've all heard for a while now that Palmâ€™s most likely suitors are the off-continent
smartphone/ computer makers HTC and Lenovo. But thereâ€™s an overlooked potential
buyer who could be a dark horse to buy Palm: Cisco Systems.

Cisco has an unbelievable history in technology M&A, and has $25B in cash net of debt, trailing
only Apple and Microsoft within tech. But why would Cisco want Palm? Behind Cisco's
networking exterior is actually a software DNA. In fact, if you walk the halls at Cisco,
engineers will even boast â€œCisco is a software companyâ€�. Incredible,
considering Cisco sells networking gear.

But such generic software synergies would never be enough for Cisco to waste time with Palm
â€“ there are much more specific reasons why Palm would be strategic for Cisco today:

Cisco is rumored to be building an enterprise tablet computer, combining IP telephony,
video, WebEx & mobile collaboration .

All signs point to this making sense. Why should Cisco cede the enterprise market to Apple (and
Google, HP)? Cisco actually touted WebEx on the iPad on day 1, and it's very clear they believe
that a portable form factor will succeed in the enterprise â€“ marrying collaboration,
video (two of Ciscoâ€™s â€˜ four pillars â€™) hybrid cloud apps, and
mobility.

But unfortunately for Cisco, they don't have a web-centric, mobile optimized platform OS.
Their networking operating system ' IOS ' is way too bloated for mobile app-centric
appliances. And though the Linksys consumer line uses embedded Linux, it's fragmented
across chip vendors/ODMs and lacks platform richness.

This leaves Cisco three options: make, buy, or license. Creating a new platform is infeasible
based on time constraints. What about licensing Android? Maybe â€“ but Cisco dislikes
licensing core IP, and they would then be partially reliant on Google , whom they are
increasingly competing with (collaboration, IP telephony, STB markets).

Enter Palm. WebOS would be an unbelievable platform on which Cisco could build a feature-rich
enterprise tablet, while still controlling the platform and OS. Beyond a tablet,Â  Palm's
software expertise could be shared across Ciscoâ€™s 20+ business units. IP and patents
could help Scientific Atlanta build web-friendly set top boxes, and the mobile platform fits
with the future of the Flip line of HD cameras. Non-technology synergies also exist â€“
e.g. Ciscoâ€™s VP of Consumer Marketing Ken Wirt is ex-Palm.

Despite all these synergies, Palm indeed comes with a lot of baggage. Cisco heartburn would
likely center around what other buyers actually want â€“ the handset business. I doubt
Cisco has any interest in competing against Android, RIM, iPhone et al while losing money
(though I could be wrong â€“ Cisco is #1 in enterprise VoIP phones, and has great
relationships with AT&T and Verizon).

These worries can't be trivial, but even still, Cisco has been known to throw around big money
just for IP and employees (e.g. Procket , whom they bought for almost $100M and shut down). So it
would not be shocking for Cisco to purchase Palm, cut SG&A, let carrier relationship dry out,
cease new platform development, and allow the Pre/Pixi to slowly play out.

Buying Palm would also be dilutive to Ciscoâ€™s earnings, and this is generally a no-no
from Wall Streetâ€™s perspective. But explaining Palm as a strategic imperative for a
collaboration-rich, WebEx-centric enterprise tablet would surely appease the street.
Which is why I believe Cisco is watching the Palm death-watch play out, and will pounce if the
price is right.

What is 'ARM Holdings' Anyway?

There is so much confusion around the small Cambridge UK company named â€˜ ARM Holdings
â€™â€“ which had close to zero mainstream press prior to Apple building
itâ€™s A4 processor. ARM has always been known in tech circles, but now that itâ€™s
associated with consumer technology (because of Apple), I must say that almost every article
I read about the company makes erroneous statements.

This is swelling over today because of the rumor that Apple may buy ARM. The misinformation is
to the point that people are claiming Apple should buy Qualcomm instead of ARM, because the two
are competitors â€“ honestly this needs to stop. I thought I would write a quick post on
what ARM does (and doesnâ€™t do).

Business:

ARM does NOT â€œmakeâ€� or sell turnkey processors. What they do is control the
instruction set architecture of ARM (more on that below), and license â€œcoresâ€�
to vendors. When a vendor manufactures its own processor, ARM gets a very tiny cut of the
revenue off each sale (2009 revenue was only $500M).

Processor licensing is done in 2 ways:

1)Â Â Â  Hard-core - the route most ARM licensees go. Vendors "drop in" a processor
core like the Cortex A8 , and build support logic around it, e.g. input/output peripheral and
memory controller logic. ARM has literally hundreds of licensees who do this.Â  Designing
embedded SoC processors is not easy, but availability of hard-cores makes it much easier.

2)Â Â Â  Soft-core - there are a few ARM licensees who customize the architecture
further. Think of this as buying the basic blueprint, but then making your own tweaks to make it
even better. This comes with a lot of increased responsibility and work. Ironically, Intel
used to be a licensee and sold a variant of ARM (XScale) before they quit and dumped it! It's also
thought that Apple negotiated this type of license with ARM just after buying PA Semi, even
though the iPad uses a hard-core Cortex A8.

Note for comparison sake that Intel does NOT license its architecture.



Technical:

ARM is a low power highly efficient RISC (reduced instruction set computer) architecture. By
comparison, Intel x86 is known as CISC (complex instruction set computer). ARM is not the only
RISC architecture â€“ there is also MIPS , SPARC, PowerPC (formerly used in Macs), and
others. Â Intelâ€™s x86 is the only high profile CISC architecture.

CISC/x86 is comprised of hundreds of instructions (individual commands) at the machine code
level (assembly language). RISC-based CPUs (ARM) use much fewer instructions â€“ only
dozens.

There are all kinds of business and technical reasons why ARM is â€œbetterâ€� for
the mobile market. Here is probably the biggest technical reason:

RISC instructions are fixed-length, while CISC instructions vary in length. This means that
the fetch/decode process for RISC is more efficient (better use of memory resources etc). The
results in a more efficient â€œpipelineâ€�, which means lower power consumption
and better battery life.

ARM in relation to Apple and Intel:

It makes more sense for Apple to join the â€œsoft coreâ€� license group (and
itâ€™s rumored they already have) than to buy ARM. Buying ARM would not give Apple much of
anything other than heartburn on what to do with the hundreds of licensees. Apple can already
make a modified processor â€œsoft coreâ€� and tweak the ARM instruction set, as
well as use custom cell logic to do things like power and clock gating (to increase performance
per watt of power consumption).

It would make more sense for Intel to buy ARM (from Intelâ€™s standpoint). But this would
be an anti-trust case in the making due to past monopolistic behavior and anti-competitive
business practices. It would also be absolutely horrible for innovation so letâ€™s
hope it never happens. I personally think it could happen, but only after Intel is severely
weakened by the mobile revolution and fails to gain traction with its Atom CPUs (say in 5
years). Read this for more on why Intel lost the iPad and has zero share in mobile.

The Genius in Apple's Vertical Platform

Itâ€™s pretty evident that Apple isnâ€™t wed to individual suppliers. Not only
are they back to creating their own chips, but they are also one of the only 'compute' companies
to have used each of the top 3 processor architectures over timeâ€”ARM, x86, and Power
PC.

Apple's DNA in this area is untouchable, helping it to innovate at the confluence of software
and hardware . Thereâ€™s a reason why pinching and zooming on the iPad is snappier than
anything people have ever seen, and itâ€™s not entirely clear whether the software or
hardware plays the larger part.

When a company decides to vertically integrate, as Apple has done with the iPad, it becomes
subject to incredible pressure from outside. For example, how can Apple possibly stay ahead
of the entire semiconductor universe, which will sell many more times volume than the iPhone
and iPad.

Appleâ€™s commitment to vertically integrate comes with a pressure to accommodate
changeâ€”they simply canâ€™t commit to one architecture for the long-haul. But
changing puts strain on developers, since code must be recompiled and cross-compilers
rarely maintain performance.Â 

This week Apple confined developers to a specific set of tools ( XCode ). A lot of people think
this is to kill Adobe Flash . Sure, that is a tactical reason, but there are much broader
strategic reasons. By telling developers to move to XCode tools, Apple is setting the stage to
potentially switch architectures .Â 

History often repeats itself: In 2003, Apple advised developers to switch to XCode tools.
This was not a coincidental moveâ€”2 years later Apple moved to Intel across its entire
Mac line. Developers who complied could simply press a button and applications would run
natively (full performance) on new Intel Macs.

Now consider this - Apple may have already switched without people knowing. Hereâ€™s an
anecdote -Â  the innards of Appleâ€™s A4 (powers the iPad) have been speculated ad
nauseum by experts, but the reality is no one knows whatâ€™s actually inside. This week,
there was very surprising analysis that the A4â€™s die size far exceeds what it 'should'
be (single core ARM Cortex A8 with a 64 bit memory bus and GPU).

This analysis is not yet mainstream, but will add tremendous fuel to the fire that perhaps the
A4 is NOT an ARM architecture. In fact, itâ€™s highly possible that the A4 is a dual core
Power Architecture, which is what the PA Semi team worked with, prior to Apple buying them in
2007.

If this is indeed the case, then iPhone OS 4.0 would bring incredible speed improvements to the
iPad , since it would no longer run applications on an ARM processor emulator. Can you imagine
if OS 4.0 improved the iPadâ€™s speed by 50% on day 1? Apple would be heralded as a software
God. But in order for these speed improvements to be realized, apps would need to be written in
objective Câ€”which is exactly what Apple is now telling developers to do.

Itâ€™s clear from a strategic perspective that Apple has thought about vertical
integration incredibly deeply. Their choice to enter the CPU business was not made lightly,
and reflects a platform heritage and an ability to steer developers (afforded by huge network
effects). We will likely find out what's really inside the A4 soon. But one thing is already
clear:Â  Apple is sowing the groundwork to make architecture changes seamless â€”
developers will only need to flip a switch to give their apps blazing, native performance .

This incredible foresight will allow Apple to stay agile and maneuver in the face of what will
be unrelenting competition from Intel , Qualcomm, and nVidia. Apple can essentially treat
the CPU as a commodity â€”and this will enable them to continually adjust 'make vs buy'
strategies, wield incredible power over suppliers, and build a long-term halo around their
platform.Â 

I find it fascinating that Apple has been so good at diverting attention to the Flash argument,
that people donâ€™t see the true genius behind Steve Jobâ€™s vision and moves.
Apple is setting the stage to become one of the biggest winners in the storied history of
vertically integrated companies .

Apple the Platform Company

Over the past 10 years, systems companies have trended away from chip development for two
simple reasons: 1) design and fabrication costs - too expensive unless amortized across huge
volumes  2) semiconductors are a saturated market (lots of “merchant” chip players
fighting for business).

In 2007 we saw an example of this play out in mobile, when   Nokia divested its chip designers
and wireless IP to STMicro. Ironically, Apple then moved in the opposite direction by buying a
chip company (PA Semi).

Why would Apple do this? (effectively deciding to compete against the world’s top chip
makers – Intel, Qualcomm, TI, Infineon, etc). Let’s analyze in the context of hardware,
software, platform control, buyer/seller bargaining power, and marketing.

Hardware : Apple is celebrated for its minimalistic approach to hardware design. This runs
contrary to the incentives of chip companies, who benefit from a “kitchen sink” approach
– i.e. integrating every conceivable feature so as to sell to as many customers as
possible.  By designing its own chips, Apple avoids paying for unused silicon (saves chip
size, cost & power). They can also optimize for their minimum feature set (e.g. video at 720p vs
1080p) and focus on custom cell logic which maximizes performance per watt.



Software : a BIG potential win for Apple and here’s why: As SoCs (system-on-chips)
increasingly go multicore, hardware companies face stiff parallel software challenges .
 It will take years for software to adapt to dual-core models, and until it does, there will
only be a ~30-40% gain in performance from offloading background tasks to the second CPU core,
versus a theoretical improvement of 100%. Why the big difference? Only the best programmers
understand parallel-compute structures. Apple can wield tremendous advantage here by
having its own chip and software guys collaborate – Apple pioneered parallel software
efforts in GCD and OpenCL .

Platform Control :  Key to Apple’s platform strategy is control. By owning its own chips,
Apple can put in special hooks so people can’t access hardware internals – e.g. they can
design more fool-proof DRM to instill confidence for Hollywood, and they can tighten
security holes to keep out jailbreakers/hackers. If they use outside chip vendors, they
can’t fully control these aspects of their platform.

Buyer / Seller Bargaining Power :  Seller and buyer power are largely driven by a company’s
market share. As Apple’s share increases in mobile they wield unbelievable power over
suppliers. Component vendors are falling over themselves to get inside iPhone/iPad (I wrote
about Intel here ). Apple’s agreement with Samsung (Fab partner for A4) allows it to benefit
from massive scale (Samsung is #2 chip-maker worldwide), get quick-turns, test chips, and
best pricing. Samsung does this because Apple will continue to buy flash memory in massive
volumes (so this ultimately ties back to platform halo effect).  Since A4 is ARM-based
(ubiquitous in mobile), Apple avoids any peril of building a platform around a
proprietary/unpopular architecture (e.g. the 90's battle of Mac/PowerPC vs
PCs/Intel).  



Marketing : Steve Jobs made it no secret in calling out Apple’s A4 by name during the iPad
launch. Why did he do this? (unusual for Apple to advertise the “guts” of a product).
Answer is simple – Apple wants consumers to believe that by building its own chips, its
products will have a noticeable edge in performance and battery life against the
competition. This is subtle but very important. Advertise it, the Apple fanboys will write
about it, and consumers will pay extra.

So the move to vertically integrate chip development helps Apple erect barriers and become a
dominant platform company . This spells a larger trend – it is no longer adequate to simply be
a device or software company to succeed.

Why Intel is Sinking in Mobile (w/ Microsoft)

A lot is made of Microsoft’s failures in the mobile market (and for good reason). Equally
interesting –  but discussed much less – is how the mobile computing revolution is
disrupting Intel.

I previously discussed how processing chips designed for mobile and PCs are converging . This
can be proven simply by looking at Apple’s new A4 processor , which seems destined to reside
in this year’s refreshed iPhone, but will first surface in the iPad tablet.

Intel currently dominates PCs, supplying microprocessors to 80% of the market. However, in
wireless / mobile, Intel has zero market share . In fact they exited the market in 2006, after
realizing that supplier fragmentation and lack of wireless domain expertise had
marginalized their traditional advantages (process technology, manufacturing scale,
etc)

Mobile CPU architecture is instead dominated by a company named ARM, which licenses
processors to 95% of cell phones worldwide. Despite ARM’s dominance, it’s fascinating
to note they are a essentially a zero billion dollar business *, to use a term coined  by Fred
Wilson. This isn’t entirely true since ARM only licenses the core technology (other
suppliers build chips based off ARM) but it’s an indication of how commoditization and
“open” architecture increase competition and compress prices in horizontally
integrated markets.

Though Intel has zero share in mobile today they want in badly .  Their new line of Atom chips
has been a success in netbooks, selling $1.4B in 2009, and they are shrinking it for
smartphones. However – by failing to see that mobile computing would quickly converge with
PCs –  Intel missed a major inflection point in the evolution of the industry (again it’s
Microsoft and Nokia who are publicly berated the most for this miss, while Intel is rarely
mentioned).

Today, Intel knows that its mobile future rests on whether Atom (originally repurposed from
Intel’s x86 / PC line) can penetrate handsets and other portable devices. This seems
unlikely and here’s why: “breakthrough” tablet / mobile computers (the iPad) are
based around a mobile architecture (not a Windows PC disguised as a tablet).

Furthermore, the emergence of Google’s Chrome OS will bring Google Apps and cloud
computing to mainstream users in 2010. Netbooks based on Chrome will obviate the need for
local storage and create a stronger divergence from PCs. The lack of Windows will make it more
difficult for Intel to pressure suppliers to use its chips (this was often referred to as the
“ WinTel ” alliance)

Intel’s leverage at Apple has already eroded. They made extremely aggressive efforts to
penetrate the iPad with Atom and failed (think bundled pricing, roadmap alignment etc). 
Few people know Intel has a dedicated Apple sales team .  This isn’t simply a “team”
which rolls up to sales, but a group of ~40 people which walls itself off from the rest of Intel,
and caters to Apple’s demands for total secrecy(!)  No other OEM garners this level of
attention from Intel (Dell, HP, etc.)

Despite this fact, and the de facto position that Intel has on iMac and Macbook, Intel failed to
penetrate the iPhone and the iPad. In fact they have zero content on either device . To put this
into context – the world’s largest semiconductor supplier came up with a goose egg on
Apple’s mobile products, despite owning the Mac line and pouring incredible resources in
to a chip architected specifically for the market.

Intel’s miss at Apple is endemic of their failure to see how mobile devices would forcefully
disrupt desktop computing.  Just as Microsoft, Nokia and others failed. New winners have
emerged in hardware, software, and the same is happening in chips. It’s just a matter of
time...

 

* ARM had 2009 revenue of $490M, making it a “zero billion dollar” business". In contrast,
Intel’s 2009 revenue was approximately $35B (70x greater). See Fred Wilson ’s write-up
on Craigslist / newspaper classifieds for full background. Tweet tags: Apple , Google , Intel

I love teaching and coaching, and occasionally I teach the GMAT to prospective b-schoolers.
Recently I went into the iTunes app store to check whether any GMAT specific apps existed.
Here’s what I found:

o         About 30 GMAT apps – most sketchy. A few free, most sub $5, one for $20

o         Only reputable company is Veritas. Their app is free.

o         Guess who’s missing... Kaplan, Princeton Review, Manhattan GMAT ,
Knewton

ALL of the major test prep firms missing. In 2010. Even Knewton, which is a super innovative
company and a model for web-based education. Knewton could have an incredible app tying in to
their user accounts. They already deliver 100% of their curriculum via the internet.  They
could push new sets of problems based on the user profile... the possibilities are endless.

In order to progress, education must proliferate into our everyday lives. Our everyday lives
are increasingly based around mobile technology. As a user, if I read the NYTimes app on the
subway, I’d be very likely to spend a 15 minute commute doing GMAT problems.

The average prospective b-schooler is around 25 years old. This is the “tech crowd”. I am
confident WAY over half of this demographic own a smart-phone – iPhones and blackberries in
particular.  In New York it’s basically 100%.

Clearly it’s not an economic decision for these companies? Their content is ready to go.
Hiring an app developer to create a good user interface would cost peanuts. Do the apps need to
make sense economically (from a sales perspective)? Not really – this is all about creating
a better customer experience and differentiating (test prep is a hyper competitive space).
Strategically, this should be a tool to build the business.

So why is it that education related companies lag so far behind when it comes to technology
adoption? Where are the Kaplans of the world? I believe it’s a relative discomfort with
technology combined with a real glacial approach to change and innovation. Technology and
education disciplines historically haven’t mixed, and it’s rare for employees of these
companies to have domain knowledge in both.  I see this changing in the years ahead.

Btw this post is confined to a narrow test prep discussion but is meant to be more provocative
about education at-large.



It will be interesting to see how the iPad impacts the education vertical. As a consumption
platform, the device is perfect for dynamic content.  It’s not unreasonable to consider a
case 5 years out (3?) where every college student is given an iPad-like device or is forced to
buy one.  The *hundreds* of dollars I used to spend on lugging around textbooks would be
history. E-books would net a huge savings. 

Back to the GMAT, I checked out a few of the apps, and pasted a screen shot from one of them at top. I
don’t even want to name the app because I don’t want to embarrass them and I think they mean
well (I sure am a sucker for education) but the content was pretty bad.

One of the questions was to find the perimeter of a polygon – see top picture. All of the sides
were labeled. I am sorry but anyone in 3rd grade can add the 4 numbers in the diagram to get 33!
...this is NOT a GMAT problem and the app serves very little purpose to anyone, especially at
$9.99

Hey Knewton and Manhattan GMAT ( now part of Kaplan ) – mobile is yours to own, go
