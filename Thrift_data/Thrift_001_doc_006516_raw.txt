ufo

LONDON - An American fighter pilot flying from an English air base at the height of the Cold War
was ordered to open fire on a massive UFO that lit up his radar, according to an account
published by Britain's National Archives on Monday.

The fighter pilot said he was ordered to fire a full salvo of rockets at the UFO moving
erratically over the North Sea _ but that at the last minute the object picked up enormous speed
and disappeared. The account, first published in Britain's Daily Star newspaper more than 17
years ago and to this day unverified by military authorities, was one of many carried in the
1,500 pages the archives made available online.

The unnamed pilot said he and another airman were scrambled on the night of May 20, 1957 to
intercept an unusual "bogey" on radars at a Royal Air Force Station Manston, an airfield at the
southeastern tip of England about 75 miles from central London.

"This was a flying object with very unusual flight patterns," the pilot said, according to a
typed manuscript of his account mailed to Britain's Ministry of Defense by a UFO enthusiast in
1988. "In the initial briefing it was suggested to us that the bogey actually was motionless
for long intervals."

Ordered to fly at full throttle in cloudy weather, the pilot said he was given the order to fire a
volley of 24 rockets at the mysterious object.

"To be quite candid I almost (expletive) my pants!" the pilot said, saying he asked for
confirmation _ which he received.

Retired U.S. airman Milton Torres told Britain's Sky News on Monday that he was the pilot and
has spent 50 frustrating years attempting to uncover the truth of his mid-air encounter.

Speaking from his home in Miami, Florida, Torres said he never saw the UFO with his naked eye,
but watched in awe as it appeared on his jet's radar and sped off before he had chance to fire.

"All of a sudden as it was coming in, it decided to take off and leave me behind ... The next thing I
know it was gone," Torres told Sky News. "It was some kind of space alien craft. It was so fast, it
was so incredible ... it was absolutely death defying."

In the newly published government file, the U.S. airman said the UFO appeared impossible to
miss.

"The blip was burning a hole in the radar with its incredible intensity," the pilot said. "It
was similar to a blip I had received from B-52's and seemed to be a magnet of light. ... I had a lock
on that had the proportions of a flying aircraft carrier."

As he closed in on the object to prepare for combat, however, the object began to move wildly
before fading off his radar. The target gone, the mission was called off, and he returned to
base to an odd reception.

"I had not the foggiest idea what had actually occurred, nor would anyone explain anything to
me," the pilot said. He said he was led to a man in civilian clothes, who "advised me that this
would be considered highly classified and that I should not discuss it with anybody not even my
commander."

"He disappeared without so much as a goodbye and that was that, as far as I was concerned," the
pilot said, according to the account.

Britain's military said it had no record of the incident, according to the files. Neither did
the U.S. military. The second pilot's account, also included in the files, paints a somewhat
different picture of events, saying there were not one but several "unknowns" and that he did
not remember being contacted by anyone about staying quiet. He did not mention the targets'
size.

"I know this is not a very exciting narrative but it is all I can recall," the second pilot said.

His name, like his colleague's, was redacted from the files.

David Clarke, a UFO expert who has worked with the National Archives on the document release,
said it was one of the most intriguing stories he had culled from the batch of files released
Monday.

He said that the CIA once had a program intended to create phantom signals on radar _ and that
this may have been an exercise in electronic warfare. Whatever the case, Clarke argued that
"there's no doubt something very unusual happened."

Clarke said the batch of files released Monday _ which include witness accounts,
investigations, and sketches _ was part of a three to four year program intended to make a total
of 160 UFO-related files available to the public. Posted by

At first, there was only Nun. Nun was the dark waters of chaos . One day, a hill rose up out of the
waters. This hill was called Ben-Ben.

Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/atum.gif

On this hill stood Atum, the first god.

Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/shu.gif

Atum coughed and spat out Shu, the god of the air, and Tefnut, the goddess of moisture.

Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/shu.gif



Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/geb.gif

Shu and Tefnut had two children. First, there was Geb, the god of the earth. Then, there was Nut,
the goddess of the sky.

Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/nut.gif

Shu lifted Nut up so that she became a canopy over Geb.

Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/osissene.gif

Nut and Geb had four children named Osiris, Isis, Seth and Nephthys.

Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/fadens.gif

Osiris was the king of the earth and Isis was the queen. Osiris was a good king, and he ruled over
the earth for many years.

Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/kill.gif

However, everything was not well. Seth was jealous of Osiris because he wanted to be the ruler
of the earth. He grew angrier and angrier until one day he killed Osiris.

Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/underw.gif

Osiris went down into the underworld and Seth remained on earth and became king.

Image: http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/story/images/horus.gif

Osiris and Isis had one son called Horus. Horus battled against Seth and regained the throne.

After that, Horus was the king of the earth and Osiris was the king of the underworld. The End

    town and want a couple of tickets to a Diamondbacks game, the front office can usually
    scare up some decent seats.

    

    3 - Morton's Steakhouse, Scottsdale. Big hunks of meat. Very popular. You almost have to
    be famous to get a reservation.

    

    4 - The Arizona Biltmore. If money is no object, here's one of the finest resorts in the area
    . The rich and famous often lounge around here. Other resorts that famous people enjoy are
    the Phoenician and the Boulders.

    

    5 - Rolf's Salon. If you think this place just cuts hair, you're mistaken. A person (male or
    female) could spend all day there getting pampered. Some of the rich and famous do just
    that!

    

    6 - There are some public golf courses in the area where you are more likely to come across
    famous people, although many of them will play at private clubs.

    

    7 - US Airways Center (formerly the America West Arena), seats on the floor. See Chase
    Field, above. Same concept, taller people playing a different sport.

    

    8 - Cooper'stown , downtown Phoenix. Alice Cooper is a local resident (and a darn good
    golfer) and opened this hot bar/eatery downtown. Maherle's, downtown Phoenix.

    

    9 - On the north end of town you'll find athletes and some other notables at the Fox Sports
    Grill. From time to time they interview famous folks and broadcast from there.

    

    10 - The Borgata , Scottsdale. Step into Italy when you enter this shopping area with
    exclusive stores.

    

    11 - AJ's Fine Foods, Gourmet Grocery. Need some caviar, imported cheese or that special
    wine? Even famous people need to buy the basics. . . .

    

    12 - The Ritz-Carlton in Phoenix, at 24th Street and Camelback, is known for hosting many
    local athletes and bands that come to town. It is common to find people sitting on the
    concrete wall across from the valet parking, waiting for an opportunity for an
    autograph.

    

    13 - The Barrett-Jackson Classic Car Auction . Every January you can hob-nob with people
    who bid on classic and expensive cars.

    

    14 - The Phoenix area is not known for its night clubs or night life, but if the rich and
    famous are looking for a place where they can dress up and go out, Axis/Radius is a "two
    clubs in one" spot in Scottsdale that might very well be the place.

    

    15 - During the month of March baseball autograph hounds are everywhere around town for
    Spring Training Baseball , where you can get up close to the players at practices and at the
    games.

    



Tips:

    

    1 - When seeing a famous person, try not to be a pest, particularly if he/she is with family
    or engrossed in conversation. Try to make eye contact. If you get some favorable sign, ask
    for an autograph, say thanks, and quietly leave.

    

    2 - If you are lucky enough to be playing golf with a famous person, be gracious if they
    cheat, uh, I mean, make a mistake.

Animals

[ edit ] Etymology

The word "animal" comes from the Latin word animale, neuter of animalis, and is derived from
anima, meaning vital breath or soul. In everyday colloquial usage, the word usually refers to
non- human animals. The biological definition of the word refers to all members of the Kingdom
Animalia. Therefore, when the word "animal" is used in a biological context, humans are
included. [1]



[ edit ] Characteristics

Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things. Animals
are eukaryotic and usually multicellular [2] (although see Myxozoa ), which separates them
from bacteria and most protists . They are heterotrophic , [3] generally digesting food in an
internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae . They are also distinguished
from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls . [4] All animals are motile, [5] if only at
certain life stages. In most animals, embryos pass through a blastula stage , which is a
characteristic exclusive to animals.



[ edit ] Structure

With a few exceptions, most notably the sponges (Phylum Porifera) and Placozoa, animals have
bodies differentiated into separate tissues . These include muscles , which are able to
contract and control locomotion, and nerve tissue , which sends and processes signals. There
is also typically an internal digestive chamber, with one or two openings. Animals with this
sort of organization are called metazoans, or eumetazoans when the former is used for animals
in general.

All animals have eukaryotic cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix
composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins . This may be calcified to form structures
like shells , bones , and spicules . During development it forms a relatively flexible
framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized, making complex structures
possible. In contrast, other multicellular organisms like plants and fungi have cells held
in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Also, unique to animal cells are
the following intercellular junctions: tight junctions , gap junctions , and desmosomes .



[ edit ] Reproduction and development

Nearly all animals undergo some form of sexual reproduction. Adults are diploid or polyploid
. They have a few specialized reproductive cells, which undergo meiosis to produce smaller
motile spermatozoa or larger non-motile ova . These fuse to form zygotes , which develop into
new individuals.

anaphase .

Many animals are also capable of asexual reproduction . This may take place through
parthenogenesis , where fertile eggs are produced without mating, or in some cases through
fragmentation .

A zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere, called a blastula , which undergoes
rearrangement and differentiation. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and
develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated
rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber, and two
separate germ layers - an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm . In most cases, a
mesoderm also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues
and organs.

All animals grow by indirectly using the energy of sunlight . Plants use this energy to convert
sunlight into simple sugars using a process known as photosynthesis . Starting with the
molecules carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), photosynthesis converts the energy of
sunlight into chemical energy stored in the bonds of glucose (C6H12O6) and releases oxygen
(O2). These sugars are then used as the building blocks which allow the plant to grow. When
animals eat these plants (or eat other animals which have eaten plants), the sugars produced
by the plant are used by the animal. They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or
broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for
motion. This process is known as glycolysis .

Animals who live close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the ocean floor are not
dependent on the energy of sunlight. Instead, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria form the
base of the food chain.



[ edit ] Origin and fossil record

Animals are generally considered to have evolved from a flagellated eukaryote. Their
closest known living relatives are the choanoflagellates , collared flagellates that have a
morphology similar to the choanocytes of certain sponges. Molecular studies place animals
in a supergroup called the opisthokonts , which also include the choanoflagellates, fungi
and a few small parasitic protists . The name comes from the posterior location of the
flagellum in motile cells, such as most animal spermatozoa, whereas other eukaryotes tend to
have anterior flagella.

The first fossils that might represent animals appear towards the end of the Precambrian ,
around 610 million years ago, and are known as the Ediacaran or Vendian biota . These are
difficult to relate to later fossils, however. Some may represent precursors of modern
phyla, but they may be separate groups, and it is possible they are not really animals at all.
Aside from them, most known animal phyla make a more or less simultaneous appearance during
the Cambrian period, about 542 million years ago. It is still disputed whether this event,
called the Cambrian explosion , represents a rapid divergence between different groups or a
change in conditions that made fossilization possible. However some paleontologists and
geologists would suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought,
possibly even as early as 1 billion years ago. Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in
Tonian era strata in India indicate the presence of triploblastic worm like metazoans
roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms . [6] In addition during the
beginning of the Tonian period around 1 billion years ago (roughly the same time that the trace
fossils previously discussed in this article date back to) there was a decrease in
Stromatolite diversity which may indicate the appearance of grazing animals during this
time as Stromatolites also increased in diversity shortly after the end-Ordovician and
end-Permian rendered large amounts of grazing marine animals extinct and decreased shortly
after their populations recovered. However some other scientists doubt that these fossils
are authentic and have suggested these trace fossils are just the result of natural processes
such as erosion.[ citation needed ]



[ edit ] Groups of animals

a sea fan , Iciligorgia schrammi, and a sea rod, Plexaurella nutans.

The sponges ( Porifera ) were long thought to have diverged from other animals early. As
mentioned above, they lack the complex organization found in most other phyla. Their cells
are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into distinct tissues. Sponges are
sessile and typically feed by drawing in water through pores. Archaeocyatha , which have
fused skeletons, may represent sponges or a separate phylum. However, a phylogenomic study
in 2008 of 150 genes in 21 genera [7] revealed that it is the Ctenophora or comb jellies which are
the basal lineage of animals, at least among those 21 phyla. The authors speculate that
sponges—or at least those lines of sponges they investigated—are not so primitive, but
may instead be secondarily simplified.

Among the other phyla, the Ctenophora and the Cnidaria , which includes sea anemones , corals ,
and jellyfish , are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening,
which serves as both the mouth and the anus. Both have distinct tissues, but they are not
organized into organs . There are only two main germ layers, the ectoderm and endoderm, with
only scattered cells between them. As such, these animals are sometimes called diploblastic
. The tiny Placozoans are similar, but they do not have a permanent digestive chamber.

The remaining animals form a monophyletic group called the Bilateria . For the most part, they
are bilaterally symmetric, and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory
organs. The body is triploblastic , i.e. all three germ layers are well-developed, and
tissues form distinct organs. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and
there is also an internal body cavity called a coelom or pseudocoelom. There are exceptions to
each of these characteristics, however - for instance adult echinoderms are radially
symmetric, and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.

Genetic studies have considerably changed our understanding of the relationships within
the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages: the Deuterostomes and
Protostomes , which includes the Ecdysozoa , Platyzoa , and Lophotrochozoa . In addition,
there are a few small groups of bilaterians with relatively similar structure that appear to
have diverged before these major groups. These include the Acoelomorpha , Rhombozoa , and
Orthonectida . The Myxozoa , single-celled parasites that were originally considered
Protozoa, are now believed to have developed from the Bilateria as well.



[ edit ] Deuterostomes



Superb Fairy-wren , Malurus cyaneus

Deuterostomes differ from the other Bilateria, called protostomes , in several ways. In both
cases there is a complete digestive tract. However, in protostomes the initial opening (the
archenteron ) develops into the mouth, and an anus forms separately. In deuterostomes this is
reversed. In most protostomes, cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the
mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes it forms through
invagination of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching. Deuterostomes also have a
dorsal, rather than a ventral, nerve chord and their embryos undergo different cleavage.

All this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages.
The main phyla of deuterostomes are the Echinodermata and Chordata . The former are radially
symmetric and exclusively marine, such as starfish , sea urchins , and sea cucumbers . The
latter are dominated by the vertebrates , animals with backbones. These include fish ,
amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals .

In addition to these, the deuterostomes also include the Hemichordata or acorn worms.
Although they are not especially prominent today, the important fossil graptolites may
belong to this group.

The Chaetognatha or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes, but more recent studies suggest
protostome affinities.



[ edit ] Ecdysozoa



Yellow-winged Darter , Sympetrum flaveolum

The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, named after the common trait of growth by moulting or ecdysis .
The largest animal phylum belongs here, the Arthropoda , including insects , spiders , crabs ,
and their kin. All these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically
with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada , are close
relatives of the arthropods and share these traits.

The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, the second largest animal phylum.
Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is
water. A number are important parasites. Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha
or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha , Priapulida , and Loricifera . These groups have a
reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.

The remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes grouped together as the Spiralia ,
since in both embryos develop with spiral cleavage.



[ edit ] Platyzoa



Bedford's flatworm , Pseudobiceros bedfordi

The Platyzoa include the phylum Platyhelminthes , the flatworms. These were originally
considered some of the most primitive Bilateria, but it now appears they developed from more
complex ancestors. [8]

A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the flukes and tapeworms . Flatworms
are acoelomates , lacking a body cavity, as are their closest relatives, the microscopic
Gastrotricha . [9]

The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate . The most prominent
are the Rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aqueous environments. They also include the
Acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms, the Gnathostomulida , Micrognathozoa , and possibly
the Cycliophora . [10] These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are
called the Gnathifera .



[ edit ] Lophotrochozoa



Roman snail , Helix pomatia

The Lophotrochozoa include two of the most successful animal phyla, the Mollusca and
Annelida . [11] [12] The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum, includes animals
such as snails , clams , and squids , and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as
earthworms and leeches . These two groups have long been considered close relatives because
of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the
arthropods, [13] because they are both segmented. Now this is generally considered
convergent evolution , owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two
phyla. [14]

The Lophotrochozoa also include the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula , and several
phyla that have a fan of cilia around the mouth, called a lophophore . [15] These were
traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. [16] but it now appears they are
paraphyletic , [17] some closer to the Nemertea and some to the Mollusca and Annelida. [18]
[19] They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record,
the Entoprocta , the Phoronida , and possibly the Bryozoa or moss animals. [20]



[ edit ] Model organisms

Main articles: Model organism and Animal testing

Because of the great diversity found in animals, it is more economical for scientists to study
a small number of chosen species so that connections can be drawn from their work and
conclusions extrapolated about how animals function in general. Because they are easy to
keep and breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans have long been the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms , and were among
the first lifeforms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely
reduced state of their genomes , but the double-edged sword here is that with many genes ,
introns and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans can teach us little about the origins of animals
in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the superphylum will be revealed by the
crustacean, annelid, and molluscan genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the
starlet sea anemone genome has emphasised the importance of sponges, placozoans, and
choanoflagellates , also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes
unique to the Eumetazoa. [21]

An analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela also suggests that the last
common ancestor of sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously
assumed. [22]

Other model organisms belonging to the animal kingdom include the mouse ( Mus musculus ) and
zebrafish ( Danio rerio }.



[ edit ] History of classification



Carolus Linnaeus known as the father of modern taxonomy

Aristotle divided the living world between animals and plants , and this was followed by
Carolus Linnaeus (Carl von LinnÃ©), in the first hierarchical classification. Since then
biologists have begun emphasizing evolutionary relationships, and so these groups have
been restricted somewhat. For instance, microscopic protozoa were originally considered
animals because they move, but are now treated separately.

In Linnaeus 's original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the
classes of Vermes , Insecta , Pisces , Amphibia , Aves , and Mammalia . Since then the last four
have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata , whereas the various other forms
have been separated out. The above lists represent our current understanding of the group,
though there is some variation from source to source.

Animals who live close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the ocean floor are not
dependent on the energy of sunlight. Instead, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria form the
base of the food chain.



[ edit ] Origin and fossil record

Animals are generally considered to have evolved from a flagellated eukaryote. Their
closest known living relatives are the choanoflagellates , collared flagellates that have a
morphology similar to the choanocytes of certain sponges. Molecular studies place animals
in a supergroup called the opisthokonts , which also include the choanoflagellates, fungi
and a few small parasitic protists . The name comes from the posterior location of the
flagellum in motile cells, such as most animal spermatozoa, whereas other eukaryotes tend to
have anterior flagella.

The first fossils that might represent animals appear towards the end of the Precambrian ,
around 610 million years ago, and are known as the Ediacaran or Vendian biota . These are
difficult to relate to later fossils, however. Some may represent precursors of modern
phyla, but they may be separate groups, and it is possible they are not really animals at all.
Aside from them, most known animal phyla make a more or less simultaneous appearance during
the Cambrian period, about 542 million years ago. It is still disputed whether this event,
called the Cambrian explosion , represents a rapid divergence between different groups or a
change in conditions that made fossilization possible. However some paleontologists and
geologists would suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought,
possibly even as early as 1 billion years ago. Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in
Tonian era strata in India indicate the presence of triploblastic worm like metazoans
roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms . [6] In addition during the
beginning of the Tonian period around 1 billion years ago (roughly the same time that the trace
fossils previously discussed in this article date back to) there was a decrease in
Stromatolite diversity which may indicate the appearance of grazing animals during this
time as Stromatolites also increased in diversity shortly after the end-Ordovician and
end-Permian rendered large amounts of grazing marine animals extinct and decreased shortly
after their populations recovered. However some other scientists doubt that these fossils
are authentic and have suggested these trace fossils are just the result of natural processes
such as erosion.[ citation needed ]



[ edit ] Groups of animals

a sea fan , Iciligorgia schrammi, and a sea rod, Plexaurella nutans.

The sponges ( Porifera ) were long thought to have diverged from other animals early. As
mentioned above, they lack the complex organization found in most other phyla. Their cells
are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into distinct tissues. Sponges are
sessile and typically feed by drawing in water through pores. Archaeocyatha , which have
fused skeletons, may represent sponges or a separate phylum. However, a phylogenomic study
in 2008 of 150 genes in 21 genera [7] revealed that it is the Ctenophora or comb jellies which are
the basal lineage of animals, at least among those 21 phyla. The authors speculate that
sponges—or at least those lines of sponges they investigated—are not so primitive, but
may instead be secondarily simplified.

Among the other phyla, the Ctenophora and the Cnidaria , which includes sea anemones , corals ,
and jellyfish , are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening,
which serves as both the mouth and the anus. Both have distinct tissues, but they are not
organized into organs . There are only two main germ layers, the ectoderm and endoderm, with
only scattered cells between them. As such, these animals are sometimes called diploblastic
. The tiny Placozoans are similar, but they do not have a permanent digestive chamber.

The remaining animals form a monophyletic group called the Bilateria . For the most part, they
are bilaterally symmetric, and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory
organs. The body is triploblastic , i.e. all three germ layers are well-developed, and
tissues form distinct organs. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and
there is also an internal body cavity called a coelom or pseudocoelom. There are exceptions to
each of these characteristics, however - for instance adult echinoderms are radially
symmetric, and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.

Genetic studies have considerably changed our understanding of the relationships within
the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages: the Deuterostomes and
Protostomes , which includes the Ecdysozoa , Platyzoa , and Lophotrochozoa . In addition,
there are a few small groups of bilaterians with relatively similar structure that appear to
have diverged before these major groups. These include the Acoelomorpha , Rhombozoa , and
Orthonectida . The Myxozoa , single-celled parasites that were originally considered
Protozoa, are now believed to have developed from the Bilateria as well.



[ edit ] Deuterostomes



Superb Fairy-wren , Malurus cyaneus

Deuterostomes differ from the other Bilateria, called protostomes , in several ways. In both
cases there is a complete digestive tract. However, in protostomes the initial opening (the
archenteron ) develops into the mouth, and an anus forms separately. In deuterostomes this is
reversed. In most protostomes, cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the
mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes it forms through
invagination of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching. Deuterostomes also have a
dorsal, rather than a ventral, nerve chord and their embryos undergo different cleavage.

All this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages.
The main phyla of deuterostomes are the Echinodermata and Chordata . The former are radially
symmetric and exclusively marine, such as starfish , sea urchins , and sea cucumbers . The
latter are dominated by the vertebrates , animals with backbones. These include fish ,
amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals .

In addition to these, the deuterostomes also include the Hemichordata or acorn worms.
Although they are not especially prominent today, the important fossil graptolites may
belong to this group.

The Chaetognatha or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes, but more recent studies suggest
protostome affinities.



[ edit ] Ecdysozoa



Yellow-winged Darter , Sympetrum flaveolum

The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, named after the common trait of growth by moulting or ecdysis .
The largest animal phylum belongs here, the Arthropoda , including insects , spiders , crabs ,
and their kin. All these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically
with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada , are close
relatives of the arthropods and share these traits.

The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, the second largest animal phylum.
Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is
water. A number are important parasites. Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha
or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha , Priapulida , and Loricifera . These groups have a
reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.

The remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes grouped together as the Spiralia ,
since in both embryos develop with spiral cleavage.



[ edit ] Platyzoa



Bedford's flatworm , Pseudobiceros bedfordi

The Platyzoa include the phylum Platyhelminthes , the flatworms. These were originally
considered some of the most primitive Bilateria, but it now appears they developed from more
complex ancestors. [8]

A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the flukes and tapeworms . Flatworms
are acoelomates , lacking a body cavity, as are their closest relatives, the microscopic
Gastrotricha . [9]

The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate . The most prominent
are the Rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aqueous environments. They also include the
Acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms, the Gnathostomulida , Micrognathozoa , and possibly
the Cycliophora . [10] These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are
called the Gnathifera .



[ edit ] Lophotrochozoa



Roman snail , Helix pomatia

The Lophotrochozoa include two of the most successful animal phyla, the Mollusca and
Annelida . [11] [12] The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum, includes animals
such as snails , clams , and squids , and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as
earthworms and leeches . These two groups have long been considered close relatives because
of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the
arthropods, [13] because they are both segmented. Now this is generally considered
convergent evolution , owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two
phyla. [14]

The Lophotrochozoa also include the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula , and several
phyla that have a fan of cilia around the mouth, called a lophophore . [15] These were
traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. [16] but it now appears they are
paraphyletic , [17] some closer to the Nemertea and some to the Mollusca and Annelida. [18]
[19] They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record,
the Entoprocta , the Phoronida , and possibly the Bryozoa or moss animals. [20]



[ edit ] Model organisms

Main articles: Model organism and Animal testing

Because of the great diversity found in animals, it is more economical for scientists to study
a small number of chosen species so that connections can be drawn from their work and
conclusions extrapolated about how animals function in general. Because they are easy to
keep and breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans have long been the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms , and were among
the first lifeforms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely
reduced state of their genomes , but the double-edged sword here is that with many genes ,
introns and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans can teach us little about the origins of animals
in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the superphylum will be revealed by the
crustacean, annelid, and molluscan genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the
starlet sea anemone genome has emphasised the importance of sponges, placozoans, and
choanoflagellates , also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes
unique to the Eumetazoa. [21]

An analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela also suggests that the last
common ancestor of sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously
assumed. [22]

Other model organisms belonging to the animal kingdom include the mouse ( Mus musculus ) and
zebrafish ( Danio rerio }.



[ edit ] History of classification



Carolus Linnaeus known as the father of modern taxonomy

Aristotle divided the living world between animals and plants , and this was followed by
Carolus Linnaeus (Carl von LinnÃ©), in the first hierarchical classification. Since then
biologists have begun emphasizing evolutionary relationships, and so these groups have
been restricted somewhat. For instance, microscopic protozoa were originally considered
animals because they move, but are now treated separately.

In Linnaeus 's original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the
classes of Vermes , Insecta , Pisces , Amphibia , Aves , and Mammalia . Since then the last four
have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata , whereas the various other forms
have been separated out. The above lists represent our current understanding of the group,
though there is some variation from source to source.
