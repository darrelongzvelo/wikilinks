Orange County is a county in Southern California , United States . Its county seat is Santa Ana .
According to the 2000 Census, its population was 2,846,289, making it the second most
populous county in the state of California , and the fifth most populous in the United States .
The state of California estimates its population as of 2007 to be 3,098,121 people, dropping
its rank to third, behind San Diego County . [1]

Unlike many other large centers of population in the United States , Orange County uses its
county name as its source of identification whereas other places in the country are
identified by the large city that is closest to them. This is because there is no defined center
to Orange County like there is in other areas which have one distinct large city. Five Orange
County cities have populations exceeding 170,000 while no cities in the county have
populations surpassing 360,000.

It is also famous as a tourist destination, as the county is home to such attractions as
Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm , as well as sandy beaches for swimming and surfing , yacht
harbors for sailing and pleasure boating, and extensive area devoted to parks and open space
for golf , tennis , hiking , kayaking , cycling , skateboarding , and other outdoor recreation .
It is at the center of Southern California's Tech Coast , with Irvine being the primary
business hub.

Thirty-four incorporated cities are located in Orange County; the newest is Aliso Viejo .
Seven of these cities are among the 200 largest cities in the United States .

Geography

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the county has a total area of 2,455 kmÂ² (948 sq mi ),
making it the smallest county in Southern California. Surface water accounts for 411 kmÂ²
(159 sq mi) of the area, 16.73% of the total; 2,045 kmÂ² (789 sq mi) of it is land.

Orange County is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean , on the north by Los Angeles County ,
on the northeast by San Bernardino County , on the east by Riverside County , and on the south by
San Diego County .

The northern part of the county lies on the coastal plain of the Los Angeles Basin , while the
southern half lies on the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains . Most of Orange County's
population reside in one of two shallow coastal valleys that lie in the basin, the Santa Ana
Valley and the Saddleback Valley . The coastal plain gently rises into the Santa Ana Mountains
, which lie within the boundaries of the county and of the Cleveland National Forest . The high
point is Santiago Peak (5,687 ft/1,733 m), about 20 mi (32 km) east of Santa Ana. Santiago Peak
and nearby Modjeska Peak , just 200 feet (60 m) shorter, form a ridge known as Saddleback ,
visible from almost everywhere in the county.

The Santa Ana River is the county's principal watercourse. Its major tributary running
through the county is Santiago Creek . Other watercourses within the county include Aliso
Creek, San Juan Creek, and Horsethief Creek. The San Gabriel River also briefly crosses into
Orange County and exits into the Pacific on the Los Angeles-Orange County line between Long
Beach and Seal Beach . Laguna Beach is home to the county's only natural lakes, Laguna Lakes ,
which are formed by water rising up against an underground fault.

Residents often divide the county into "North County" and the cities of the "South County", as
opposed to an East-West division characterized by inland and coastal cities. There is no
formal geographical division of North and South County, although a rough boundary is
considered to exist along State Route 55 (aka the Costa Mesa Freeway ). The division is
perpetuated by the popular television shows "The OC" and "Laguna Beach."

Members of the Tongva and JuaneÃ±o / LuiseÃ±o nations long inhabited the area. After the
1769 expedition of Gaspar de PortolÃ  , a Spanish expedition led by Junipero Serra named the
area Vallejo de Santa Ana (Valley of Saint Anne ). On November 1 , 1776 , Mission San Juan
Capistrano became the first permanent European settlement. Among the group of explorers
that came with PortolÃ¡ were JosÃ© Manuel Nieto and JosÃ© Antonio Yorba . Both of these
men were given land grants and their heirs also inherited portions of family land. The oldest
of the Orange County land grants or ranchos was Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana granted in 1810 by
Ferdinand VII of Spain . The Yorba heirs Bernardo and Teodosio Yorba inherited ranches in 1834
and 1846 respectively. Their ranches were known as Rancho CaÃ±Ã³n de Santa Ana (Santa Ana
Canyon Ranch) and Rancho Lomas de Santiago .The Nieto heirs Juan JosÃ© and Antonio Nieto
were granted land in 1834. The Nieto ranches were known as Rancho Los Alamitos, Rancho Las
Bolsas, and Rancho Los Coyotes. Other ranches in Orange County were granted by the Mexican
government post 1821, year of Mexican Independence, during the Mexican period in Alta
California .

A severe drought in the 1860s devastated the prevailing industry, cattle ranching , and much
land came into the possession of Richard O'Neill , [2] James Irvine and other land barons . In
1887 , silver was discovered in the Santa Ana Mountains , attracting settlers via the Santa Fe
and Southern Pacific Railroads . This growth led the California legislature to divide Los
Angeles County and create Orange County as a separate political entity on March 11 , 1889 . It
was named for its most famous product [3] , but other citrus crops, avocados , and oil
extraction were also important to the early economy.

Orange County benefited from the July 4 , 1904 completion of the Pacific Electric Railway , a
trolley connecting Los Angeles with Santa Ana and Newport Beach . The link made Orange County
an accessible weekend retreat for celebrities of early Hollywood . It was deemed so
significant that the city of Pacific City changed its name to Huntington Beach in honor of
Henry Huntington , president of the Pacific Electric and nephew of robber baron Collis
Huntington . Transportation further improved with the completion of the State Route and U.S.
Route 101 (now mostly Interstate 5 ) in the 1920s .

Agriculture, such as the boysenberry which was made famous by Buena Park native Walter Knott ,
began to decline after World War II but the county's prosperity soared. The completion of
Interstate 5 in 1954 helped make Orange County a bedroom community for many who moved to
Southern California to work in aerospace and manufacturing. Orange County received a
further boost in 1955 with the opening of Disneyland .

In 1969 , Yorba Linda -born Orange County native Richard Nixon became the 37th President of the
United States .

In the 1980s , the population topped two million for the first time. Orange County had become
the second largest county in California.

A spectacular investment fund melt-down in 1994 led to the criminal prosecution of Orange
County treasurer Robert Citron . The county lost at least $1.5 billion through high-risk
investments in derivatives . [4] On December 6, 1994 , Orange County declared Chapter 9
bankruptcy, [4] from which it emerged in June 1995 ; this was the largest ever municipal
bankruptcy in the U.S. [4]

In recent years, the county has been characterized by conflict between the older more
historic northern and newer southern cities over development, the building of new toll roads
, and a recently defeated proposal to build an international airport at the former El Toro
Marine Corps Air Station that would have reduced operations at the existing John Wayne
Airport .

The area's warm Mediterranean climate and 42 miles (68 km) of year-round beaches attract
millions of tourists annually. Huntington Beach is a hot spot for sunbathing and surfing ;
nicknamed "Surf City, U.S.A.", it is home to many surfing competitions. "eVocal", on the west
side of Costa Mesa is the center of Orange County's underground artistic movement. "The
Wedge", at the tip of The Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach, is one of the most famous body
surfing spots in the world. Other tourist destinations include the theme parks Disneyland
and Disney's California Adventure in Anaheim and Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park . The
Anaheim Convention Center is the largest such facility on the West Coast. The old town area in
the City of Orange (the traffic circle at the middle of Chapman Ave. at Glassell) still
maintains its 1950s image, and appeared in the That Thing You Do! movie. Little Saigon is
another notable tourist destination, being home to the largest concentration of Vietnamese
people outside of Vietnam. There are also sizable Taiwanese, Chinese, and Korean
communities, particularly in western Orange County. This is evident in several
Asian-influenced shopping centers in Asian American hubs like the city of Irvine.

Other notable structures include the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse in Santa
Ana , the largest building in the county; the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove , the largest
house of worship in California; the historic Balboa Pavilion [2] in Newport Beach; the
Huntington Beach Pier; and the restored Mission San Juan Capistrano .

Some of the most exclusive (and expensive) neighborhoods in the U.S. are located here, many
along the Orange County Coast , and some in north Orange County. Large shopping malls exist
throughout the county, such as the Irvine Spectrum Center , South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa ,
Fashion Island in Newport Beach , The Block at Orange , Downtown Disney in Anaheim , and the
recently remodeled Shops at Mission Viejo in Mission Viejo .

Historical points of interest include Mission San Juan Capistrano (destination of
migrating swallows), and the Richard Nixon Presidential Library & Museum in Yorba Linda . The
Nixon Home is a National Historic Landmark , as is the home of a very different character, Madam
Helena Modjeska , in Modjeska Canyon on Santiago Creek .

Since the premiere in fall 2003 of the hit FOX series The OC , tourism has increased with
travelers from across the globe hoping to see the sights seen in the show.

Orange County is a chartered county of California; its seat is Santa Ana . Its legislative and
executive authority is vested in a five-member Board of Supervisors. Each Supervisor is
popularly elected from a regional district, and together the board oversees the activities
of the county's agencies and departments and sets policy on development, public
improvements, and county services. At the beginning of each year the Supervisors select a
Chairman and Vice-Chairman, but the administration is headed by a professional municipal
manager, the County Executive. The current supervisors are Janet Nguyen , John Moorlach ,
Bill Campbell , Chris Norby , and Pat Bates .

Seven other public officials are elected at-large: the County Assessor,
Auditor-Controller, Clerk-Recorder, District Attorney, Sheriff-Coroner,
Treasurer-Tax Collector and Public Administrator. Since 1999, the Orange County Sheriff's
Department has been led by Sheriff-Coroner Mike Carona .

Orange County has long been known as a Republican stronghold and has consistently sent
Republican representatives to the state and federal legislatures. Republican majorities
in Orange County helped deliver California's electoral votes to Republican presidential
candidates Richard Nixon ( 1960 , 1968 and 1972 ), Gerald Ford ( 1976 ), Ronald Reagan ( 1980 and
1984 ) and George H. W. Bush ( 1988 ). Orange County has not voted for a Democratic presidential
candidate since Franklin D. Roosevelt 's United States presidential election, 1936|1936]]
landslide re-election for a second term. Although Democrats have made inroads in the
northern end of the county since the mid-1980s, Orange County politics are still dominated by
Republicans. Five of the county's six U.S. Representatives , four of its five State Senators
and seven of its nine State Assembly members are Republicans, as are all five members of the
County Board of Supervisors. Only four Democrats have carried the county in a statewide race
in the last 50 years; Jerry Brown in his successful campaign for Governor in 1978, March Fong Eu
for Secretary of State and Kenneth Cory for State Controller, both also in 1978 and Kathleen
Connell for Controller in 1998.

In Congress, representatives whose districts are completely or partially in the county
include Republicans Ed Royce ( CA-40 ), Gary Miller ( CA-42 ), Ken Calvert ( CA-44 ), Dana
Rohrabacher ( CA-46 ), and John Campbell ( CA-48 ), and Democrat Loretta Sanchez ( CA-47 ). In
the State Senate, Senators whose districts are completely or partially in the county include
Republicans Bob Margett (SD-29), Dick Ackerman (SD-33), Tom Harman (SD-35), and Mark Wyland
(SD-38), and Democrat Lou Correa (SD-34). In the State Assembly, Assemblymembers whose
districts are completely or partially in the county include Republicans Bob Huff (AD-60),
Jim Silva (AD-67), Van Tran (AD-68), Chuck DeVore (AD-70), Todd Spitzer (AD-71), Michael D.
Duvall (AD-72), and Mimi Walters (AD-73), and Democrats Tony Mendoza (AD-56) and Jose
Solorio (AD-69).

According to the Orange County Registrar of Voters, as of December 26 , 2006 , Orange County had
1,501,843 registered voters. Of these registered voters, 47.78% (717,546) are registered
Republicans, and 30.08% (451,706) are registered Democrats, giving the Republicans a
registration advantage of 17.7% (265,840) â€“ or over a quarter of a million voters. An
additional 18.19% (273,215) declined to state a political party, and the remaining 3.95%
(59,376) are registered with minor political parties. [5]

Orange County has produced such notable Republicans as President Richard Nixon (born in
Yorba Linda and lived in San Clemente ), U.S. Senator John F. Seymour (previously mayor of
Anaheim ), and U.S. Senator Thomas Kuchel (of Anaheim ). Former Congressman Chris Cox (of
Newport Beach ), a White House counsel for President Ronald Reagan , is currently chairman of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Orange County was also home to former
Republican Congressman John G. Schmitz , a presidential candidate in 1972 from the
ultra-conservative American Independent Party and the father of Mary Kay Letourneau . In
1996, Curt Pringle (currently mayor of Anaheim ) became the first Republican-elected
Speaker of the California State Assembly in decades.

While the growth of the county's Hispanic and Asian populations in recent decades has
significantly influenced the culture of Orange County, its conservative reputation has
remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and
other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics,
with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When
Democrat Loretta Sanchez defeated veteran Republican Bob Dornan in the congressional
contest of 1996 , she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district
that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman Jerry Patterson .
Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a Republican, and she is viewed as having moderate or even
conservative positions on many issues.

Republicans have responded to the influx of ethnic immigrants by making more explicit
efforts to court the Hispanic and Asian vote. In 2004, George W. Bush captured 60% of the
county's vote, up from 56% in 2000, despite a higher Democratic popular vote compared with the
2000 election. Although Barbara Boxer won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than
she did in 1998, Republican Bill Jones defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. And while the 39%
that John Kerry received is higher than the percentage Bill Clinton won in both 1992 and 1996,
the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (60% of the vote) is the highest any
presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in
the county. In 2006, Senator Dianne Feinstein won 45% of the vote in the county, the highest
margin of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades. Democratic strength is
concentrated in the communities of Santa Ana , Laguna Beach , and Laguna Woods .

The county features prominently in the book Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New
American Right by Lisa McGirr. She argues that the county's conservative political
orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by Midwestern transplants, who
reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the civil rights movement , and the turmoil of the
1960s in nearby Los Angeles â€” across the " Orange Curtain ."

In the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs
and a sub-culture of residents to hold "Middle American" values that emphasized a capitalist
religious morality in contrast to West coast progressive liberalism that well existed
there.

Orange County has a high portion of Republican voters from culturally conservative
Asian-American , Middle Eastern and Latino immigrants, many came as refugees from wars and
dictatorships, are strongly loyal to policies of the Republican party to defeat communism
and radical Islamic terrorism. High numbers of Vietnamese-Americans in Garden Grove and
Westminster are also Republican loyalists for the party's anti-communist policies.
Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber Democrats at a rate of 55% to 22%.
Republican Assemblyman Van Tran was elected to become the first Vietnamese-American to
serve in a state legislature and is tied with Texan Hubert Vo as the highest-ranking elected
Vietnamese-American in the United States. In the 2007 Special Election for the vacant county
supervisor seat following Democrat Lou Correa 's election to the state senate, two
Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated
from each other by only 7 votes, making the Board of Supervisors all-Republican.

Edit



Surface transportation in Orange County relies heavily on several major interstate
highways: the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), the San Diego Freeway ( I-405 and I-5 south of Irvine),
and the San Gabriel River Freeway ( I-605 ), which only briefly enters Orange County territory
in the northwest. The other freeways in the county are state highways, and include the
perpetually congested Riverside and Artesia Freeway ( CA/SR-91 ) and the Garden Grove
Freeway ( CA/SR-22 ) running east-west, and the Orange Freeway ( CA/SR-57 ), the Costa Mesa
Freeway ( SR/CA-55 ), the Laguna Freeway ( CA/SR-133 ), the San Joaquin Transportation
Corridor ( CA/SR-73 ), the Eastern Transportation Corridor ( CA/SR-261 , CA/SR-133 ,
CA/SR-241 ), and the Foothill Transportation Corridor ( CA/SR-241 ) running north-south.
Minor stub freeways include the Richard M. Nixon Freeway (CA/SR-90), also known as Imperial
Highway, and the southern terminus of Pacific Coast Highway (CA/SR-1).

Public transit

Edit



Transit in Orange County is offered primarily by the Orange County Transportation Authority
. The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) cited OCTA as the best large
property transportation system in the United States for 2005. OCTA manages the county's bus
network and funds the construction and maintenance of local streets, highways, and freeways
; regulates taxicab services; maintains express toll lanes through the median of the
Riverside Freeway (SR/CA-91); and works with Southern California's Metrolink to provide
commuter rail service along three lines - the Orange County Line , the 91 Line , and the Inland
Empire-Orange County Line .

The bus network comprises 6,542 stops on 77 lines, running along most major streets, and
accounts for 210,000 boardings a day. The fleet of 817 buses is gradually being replaced by LNG
-powered vehicles, which already represent over 40% of the total.

Starting in 1992, Metrolink has operated three commuter rail lines through Orange County,
and has also maintained Rail-to-Rail service with parallel Amtrak service. On a typical
weekday, 40 trains run along the Orange County Line , the 91 Line and the Inland Empire-Orange
County Line . Along with Metrolink riders on parallel Amtrak lines, these lines generate over
12,000 boardings per weekday. Metrolink also began offering weekend service on the Orange
County Line and the Inland Empire-Orange County line in the summer of 2006. As ridership has
steadily increased in the region, new stations have opened at Anaheim Canyon, Tustin , and
Laguna Niguel , and a new station in Buena Park is slated to open in 2008 . Stations at Placentia
and Yorba Linda are proposed for future construction.

Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) will be making its debut in 2008.

A car and passenger ferry service, the Balboa Island Ferry , comprising three ferries running
every five minutes, operates between Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Island in Newport Beach .

Orange County's only major airport is the John Wayne-Orange County Airport (SNA). It is
located in unincorporated territory surrounded by the cities of Newport Beach, Santa Ana,
Costa Mesa, and Irvine. Its modern Thomas F. Riley Terminal handles over 8 million passengers
annually through 14 different airlines.

Edit



    Orange County has been the setting for numerous films and television shows:

    - It is best-known as the setting of the eponymous 2003 Fox Network television drama The
    O.C. which is set in the Orange County coastal harbor town of Newport Beach (although the
    series is actually filmed in Los Angeles County to keep production costs down). It is a
    very loose and locally criticized interpretation of the county and its residents.

    

    - It is the subject and setting of the eponymous 2002 movie Orange County . However, the
    film was not actually filmed in Orange County.

    

    - It is also the setting of the 2003 sitcom Arrested Development . Most of the series was not
    filmed in Orange County, but in Culver City and Marina Del Rey in Los Angeles County . A
    running joke in the series that pokes fun at The O.C. is that characters will frequently
    refer to Orange County as "The O.C.," followed by another character's saying "don't call
    it that," (mirroring the fact that few actual Orange County residents use the acronym
    "O.C.").

    

    - The closing scene in Rain Man with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise was shot at the Santa Ana
    Regional Transportation Center.

    

    - The film Better Luck Tomorrow was shot and set in the cities of Cypress and Anaheim.

    

    - The film Life as a House was set in Laguna Beach , although it was filmed in Los Angeles
    County .

    

    - The film Brick was shot and set in San Clemente

    

    - MTV 's Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County was filmed in the Orange County coastal town
    of Laguna Beach .

    

    - A key scene in the film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious
    Nation of Kazakhstan was shot and set at The Block at Orange in the city of Orange .

    

    - The Christian Slater film Gleaming The Cube was filmed in Anaheim and Irvine, at
    Woodbridge high school.

    

    - A plot line in the television drama The West Wing involved a dead liberal Democrat
    unexpectedly winning a Congressional seat from an Orange County district.

    

    - Orange County is the home of the late Republican President Teddy Bridges on the (now
    canceled) ABC drama Commander in Chief .

    

    - Sayid Jarrah from the ABC drama Lost was bound to go to Irvine, where his longtime friend
    Nadia lives. John Locke , another castaway from the series, is said to work in Tustin .

    

    - Orange County was the location of the 1994 Charlie Sheen movie The Chase .

    

    - The Park Place, Irvine corporate mall was the location for futuristic scenes in the 1996
    film Demolition Man starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes .

    

    - The 2006 film A Scanner Darkly was set in the city of Anaheim . A freeway scene was shot
    along the Northbound I-5 in Tustin .

    

    - The show The Real Housewives of Orange County which is filmed in Coto De Caza .

    

    - Costa Mesa is the setting for the The X-Files episode "Hungry".

    

    - In the 2001 film The Fast and the Furious , the scene when the Johnny Tran and his gang catch
    up with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker blowing up their car was filmed in Garden Grove.

    



Orange County has also been used as a shooting location for several films and television
programs. Examples of movies at least partially shot in Orange County are Tom Hanks 's That
Thing You Do , the Coen Brothers ' The Man Who Wasn't There , and the Martin Lawrence movie Big
Momma's House . All three of which were filmed in or around the Old Towne Plaza in the City of
Orange.

Edit



Orange County has a history of large master planned communities. Nearly 30% of the county was
created as master planned communities, the most notable being the City of Irvine , Coto de Caza
, Anaheim Hills , Tustin Ranch , Ladera Ranch , Talega , and Mission Viejo . Irvine has become the
model master planned city, encompassing many villages which were all planned under a master
plan by the Irvine Company in the mid-1960s. Many communities within California and
throughout the country (and even outside the country including China ) have used these Orange
County developments as models for their own planning. Elements such as community
clubhouses, numerous community pools, pocket parks, horse trails, and active associations
were first established in Orange County master planned communities and have been copied in
numerous places throughout the United States .

Main article: Notable Orange County residents

Due to Orange County's proximity to Los Angeles , the entertainment capital of the United
States, many film and media celebrities have moved or bought second homes in the county. Actor
John Wayne , who lived in Newport Beach , is the namesake for Orange County's John Wayne Airport
. Orange County has also produced many homegrown celebrities, including golfer Tiger Woods ,
basketball player Dennis Rodman , a number of professional ballplayers, including retired
slugger Mark McGwire , actor Kevin Costner , comedian/actors Steve Martin and Will Ferrell ,
actresses Michelle Pfeiffer and Diane Keaton , and singers Chester Bennington , Bonnie Raitt
, Gwen Stefani , Jeff Buckley , and Drake Bell .

The county's most famous resident was perhaps Richard Nixon , the 37th President of the United
States , who was born in Yorba Linda and lived in San Clemente for several years following his
resignation . His presidential library is in Yorba Linda.
