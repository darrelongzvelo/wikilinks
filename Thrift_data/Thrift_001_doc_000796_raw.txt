It's Not About SEO. It's About YEO.



The focus on search engine optimization in blogging is a distraction.





Image: /image_store/uploads/9/1/1/4/2/ar117486365424119.jpg For the Project Blogger
competition, I've actually told Julie Ferenzi to stop thinking about it. She was becoming a
little fixated on the search engines finding her and was spending a lot of time reading about
how to get good search engine placement. It didn't surprise me.

SEO tends to dominate discussions about the benefits of blogging and it shouldn't. Don't get
me wrong, I'm a geek. (Did I say that out loud?) I like the "science" of SEO. I read as much as I can
on the topic. It helps keep Alzheimer's at bay. So I know it plays a role in a blogs success. I'm
not saying SEO isn't important. I'm just quite certain that all too often it's prominence in
our conversations leads us away from the meat of the issue. Successful blogging, in the long
run, has nothing to do with search engines or the bots they send out each night to scrape our
sites.

Focusing so much on SEO seems like a good deal of overkill anyway. A good blog platform, like
Wordpress , does most of the SEO heavy lifting for you. Use a blog platform like WordPress and
consistently write a lot of original text about your topics and search engines will like you.
Let me say that agin... write good content, make sure you are talking about what you want to be
found for, do it consistently, do it frequently, and the search engines will find you. I know
that's over simplifying things a quite a bit, but it's not far from pure fact.

Case in point: Julie hasn't been writing that long, but today if you search on family
activities in plainfield, il , her not very populated Living In Plainfied, Illinois blog
comes up as the number 2 unpaid link. If she doesn't continue to write consistently, it won't
stay that way. But her blog is already working for her, without really focusing on SEO.

Besides, I'm not sure the way SEO works today will be the way it works tomorrow. And if everyone
starts blogging it may become harder and harder to get consistently good SEO position. So,
I'll say it again, in the long run, success in blogging has nothing to do with search engines. 
It has everything to do with relationships and seeing your blog as a way to enhance and add value
to those relationships.

Relationships won't be impacted by changes in how Google ranks pages. 



Image: /image_store/uploads/4/2/1/5/2/ar117486382625124.jpg So, as we officially kick
off Project Blogger , allow me introduce a new acronym into the discussion: YEO

YEO: You Engaging Others.

If you want to be successful in blogging, you need to understand how to engage others in every
aspect of the blogging experience.

Where Engagement Begins

Of course content is important, but it has to go beyond that. And it starts before you begin to
write a single word.   .

You live in the area you write about. So it's the people that really matter. The relationships
you develop as you go out and meet the folks at the new home sites, at local businesses, at
association meetings and anywhere else you choose to focus your writing, those real, live
human beings are your ultimate target. Why wait for them to find you in a search?

Introduce Yourself & Your Blog

Before you write a single word, make sure you introduce yourself, tell the people who are
associated with your post that will be writing about them. Explain why. Explain the purpose of
your blog and why people want to read it and why you think people will be interested in them,
their business or their mission. Ask if you can quote them. Take their picture. More often than
not, they'll be more than willing to talk to you and share information you may not be able to
obtain any other way. 

Harness The Power Of Their Relationships

Obtain their email address and phone number, then send them the link to your post. Be sure to use
their name in the posts and a photo if you took one. Most people don't get to see their name in
print very often, so it's a big deal to be written about by someone else. They WILL remember you
for that. Here's something else they will do, they'll forward the link to friends, family and
business associates. You extend your reach virally. And you don't have to just depend on
someone finding the story on Google to make it happen. 

That's the point. Other people know other people. Connect with them and they'll connect you.
This works whether you're writing about a local restaurant or whether you're writing about a
historic building. Put the focus on them. If you engage the people behind the stories, the
chance that they will actively participate in your success, in spreading the story, go up
dramatically.

Follow Up... But Not Via The Internet

I'm an internet junkie. I love all the gadgets and goodies and ideas . But nothing replaces a
telephone call, a handwritten note or a personal follow up visit to say "thank you." Treating
them like your customer before they're your customer. Show them, by your actions, how you
would work with anyone they might consider referring. If you can execute on the actions around
writing the post, engage them and keep them informed, they will rightly assume you'd do the
same thing in a real estate transaction.

Meet the people behind the stories and they'll be happy to share. Share the stories with them
and they'll share them with their friends and business associates. Go out of your way to treat
them with respect and those same friends and business associates will hear about that as well.
Your actions will do all your evangelizing for you.

SEO is great, YEO is better.

You Engaging Others. That's what this is really about.

Jeff - I am a firm believer in the best SEO you can do is create unique content - with all the
changes that happen with the big hitters unique content will never go away.  If we blog about
our area, our market and so on we will naturally move up in the ranks.  Of course there are
always those little things we can do to help us along that should not be over looked... but in
general you are so correct YEO is much better. (pst I am a geek too) Thesa Chambers, Principal

Jeff: What you are saying really make sense.  SEO as we know it will be done differently in the
near future; so although important is not what the focus should be on.  Yes blogging
consistently and good local contents is key.  Great Post Jennifer Fivelsdal Rhinebeck Real

Jeff, I am NOT an internet junkie. What little I know I picked up here on A.R. I know I should be
blogging and I write about the area I live in because that's what I know. So is this a good thing? I
know when I google my name I find me listed on the top 3-6  because of A.R. and Localism.
What is my goal? I'm getting about a contact a week from A.R. And does the amount of comments you
have relate to SEO / YEO? Dena Stevens ~ Putting the 'real' into REALTOR (Century 21 Canon Land &

Jeff, I've never given SEO much thought at all and my rankings are outstanding. I think it's
because I write about what I know, real estate and Poinciana. Just by being consistent my SEO
takes care of itself. I think.   Bryant Tutas-Tutas Towne Realty, Inc 8:04pm • #12

Jeff, you've got 51 votes and only 9 comments.  Folks are voting!  I agree with your topic
110%  I'm often forgetting about SEO but still do well in my local ranking.  How does #1, #2,
#4, #5 & #6 grab you?  WOOO HOOOO!  umm, on aother note, I know I'm one of the 8 who spends 3+
hrs here, Sarah may be another.  lol  That leaves another 6 hard core AR folks out there who
were willing to admit it.  Where'd you get the cool voting thingie?  Pinecrest | Palmetto

Thanks Jeff for another GREAT post and a new acrynum.  I have done a little of what you've
suggest with production builders.  I also have asked a few people from time to time to tell me
about their business so I can include it on my blog.  I need to follow up with that and start
using that technique more so.  Looking forward to the project blogger posts. Cynthia Sloop
(Community Association Manager) 8:07pm • #16 Great point. I'm thankful that my site has
generated a modest bit of traffic.  Most of it is generated from my on-line 'contributions'
in areas where a more local audience is likely to find me.  I have to say, it's been more
effective than SEO, though I am greatful for any traffic the search engines send my way as well.

Jeff: Great information.  I have spent hours and hours this week thinking, talking and

Thanks, Jeff, for the encouragement to NOT focus on SEO, at least excessively. It all makes
sense - you engaging others, and it DOES work. I really enjoy the community profiles and
getting down to the very local level by engaging those that you want to know, or want to write
about, is an outstanding idea. Plus it's just good relationship building. Who knows where it
can lead?

All... I hope I didn't give the impression that SEO doesn't matter, it certainly does. I just
feel strongly that the volume of conversation around it can be a distraction from what makes it
work on levels beyond the search engines. It's all about relationships.

Thesa, Moniks, & Renee... I think this can, at times, seem much harder than it really is.
Finding a way to make the blogging a part of your daily relationship building activities has to
be a goal.

Julie... you're doing great!

Diana... Dustin Luther said this to me at lunch a few weeks ago, and I'm not quoting exactly, but
it went something like this... Wordpress does such a good job of serving information the way
the search engines like it you almost don't need to think about SEO. Dustin... if I've
misquoted you and you're reading this, PLEASE correct me. I think he's right. I'm not a fan of
blogger, personally, but I have no reasons other than personal preference.

Mary, Deborah, Kelly, Ricardo, Jennifer... thank you.

Dena... one contact per week? I don't know about the rest of the gang here on AR, but that's
sounds pretty good to me.  Jeff Turner (Real Estate Shows) 10:50pm • #28

Bryant... you epitomize YEO to me. Why? Because you are clear with your sellers. You're going
to be writing about them and you write it straight. What seller wouldn't check to see what
you're saying? What seller wouldn't tell others if they see you talking about them? You
concentrate on the relationship in your stories and it translates well to the reader. You
don't need to think about SEO. You got the YEO down.

David... I would expect exactly what you're describing.

Diana... keep reading, but definitely start writing. As you go through your day, look at what
interests you, who you meet. Think about how you can HELP THEM. Think about how YOUR blog can
help them grow, give them publicity, etc. Focus on how you can add value to those
relationships. The writing can come from that.

Jeff, great post. As with all marketing, it needs to get personal. If we are blogging only to
gain "market share" it still needs to be relevant to our audience. While the techniques might
change (blogging vs. direct mail), the result still needs to be focused on the needs of our
intended audience. SEO helps that, but only to the degree that sending direct mail to a zip code
does.

I can type Larry Morris in google and I'll never be the top guy. There's a famous recording
artist from down under who stole my name and a congressman. There's even a Larry Morris in
Oregon who writes on history... But as you get more specific with items I've blogged on then the
listings get higher.

Most blogs seem informational and disconnected, your seem much more like a column where you
are writing to me. The key is how do we get readers to come back for more... YEO have mastered
it... Larry Morris, Oregon Mortgages (HomeStreet Bank) 11:27pm • #39 APR 10 2007

Jeff-I got some great new ideas to use from this blog.  I especially like the idea about
introducing the people that I work with and are part of the neighborhood.  Thank goodness
there are people like you out there to let people like me know about opportunities like that
because I would have never thought of that.  Aloha! 1SG (Ret) David Kucic, President and

JT

Well put..

You've certainly shown me how to make the most of this.   I don't read too much about SEO
because most of that jargon is over my head, but knowing how to talk with people and build
relationships is something I do understand.  Blogging helps cultivate these
relationships, do it well and the relationships grow and so does the readership, and the SEO
rankings.   What else do I need to know...

You said to me once before,  "CONENT IS KING".. Its that simple.

Thanks

Jeff,

Thank you for providing some very valuable information as well as great ideas!  You have
actually inspired me to focus a little more on Localism.com and getting some information,
stories, and pictures together about my area.  I could also spotlight some local
businesses, attractions and history.

Thanks!

Jeff: Just last week I started walking around my little town and taking photos of shops or
service peple or locations that could be grouped together in a blog.  I introduced myself to
each pers, left them a card and asked permission to put them in a post.  People seemed thrilled
and many offered to exchange links with me.  As a new realtor, new website owner and new AR
member I think it was a very positive experience.  Imagine  my pleasure when someone as
higly regarded on AR as yourself validated my efforts.  I read all of your posts.  Thanks for

David & Tonya, thank you.

Ardell, interesting question. I found dooce.com years ago before I even knew what a blog was. I
was doing a search for wedding photos and found hers. They were amazing by the way. I emailed her
and asked permission to use them in a demo of a very, very beta version of RealEstateShows.com.
She was kind enough to be gentle with me (if you read her often you know that she can be un-gentle)
and tell me her wedding photos were very personal, declined,  but that she loved the idea.
This, of course, was long before her Federated Media deals and her 1,000,000 visits per month.
She's transparent to a fault and just flippin hilarious. Reading her is voyeurism.

Lynda, we all like to be recognized.

Martin, :)

John, the real world connections are the goal... why not start there?

Val... and my guess is you'd get tremendous enjoyment from meeting the people behind those
stories. Bonus.

Diana... excellent way to execute on that! Well done!

You and I both know that I do not blog for the same reasons as other members here. But, this post
got me a little curious.

As curiosity always kills the cat, I decided to google "The Lovely Wife". I have never done that
before.

But guess what? I am #4 and #5 on the front page of Google. Not that it matters but it was
interesting.

It means that my YEO does come with Google Juice :)

A genius article, on such a simple idea. Write a blog for reader, not search engines. It is
difficult to grasp for some, because the final goal of many RE Bloggers is to increase PR or SEO
or whatever, to convert to sales. As a marketing coordinator for a Realty Group, I am supposed
to focus on SEO. However, the steps involved in increasing a website ranking are tedious and
boring... writing good content is a great way to improve SEO without falling into the monotony
of link management, etc... Jared Loss (The OC Coastal Group) 4:26pm • #63

Hi,

Believe it or not - this is only the second time I've posted to a blog.  

Great advice, and I believe it 100%.  EVERYTHING comes down to relationships.

That said, and I'm not paid to say this, I LOVE Real Estate Shows and, by the way, so do my
clients.  Jeff is a genius.  I get so bored with some virtual tours, I can't finish them.  So
for the time and vertigo-challenged, it's the best product for the money out there.

There, I said it.  An unpaid and unsolicited endorsement.

Fellow bloggers, please don't kill me.

10:20pm • #68 Hi Jeff.  I loved this blog! My question though is, how can using a platform
like wordpress help more for this type of blogging then AR and Localism? Is it because AR is a
real estate networking and wordpress is more generalized? Thanks :D Julie McLaughlin

YEOw!  What a concept! In today's WIIFM culture, this is a great way to involve others. I've
used buy-ins for print materials - how blind I've been not to include it for internet as well.

Jeff, thank you for this...  I'm a self-proclaimed techno-idiot that has spent the last
month trying to GRASP the whole SEO thing: what it is and what I can do to promote mine, blah,
blah, blah.  Blogging is a new one for me too.  The YEO concept makes much more sense to
me...so I am gonna go with that and let the rest fall into place behind it.  It is people matter
...right on.  Thanks again for the info!

Abby... the key is doing it. Consistently doing it. And doing it on a blog platform that will
make sure you don't have to worry about it. One of the reasons why people are finding success
with their posts here on AR is that AR takes care of the mechanical details for you. So, you can
concentrate on other things. Both Wordpress and Typepad will do similarly well if set up
properly.  Jeff Turner (Real Estate Shows) 4:05pm • #80 Great post Jeff. Glad I caught the

Great post! Keep up the good work. As long as we focus on our client's and what is in their best
interest we shall always succeed! SEO is obviously very important but relationships with our
clients is Gold.Having your site optimized and at the top will no doubt lead to more leads and
possibly more clients but if we take care of the one's we have been working with we wouldn't need
to search for new ones so much!

I would really appreciate some input on why my Wordpress blog seems to be invisible to
Google. I have consistently posted about Cape San Blas Real Estate at capesanblasblog.com
 since September, have included applicable keywords and tags, etc. etc., and yet when I
Google "Cape San Blas real estate" I can go 6 or 7 pages deep and still not show up, while someone
writing in a single personal blog about their vacation at Cape San Blas and later mentioning
all the real estate signs, does show up. Have I somehow offended the Google gods? Sherri

Jeff,

Exellent reminder. Connect with others. Like Julie did, pick something you know about, and
blog about it in addition to real estate. Know the school system? Write about education in your
area. Understand the local politics? Compare candidates and platforms. Think it's
important your readers understand how the economy and unemployment affects interest rates?
Explain it to them.

They'll back to you for that info, and engage with you. Thanks again!

Jeff,

Here is a question for you.  I have four sites, www.koleabeachvillas.com ,
www.haliikaioceanfrontrentals.com , www.waikoloavacationrentals.com ,
www.hawaiivacationstop.com .  The first three contain vacation rentals.  The last one
contains vacation rentals along with activities. 

I want to start a blog using wordpress.  What is your recommendation?  To have a blog on each
site specifically about what is on that site or to have a blog on one site about everything? 



Any input would be helpful.  Thanks! Rob Dalton (Waikoloa Vacation Rentals) 12:27am •

Jeff,

I guess in blogging it works like this. You need a appropriate title with description in it, H1
for matching sake, keywords that are focused on the content and title, and good content. The
content will broaden the search keywords. The last thing is good links to the site.

Simple SEO.

I was in your audience at Bloggers Connect today, and really appreciate your presentation. 
I was given instruction to sign up in many of the media hotspots, and aggregate all of them to one
another.  Fortunately for me, my blog is still under construction so I haven't irked people
to death.  I thought the point was blog, and send it to all my followers in twitter, and my
stardom would eventually get me rich.

The funny thing is your way is a much simpler method, say hello, how are you, did you see this,
tell a joke, share a gift and be yourself.  Much less stressful.  I am engaged to a few people
at my table without any plan for nuptials-we'll see how it goes.

Thanks,

Hi Jeff:  What a great post.  It only took me almost two years to find it... but hopefully
better late than never.  This is such a great presentation for me to use in showing some of my
non-blogging friends just what all of this can accomplish.  I love your comparison on YEO vs
SEO.  Very inspiring for non-techies like me.  Thanks so much for sharing, and for being so
inventive.  Give Sarah a hug and tell her Karen Anne says hi... if she remembers me.  Take
care... Fort Worth Real Estate - - - Karen Anne Stone (New Home Hunters of Fort Worth and Tarrant

I totally agree with your post. Content is king in my eyes. Of course, on occasion I'll throw an
entry in The Keys to New Jersey for SEO purposes -- but that's on a rare occasion. I think it's
really important to let down your guard as human being. Show people that you have a sense of
humor -- that you're not just about the money. Jesse Kaye 3:01pm • #133 APR 10 2009

Thanks, Jeff.  I was also brought here from Jeff Dowler's blog.  I guess the key is both -
getting found and engaging.  I've bookmarked so I can reblog later.  I have a few AR friends
who are just starting WP blogs, and this will really come in handy for them and for me. Debbie
