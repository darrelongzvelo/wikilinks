    Spread the word!

    superamit :

    Two weeks ago I got a call from my doctor, who Iâ€™d gone to see the day before because
    Iâ€™d been feeling worn out and was losing weight, and wasnâ€™t sure why.

    He was brief: â€œAmit, youâ€™ve got Acute Leukemia. You need to enter
    treatment right away.â€�

    I was terrified.Â I packed a backpack full of clothes, went to the hospital as
    heâ€™d instructed, and had transfusions through the night to allow me to take a
    flight home at 7am the next day. I Googled acute leukemia as I lay in my hospital bed,
    learning that if it hadnâ€™t been caught, Iâ€™d have died within weeks.

    â€”

    I have a couple more months of chemo to go, then the next step is a bone marrow transplant. As
    Jay and Tony describe below,Â minorities are severely underrepresentedÂ in the
    bone marrow pool, andÂ  I need help .

        A few ways to help:

        1 - If youâ€™re South Asian ,Â  get a free test by mail . You rub your cheeks with
        a cotton swab and mail it back. Itâ€™s easy.

        

        2 - If youâ€™re in NYC , you canÂ  go to this event my friends are putting on .

        

        3 - If you know any South Asians Â  (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan,
        Maldives, or Sri Lanka) , please point â€˜em to the links above. Thank you.

        

    

    jayparkinsonmd :

    My friend Amit Gupta founded my favorite photography siteÂ  Photojojo . A few weeks
    ago, he was diagnosed with leukemia. Amit is one of the nicest, most genuine, most
    creative people you could ever meet. Prior to founding the awesome Photojojo, he also
    co-foundedÂ  Jelly Â in 2006 in NYC, a coworking community, thatâ€™s now
    spread to 60 cities across the world and helped spark the coworking revolution. It looks
    like Amit will need a bone marrow transplant quite soon. We can help him with that.

    tony b:

    Unlike blood transfusions, finding a genetic match for bone marrow that his body will
    accept is no easy task. The national bone marrow registry has 9.5 million records on file,
    yet the chances of someone from South Asian descent of finding a match are only 1 in 20,000.

    This is where we come in. Weâ€™re going to destroy those odds.

    How? By finding and registering as many people of South Asian descent as we possibly can.

    Tests are easyâ€“ a simple swab of the cheek. If youâ€™re a match, the donation
    involves an outpatient procedure. Itâ€™s not fun, but itâ€™s not dangerous
    either. And doing it could save a life.

    We are encouraging anyone of South Asian descent to take a test to see if youâ€™re a
    match.Â 

    You canÂ  get a free test by mail , or, if youâ€™re in New York, you canÂ  join us
    Friday, October 14th for a special party Â to rally support.

    Weâ€™ll have test kits on hand at the party, as well as music, booze, and maybe even a
    photo booth. It will, for the first time, combine a House 2.0-style party with a New Work
    City-style party, and if youâ€™ve ever been to either, you know they are always
    something special.

    Please spread the word and please do everything you can to help Amit beat leukemia.
    Heâ€™s a superstar.

    Much thanks to Tony and pals for organizing this event, and EVERYONE whoâ€™s been
    tweeting and reblogging.

    Please help get the word out any way you can. My life quite literally depends on it. 6th Oct
    2011 | 4:36 pm ♥ 8270
