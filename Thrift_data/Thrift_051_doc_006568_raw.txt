On 22 February 1972 Aldershot experienced one of the worst mainland IRA attacks. Seven
people, all civilian support staff, including cooks, cleaners, and a Catholic priest, were
killed in a car bomb attack on the 16th Parachute Brigade headquarters mess at Aldershot. This
blast was later claimed by the Official IRA as revenge for the shootings in Derry that came to be
known as Bloody Sunday . [6] A memorial has since been built on the site of the attacks. Until
then the Army Town (as the area was then known) had been open-plan , but the attack led to
immediate action to secure military property by erection of high fences topped with barbed
wire, and other security measures including armed patrols. In the last thirty years since the
attack, most regiments, notably the parachute Brigades have left Aldershot, either
amalgamating with other regiments or having relocated elsewhere. The demise of the once
proud military town has created an opportunity for local gov and planners to redevelop
Aldershots urban extension 'AUE' and sell off the area for homes.

[ edit ] Aldershot observatory

    Image: /skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png Aldershot observatory.

        Main article: Aldershot Observatory

    



The observatory is a circular red-brick building with a domed roof and it stands on Queens
Avenue. Inside is a telescope , 8-inch refractor , mounted on a German-type equatorial mount
with a clockwork drive. The telescope and observatory building were a gift from aviation
pioneer Patrick Young Alexander to the British Army, a fact which is recorded by a plaque near
the observatory door. It reads: "Presented to the Aldershot Army Corps by Patrick Y Alexander
Esq 1906".





[ edit ] Wellington Statue

    Image: /skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png 1st Duke of Wellington astride
    Copenhagen

        Main article: Wellington Statue Aldershot

    



A statue of the first Duke of Wellington mounted on his horse, Copenhagen, is situated on Round
Hill behind the Royal Garrison Church. The statue is 30 feet (9.1 m) high, 26 feet
(7.9 m) from nose to tail, over 22 feet (6.7 m) in girth, weighs 40 tons and is intricately
detailed including musculature and veins. It was designed and built by Matthew Cotes Wyatt
who used recycled bronze from cannons that were captured at the Battle of Waterloo . It took
thirty men over three years to finish the project.

Originally, in 1846, the statue was erected at Hyde Park Corner , London on the Wellington Arch
. However, Decimus Burton , architect of the arch, had tried to veto this plan for his preferred
"figure in a four horse chariot". Many agreed with Decimus Burton that the statue looked
ridiculous since it was out of proportion. It was nicknamed "The Archduke" and was a popular
topic in the satirical magazine Punch .

Queen Victoria claimed that the statue ruined the view of the skyline from Buckingham Palace ,
and she privately proposed that the statue be moved. The Duke, who had only sat for the sculptor
on two or three occasions, suddenly became very attached to the statue and would not consider
its removal from its arch.

In 1883, due to a road widening project, the arch was moved a short distance and now looks down
Constitution Hill. The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII ) wrote to the Prime Minister ,
Gladstone , " As regards the old colossal statue of the Duke. I would suggest that it should not
be broken up but removed to Aldershot where it will be highly valued by the Army ". [ citation
needed ]

In 1885, the Prince of Wales handed over the monument to Lieutenant General Anderson, the
commander of the Aldershot garrison."



[ edit ] Transport and communications



The railway station and bus station are both situated off Station Road. The former offers
services to London Waterloo (2tph), Alton (2tph), Guildford (2tph) and Ascot (2tph).



[ edit ] Shopping in Aldershot



Aldershot was the principal retail centre in the Blackwater Valley, however, other centres
have grown to compete for customers. Union Street and Wellington Street were pedestrianised
in the 1970s when the Wellington Centre, a covered shopping centre, was built. In the 1990s, an
extension of the Wellington Centre, The Galleries , provided extra shops, although nearly
all are now closed. [ citation needed ] Local traders have claimed that this centre and its
associated development are threatening the remaining independent shops operating in
Aldershot. [ citation needed ] A local councillor has claimed " we have too many empty shops in
the town ", and it is a frequent complaint of local residents that the town has declined since
the 1960s. [ citation needed ] In 2003, a health check of the town centre was published, the
report concluded that " Aldershot is experiencing promising signs of revitalisation,
particularly in the shopping core " [7] Although, in 2005, Rushmoor Borough Council
documented the percentage of vacancies at 10%, 8% and 7% respectively for Union Street, the
Wellington Centre and Wellington street. [8]



[ edit ] Education



There are various schools in Aldershot. The infant schools are Talavera and West End County.
[9] Junior schools include: Newport County, St Michael's (C of E), Talavera and Beaumont
County. [10] There is the secondary schools St Joseph's (Catholic) [11] and the Connaught.
[12]



[ edit ] Leisure and recreation





[ edit ] Theatre and the Arts



Princes Hall . This is Aldershot's main theatre and concert hall, located on Princes Way. [13]
The Princes Hall plays host to over 80 professional shows per year as well as a 3 week pantomime.
Built in the 1970s and remodelled during 1982 the current seating capacity is 600.

The West End Centre is Aldershot's arts centre which is located on Queens Road. The centre
offers a wide programme of events including music (from acoustic folk to thrash metal),
comedy, theatre, workshops, classes and exhibitions.



[ edit ] Music and Dance



Hardcore Vox (previously The Rhythm Station, Cheeks), [ citation needed ] influenced the
rapid growth of the hardcore scene from 1992 to 1995. Weekly events included Fusion (Hectic
Records), Tazmania, Slammin' Vinyl and Future World. The club also groomed local talents
such as Sharky, DJ Mystery, DJ Unknown, Vinyl Groover, DJ NS, Hixxy, MC Freestyle, MC Young, MC
Smiley. The location of Aldershot between Southampton and London meant the club became a
mecca for Hardcore and it was regularly sold out during this time. At the height of the clubs
popularity a teenagers death from a suspected overdose of Ecstasy [14] was the catalyst that
saw dance music leaving the club and had a negative impact on the hardcore dance scene in the
Aldershot area.

Acoustic music is a regular feature at The West End Centre and has in recent years included such
artists as Glenn Tilbrook , Chris Difford , John Renbourn , Jacqui McShee , Martin Simpson ,
Lindisfarne , Hans Theesink , Andy Irvine and Donal Lunny .



[ edit ] Sport



Aldershot plays host to many sports facilities such as Aldershot Tennis Centre, Aldershot
Bowling , Aldershot Pools and Lido , Aldershot Garrison Sports Centre and Alpine Snow Sports (
Dry Ski Centre). Formerly the town also hosted short circuit motor racing including speedway
and Stock car racing . Greyhound Racing formerly took place at Aldershot Stadium, and Point to
point racing at Tweseldown.

Swimming Opened in 1930, ' Aldershot Lido is a traditional outdoor leisure pool that contains
one and a half million gallons of water situated on a 10 acre site. The original land was a lake
that had become overgrown with weeds. It was bought by the Borough Council in 1920 for
Â£21,000 and was the focus of the council's improvement projects for the town. The pool has
extensive areas of shallow water for children to play including a large fountain at the
centre. It also has a diving area and water slides. There is an adjoining 25 m indoor pool that
allows all year round swimming. In 1948 the pool hosted the modern pentathlon for the London
Olympics .

Aldershot Town Football Club The local professional football team is Aldershot Town who
compete in the Blue Square Premier. Before 1992 the local club was Aldershot , which folded on
25 March 1992 , when members of the Football League Fourth Division . The current club was
formed shortly afterwards and achieved four promotions in its first 11 seasons to achieve its
current standing that leaves it just one division below the old club's final standing. The
team won promotion to the Football League [15] on the 15th April 2008 by winning the Blue Square
Premier League .

Cricket Aldershot Cricket Club is also based in the town. The club shares with the Aldershot
hockey club and the Blackwater valley runners running and jogging club.

Rugby Union. The rugby union club is Aldershot & Fleet RUFC (A&F) for both juniors and seniors
[16]

Greyhound racing took place regularly at Aldershot Stadium (actually just across the Surrey
county boundary in Tongham ) during the 1950s. Information about greyhound racing at this
venue is sketchy.

Stock Car Racing , together with other short-circuit formulae (including Superstox, Hot
Rods, Bangers and Midgets) was held regularly (every Thursday evening, every Boxing Day
afternoon and some Saturdays) at Aldershot Stadium (actually just across the Surrey county
boundary in Tongham ) from the 1950s until the final meeting on 21st November 1992.
Immediately after this date the site was cleared for construction of the A331 Blackwater
Valley Road, which forms a by-pass for Aldershot and Farnborough. The racing took place
initially on a loose shale track inside the greyhound track; after Motorcycle speedway
racing at the venue ceased the shale track was replaced with a hard tarmaced surface. Now,
short-circuit motor sport takes place in Aldershot again, at the Aldershot Raceway , Pegasus
Village, Rushmoor Arena. The racing here is promoted by the Fleet Motor Club

Speedway racing has been staged in Aldershot. Circa 1929, a track operated at a stadium in
Boxalls Lane. The records of action at this venue are very sketchy. Speedway returned to
Aldershot in 1950 at the local greyhound stadium. The Shots featured in the lower echelons of
the sport up to 1960.

Point to point racing takes place at the Tweseldown Racecourse just outside the town.

Olympics. Part of the 2012 Olympics will be held in Aldershot. It was announced on Tuesday 15th
January 2008 that the Aldershot Military Town had been chosen as the official training camp
for the British Olympic team ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.



[ edit ] Media



The local press are the Aldershot Mail , the Aldershot News , the Aldershot Courier , and the
Surrey-Hants Star . [17] Aldershot is the home of Ashgate Publishing Ltd., a prominent
publishing house for books on musicology .



[ edit ] Politics



    Aldershot is divided into the following wards: [18] [19]

    - Rowhill : southwest of the town

    

    - Wellington : west, north and centre of the town

    

    - Manor Park : south of the town

    

    - Heron Wood : southeast of the town

    

    - North Town : northeast of the town.

    



The town is represented in parliament through the Aldershot constituency . The current MP is
Gerald Howarth ( Conservative ), with a majority of 5,334 (May 2005). Of the 41 councillors on
Rushmoor Borough Council, 15 represent the five wards that comprise Aldershot. Of these
councillors, eight are Conservative , five represent Labour , one represents the Liberal
Democrats and there is one Independent.



[ edit ] Geography



The nearby villages of Ash and Ash Vale are actually in Surrey , with both being part of
Guildford Borough Council but they can have Aldershot as their post-town. This used to cause
debates locally as some residents didn't want to put Hampshire as their address. The problem
was solved when Royal Mail introduced postcodes meaning county names were no longer used in UK
postal addresses.

The town is generally between 70 m and 100 m above sea level.



[ edit ] The Beatles in Aldershot



Sam Leach, their then agent, and wanting to become their manager, attempted to introduce The
Beatles to London agents by promoting shows at The Palais Ballroom, on the corner of Perowne
Street and Queens Road, in Aldershot, on December 9th 1961. The show was not advertised
properly and, as a result, only 18 people attended. The local newspaper, The Aldershot News ,
failed to publish Sam Leach's advertisement for the show. However, the band and friends had
their own fun after the show, including a mock funeral for Paul McCartney . The failure at
Aldershot became part of Beatles folklore [1] [2] . Weeks after this Brian Epstein became the
group's manager.

[ edit ] In literature



Rudyard Kipling referenced Aldershot in his poem " Gunga Din ". â€œ You may talk oâ€™
gin and beer

When youâ€™re quartered safe out â€™ere,

Anâ€™ youâ€™re sent to penny-fights anâ€™ Aldershot it;

But when it comes to slaughter

You will do your work on water,

Anâ€™ youâ€™ll lick the bloominâ€™ boots of â€™im thatâ€™s got
it. â€�

Sir John Betjeman also mentions Aldershot in the poem "A Subaltern's Love Song" [3] â€œ
Miss J. Hunter Dunn, Miss J. Hunter Dunn,

Furnish'd and burnish'd by Aldershot sun,

What strenuous singles we played after tea,

We in the tournament - you against me!

Love-thirty, love-forty, oh! weakness of joy,

The speed of a swallow, the grace of a boy,

With carefullest carelessness, how gaily you won,

I am weak from your loveliness, Joan Hunter Dunn . â€�



[ edit ] Aldershot Military Town

Image: /skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png Sign for Aldershot Military Town

Aldershot Military Town is the area between Aldershot and the North Camp area of Farnborough
which is the location for all the military buildings, including married quarters, barracks,
army playing fields and other sporting facilities, etc., mostly centred around Queen's
Avenue. The military town includes the Aldershot Observatory and the Aldershot Military
Cemetery , the Royal Garrison Church and other garrison churches, as well as barracks for The
Royal Military Police . The town used to be the corps headquarters for the Royal Corps of
Transport and the Army Catering Corps , these were merged into the Royal Logistic Corps in 1993
and moved to Deepcut , however units of these corps remain in Aldershot.

A statue of the first Duke of Wellington mounted on his horse, Copenhagen, is situated on Round
Hill behind the Royal Garrison Church.

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert showed a keen interest in the establishment and development
of Aldershot as a garrison town in the 1850s, at the time of the Crimean War , having a wooden
Royal Pavilion built there which they would often stay in when attending reviews of the army.
In 1860 Albert established and endowed The Prince Consort's Library there, which still
exists today.

Aldershot Military Town is separate to the town of Aldershot and comes under its own military
jurisdiction. It was the homebase for The Parachute Regiment from its formation in 1940 until
it moved to Colchester Garrison in 2003. Many famous people have been associated with the
Military Town, including Charlie Chaplin who made his first stage appearance in The Canteen
theatre aged 5 in 1894, Winston Churchill , who was based here in the 19th century, and just
about every famous soldier of the 19th and 20th centuries.

The area also houses various military and regimental museums, including the Aldershot
Military Museum , housed in a red-brick Victorian barracks, [4] and The Parachute Regiment
and Airborne Forces Museum . [5]
