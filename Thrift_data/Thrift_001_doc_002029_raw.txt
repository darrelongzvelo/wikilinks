Autism Spectrum

Posted by: adifferentworld | April 1, 2012 | No Comment | From Wikipedia, the free
encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search

The autism spectrum or autistic spectrum is the range of conditions classified as Pervasive
developmental disorders . Pervasive developmental disorders include Autism , Asperger
syndrome , Childhood disintegrative disorder , Rett syndrome and Pervasive Developmental
Disorder Not Otherwise Specified . These disorders are typically characterized by social
deficits, communication difficulties, stereotyped or repetitive behaviors and
interests, and/or cognitive delays. Although these diagnoses share some common features,
individuals with these disorders are thought to be “on the spectrum” because of
differences in severity across these domains.

Autism is characterized by delays or abnormal functioning before the age of three years in one
or more of the following domains: (1) social interaction; (2) communication; and (3)
restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities.
[1] Social impairments are marked by poor use of nonverbal communication, difficulty in peer
relations, lack of social-emotional reciprocity, and lack of shared enjoyment.
Communication deficits may include failure to develop speech, use of stereotyped or delayed
echolalia , and difficulties maintaining conversations. Social and communication
impairments may also cause a lack of symbolic or imaginative play. Restricted and repetitive
behaviors may include unusual preoccupations with narrow interests, inflexibility to
nonfunctional routines, stereotyped and repetitive mannerisms, and preoccupations with
parts of objections.

Asperger Syndrome can be distinguished from autism by the lack of delay or deviance in early
language development. [1] Additionally, individuals with Asperger syndrome do not have
significant cognitive delays. An individual with Asperger syndrome typically
demonstrates obsessive interest in a single topic or activity. Other symptoms include
repetitive routines or rituals, peculiarities in speech and language, inappropriate
affect or social behavior, problems with non-verbal communication, and clumsy or
uncoordinated motor movements. [2] Because of these difficulties, individuals with
Asperger’s Disorder often have trouble interacting with others.

Unlike autism and Asperger syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder is characterized
by significant regression or loss of functioning after at least two years of typical
development. [1] A child who is affected with this condition may lose communication skills,
nonverbal behaviors, motor functioning, and/or skills that have already been learned (such
as toy play). [3] Some other symptoms include: lose of bowel and bladder control and problems
forming relationships with peers and other family members. [4]

Rett Syndrome appears only in females and is characterized by multiple deficits after a
period of normal functioning after birth. [1] At onset, Rett’s Disorder is characterized
by deceleration of head growth, loss of purposeful hand skills, loss of social engagement and
language, and poor physical coordination.

Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) is considered
“subthreshold autism” and “atypical autism” because it is often characterized by
milder symptoms of autism or symptoms in only one domain (such as social difficulties). [5]
Persons with PDD-NOS may demonstrate pervasive deficits in the development of reciprocal
social interaction or stereotyped behaviors, but do not meet the criteria for a specific
pervasive developmental disorder or other psychological disorders (such as schizophrenia
or avoidant personality disorder). [1]

[ edit ] Autism Spectrum Disorder in the DSM-V

Further information: Autism classification

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a proposed revision to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5), which will be released in May 2013. [6] This new
diagnosis will encompass current diagnoses of Autistic Disorder, Asperger’s Disorder,
Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise
Specified. Rather than categorizing these diagnoses, the DSM-5 will adopt a dimensional
approach to diagnosing disorders that fall underneath the autism spectrum umbrella. It is
thought that individuals with ASDs are best represented as a single diagnostic category
because they demonstrate similar types of symptoms and are better differentiated by
clinical specifiers (i.e., dimensions of severity) and associated features (i.e., known
genetic disorders, epilepsy and intellectual disability). An additional change to the DSM
includes collapsing social and communication deficits into one domain. Thus, an individual
with an ASD diagnosis will be described in terms of severity of social communication
symptoms, severity of fixated or restricted behaviors or interests and associated
features.

[ edit ] Epidemiology

Main article: Epidemiology of autism

Reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 6 per 1,000 for autism spectrum disorders as a whole,
[7] however prevalence rates vary for each of the developmental disorders in the spectrum.
Autism prevalence has been estimated at 1-2 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per
1,000, childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000, and PDD-NOS at 3.7 per 1,000. [7]
These rates are consistent across cultures and ethnic groups, as autism is considered a
universal disorder. [8]

While rates of autism spectrum disorders are consistent across cultures, they vary greatly
by gender, with boys being affected far more frequently than girls. The average
male-to-female ratio for ASDs is 4.2:1, [9] affecting 1 in 70 males, but only 1 in 315 females.
[10] Females, however, are more likely to have associated cognitive impairment. Among those
with an ASD and mental retardation, the sex ratio may be closer to 2:1. [11] Prevalence
differences might be accounted by gender differences in the expression of clinical
symptoms, with females showing less atypical behaviors and, therefore, less likely to
receive an ASD diagnosis. [12]

[ edit ] Etiology

Main article: Causes of autism

While a specific cause or specific causes of autism spectrum disorders has yet to be found,
many risk factors have been identified in the research literature that may contribute to the
development of an ASD. These risk factors include genetics, prenatal and perinatal factors,
neuroanatomical abnormalities, and environmental factors.

[ edit ] Genetic risk factors



The results of family and twin studies suggest that genetic factors play a role in the etiology
of autism and other pervasive developmental disorders. [13] Studies have consistently
found that the prevalence of autism in siblings of autistic children is approximately 15 to 30
times greater than the rate in the general population. [14] In addition, research suggests
that there is a much higher concordance rate among monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic
twins. [15] These studies suggest a strong genetic component in autism. It is estimated that
autism involves 5-10 genes and possibly more. [16] It appears that there is no single gene that
can account for autism. Instead, there seems to be multiple genes involved, each of which is a
risk factor for part of the autism syndrome through various groups. [17] Possible
susceptibility regions include chromosomes 1p, 2q, 7q, 13q, 16p, and 19q. [16]

[ edit ] Prenatal and perinatal risk factors



A number of prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors
for autism. These risk factors include maternal gestational diabetes, maternal and
paternal age over 30, bleeding after first trimester, use of prescription medication during
pregnancy, and meconium in the amniotic fluid. While research is not conclusive on the
relation of these factors to autism, each of these factors has been identified more
frequently in children with autism compared to their non-autistic siblings and other
normally developing youth. [18]

[ edit ] Neuroanatomical findings



In general, neuroanatomical studies support the notion that autism is linked to a
combination of brain enlargement in some areas and brain reduction in other areas. [19] These
studies suggest that autism may be caused by abnormal neuronal growth and pruning during the
early stages of prenatal and postnatal brain development, leaving some areas of the brain
with too many neurons and other areas with too few neurons. [20] Some research has reported an
overall brain enlargement in autism while others suggest abnormalities in several areas of
the brain, including the frontal lobe, the mirror neuron system, the limbic system, the
temporal lobe, and the corpus callosum.

In neuroanatomical studies, it has been shown that for individuals with Autism spectrum
disorder there is reduced activation in the primary and secondary somato-sensory cortices
during Theory of Mind and facial emotion response tasks when compared to control. This is
consistent with reports of patterns of abnormal cortical thickness and grey matter volume in
those regions in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder. [21] (Sugranyes) In normal
children, there is a bias of the left lateralized network that is essential for language
development, as shown by magnetoencephalography. Specifically, there was a left dominance
of parieto-temporal coherence in the theta band that was correlted with higher performance
on language related tasks. This was not correlated with head circumference or chronological
age. [22]

[ edit ] Frontal lobe



The frontal lobe is central to many functions that are associated with autism, such as
language and executive functions . For instance, Broca’s area , which is related to
language production, is located in the inferior prefrontal lobe. Other important areas of
the frontal lobe include: the prefrontal cortex (involved with aspects of executive
function such as working memory, inhibition, planning, organizing, set-shifting and
cognitive flexibility), the orbitofrontal cortex (involved in social cognition and theory
of mind) and the inferior frontal gyrus (part of the mirror neuron system). Current research
suggests that dysfunction in the frontal lobe may be associated with some of the deficits
observed in individuals with ASD, including social cognition, imitation, face processing,
language, attention, working memory, and problem-solving. For example, it has been found
that individuals with autism have decreased concentrations of N-acetyl-asparate (NAA) and
reduced glutaminergic neurons in the frontal lobe, suggesting some dysfunction in this
region. [23] Another study using fMRI found that boys with high-functioning autism had
reduced activity in the pars opercularis when observing and imitating emotions. [24]
Orbitofrontal cortex deficits have also been implicated with autism, as individuals with
high-functioning autism have shown decreased functioning in this area when participating
in a task that involved the perception of fearful faces., [25] Finally, individuals with ASD
have shown decreased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex relative to a control group
during a theory of mind task. [26]

[ edit ] Mirror neuron system



The mirror neuron system (MNS) consists of a network of brain areas that have been associated
with empathy processes in both animals [27] and humans. [28] In humans, the MNS has been
identified in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and is
thought to be activated during imitation or observation of behaviors. [29] It has been
suggested that the MNS generates internal representations of the self and others, which
facilitates an understanding of other people. Many researchers have hypothesized that the
MNS is related to cognitive processes such as imitative learning, “mind-reading”, and
empathy; all of which are necessary for social-communication. [30] Several studies using
functional brain-imaging have found evidence of mirror neuron dysfunction in autism, [31]
[32] suggesting this neural system is associated with social impairments in individuals
with ASDs. Specifically, it has been found that reduced mirror neuron activity and MNS
cortical thinning [33] are highly correlated with autism severity.

[ edit ] Limbic system



Social skills impairments in autism have been theorized to reflect abnormal functioning in
the limbic system . In animal models, it has been found that monkeys with lesions in the medial
temporal lobe (e.g., the amygdala and hippocampus ) demonstrate autistic-like behaviors,
such as a failure to develop normal social relationships, stereotyped movements, and poor
eye-contact. [34] Notably, it was found that that the most severe autistic symptoms resulted
from lesions in the amygdala and hippocampus whereas less severe forms resulted from lesions
to the amygdala alone. Human autopsy studies have also found evidence for limbic system
abnormalities in individuals with ASDs. These studies revealed reduced neuronal cell size
and increased cell-packing density in the hippocampus and amygdala. [35] However, MRI
studies have not found any evidence for abnormalities in the hippocampus. [36]

[ edit ] Temporal lobe



Functions of the temporal lobe are related to many of the deficits observed in individuals
with ASDs, such as receptive language, social cognition, joint attention , action
observation and empathy. The temporal lobe also contains the superior temporal sulcus (STS)
which may mediate facial processing. It has been argued that dysfunction in the STS underlie
the social deficits that characterize autism. Compared to typically developing
individuals, one fMRI study found that individuals with high functioning autism had reduced
activity in the STS when viewing pictures of faces. [37] Other studies have suggested that the
role of the STS may be more complex than simple face processing, as research has found that
individuals with ASDs have shown reduced functioning when viewing fear-provoking faces;
implying that the STS is involved in understanding the emotions of others. [25] Other areas of
the temporal lobe have also been implicated in ASDs. For instance, fMRI research suggests
that individuals with ASDs have reduced activity in the right temporoparietal junction and
other regions during imitation and observation tasks. [38]

[ edit ] Corpus callosum



Studies have found evidence of reduced size of the corpus callosum in individuals with
autism. [39] These findings suggest that there may be a link between autism and impaired
communication between brain hemispheres.

[ edit ] Environmental risk factors



A wide variety of environmental risk factors have been proposed as contributing to autism.
These include gastrointestinal or immune system abnormalities, allergies, and exposure of
children to drugs, vaccines, infection, certain foods, or heavy metals. The evidence for
these risk factors is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies. [40] The
subject remains controversial and extensive further searches for environmental factors
are underway.

[ edit ] Controversial theories



There has been a great deal of controversy over the years surrounding various theories of the
etiology of autism spectrum disorders. In the 1950s, the “ refrigerator mother theory ”
emerged as an explanation for autism. This theory was based on the idea that autistic
behaviors stem from the emotional frigidity, lack of warmth, and cold, distant, rejecting
demeanor of a child’s mother. [41] Naturally, parents of children with an autism spectrum
disorder suffered from blame, guilt, and self-doubt, especially as the theory was embraced
by the medical establishment and went largely unchallenged into the mid-1960s. While the
“refrigerator mother theory” has been rejected in the research literature, its effects
have lingered into the 21st century. Another controversial theory suggests that watching
extensive amounts of television may cause autism. This theory is largely based on research
suggesting that the increasing rates of autism in the 1970s and 1980s were due to the growth of
cable television at this time. [42] This theory has not been supported in the research
literature. Probably the biggest and most widely circulated controversial theory of autism
etiology is the “vaccine theory”. This theory suggests that autism results from brain
damage caused either by (1) the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine itself, or by (2)
thimerosal, an MMR vaccine stabilizer that is 50% ethylmercury. [43] The current scientific
consensus is that no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims, based on various
lines of evidence including the observation that the rate of autism continues to climb
despite elimination of thimerosal from routine childhood vaccines. [42] Major scientific
and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization as well as
governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC reject any role for
thimerosal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.

[ edit ] Language acquisition



Theory of mind tasks assess the ability of an individual to understand the capabilities of
others with respect to cognitive abilities and perception. Theory of mind tasks assess
attribution of epistemic mental states, intentions and motivations, and affective states.
[44] In the field of cognitive development, these tasks are usually pursued with children
over the age of three, in coordination with language development for interaction with the
researcher. These tasks are presented as behavioral tasks to the subject. Theory of mind
difficulties seem to be universal among individuals that present on the autism spectrum.
When asked to differentiate between mental and physical activities, children ages
3â€“4 had difficulty assessing which was which accurately. Additionally, they tend to
have issues understanding figurative speech or appropriate speech with respect to the
social context. [45]

As adults, only half of autistic patients are capable of speech and their linguistic
abilities are lower than normal subjects. Autistic children do not seem to acquire language
by immersion. Mean length utterance, a measure of linguistic productivity, evolves rapidly
in autistic children. A possible rationale is that they do not have enough referential
vocabulary to trigger syntax. Referential words, the understanding of what a specific word
refers to, is contrasted by relational vocabulary. Limited grammatical acquisition may be
attributed to a decreased lexicon of referential words. [22]

Linguistic and non linguistic elements evolve with isolated and specific social and
cognitive elements, with autism there is mutual interference. Gestural means of
communication is used by both non-verbal and verbal autistic children. The mother may also
have an influence on development of communication. [46]

There is a division of the Autism spectrum into three categories for patients. Individuals
with Asperger who acquire language to a normal degree but with a slight delay in the process of
acquisition. Verbal autistic children who show delay in language acquisition and
individuals who are never capable of language acquisition, they are considered nonverbal.
Difference in language acquisition may be linked to different levels of impairment at theory
of mind tasks. [22]

[ edit ] Developmental course



Although autism spectrum disorders are thought to follow two possible developmental
courses, most parents report that symptom onset occurred within the first year of life. [47]
One course of development follows a gradual course of onset in which parents tend to report
concerns in development over the first two years of life and diagnosis is made around
3â€“4 years of age. Some of the early signs of ASDs in this course include decreased
looking at faces, failure to turn when name is called, failure to show interests by showing or
pointing, and delayed pretend play (see Table 1). [48] A second course of development is
characterized by normal or near-normal development followed by loss of skills or regression
in the first 2â€“3 years. Regression may occur in a variety of domains, including
communication, social, cognitive, and self-help skills; however, the most common
regression is loss of language. [48] There continues to be a debate over the differential
outcomes based on these two developmental courses. Some studies suggest that regression is
associated with poorer outcomes and others report no differences between those with early
gradual onset and those who experience a regression period. [8] Overall, the prognosis for
individuals with autism is poor with respect to academic achievement and independent living
abilities, particularly for those who have not received early intervention. [8] However,
many individuals show improvements as they grow older. The two best predictors of favorable
outcome in autism are the absence of intellectual disability and the development of some
communicative speech prior to 5 years of age. [49] Overall, the literature stresses the
importance of early intervention in achieving positive longitudinal outcomes. [50]

months Pointing to request 9â€“12 months Not delayed at 18 months Symbolic play 14
months Absent at 18 months

[ edit ] Comorbidity with autism spectrum disorders



Autism spectrum disorders tend to be highly comorbid with other disorders. Comorbidity may
increase with age and may worsen the course of youth with ASDs and make
intervention/treatment more difficult. [51] Distinguishing between ASDs and other
diagnoses can be challenging because the traits of ASDs often overlap with symptoms of other
disorders and the characteristics of ASDs make traditional diagnostic procedures
difficult. [52] [53] In spite of these difficulties, comorbid disorders are readily
identified and tend to fall into six categories, medical conditions, intellectual
disabilities, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, behavior-related disorders, and
sensory processing disorders.

[ edit ] Medical conditions



A variety of medical conditions commonly occur in individuals with ASDs. The most common is
seizure disorder or epilepsy , which occurs in 11-39% of individuals with ASD. [54]
Typically, onset of epilepsy occurs before age five or during puberty. [55] and is more common
in females and individuals who also have comorbid mental retardation. Tic disorder is
another common medical condition seen in individuals with ASDs. While only about 6.5% of
individuals with an ASD have full blown Tourette syndrome , nearly 30% show some form of tics.
[56] Tuberous sclerosis , a medical condition in which non-malignant tumors grow in the brain
and on other vital organs, occurs in 1-4% of individuals with ASDs. [57] Sleep disorders are
also commonly reported by parents of children with ASDs, including late sleep onset, early
morning awakening, and poor sleep maintenance. [55]

[ edit ] Intellectual disabilities



Intellectual disabilities are some of the most common comorbid disorders with ASDs. Recent
estimates suggest that 40-69% of individuals with ASD have some degree of mental retardation
, [8] with females more likely to be in severe range of mental retardation. Learning
disabilities are also highly comorbid in individuals with an ASD. Approximately 25-75% of
individuals with an ASD also have some degree of learning disability, [58] although the types
of learning disability vary depending on the specific strengths and weaknesses of the
individual.

[ edit ] Anxiety disorders



A variety of anxiety disorders tend to co-occur with autism spectrum disorders, with overall
comorbidity rates of 7-84%. [8] Specific phobia is the most common comorbid condition over
the lifetime for those with ASD, with comorbidity rates of 38-63%. [51] Common phobias for
children with ASD include the fear of certain places or situations, the fear of medically
related people, places, or things, and the fear of loud noises. [59] Obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) occurs in 11-35% of individuals with ASD, with 16-81% showing features of the
disorder without a full diagnosis. While individuals with ASD exhibit rigid thinking and
compulsions, similar to OCD, the repetitive behaviors displayed in ASD (i.e., flapping,
spinning, repeating phrases) are distinct and serve alternate functions than the
repetitive behaviors displayed in OCD (i.e., checking, cleaning, counting). [51] Social
Phobia or Social Anxiety Disorder is seen in approximately 7.4% of individuals with ASD, but
is more common in higher-functioning individuals who have a desire for social interactions,
but are also aware of their social deficits. [51]

[ edit ] Mood disorders



Rates of comorbid depression in individuals with an ASD range from 4â€“58%. [60] The
presentation of depression in ASDs can depend on level of cognitive functioning, with lower
functioning children displaying more behavior issues and higher functioning children
displaying more traditional depressive symptoms. [52] Depression is thought to develop and
occur more in high-functioning individuals during adolescence, when they develop greater
insight into their differences from others. [8] Bipolar disorder may also be comorbid with an
ASD, although it is far less common than many other disorders. Rates of comorbidity vary
greatly, but tend to be around 2-8%. [59]

[ edit ] Behavior-related disorders



Deficits in ASD are often linked to behavior problems, such as difficulties following
directions, being cooperative, and doing things on other people’s terms [61] These
behavior problems are also characteristic of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and
Conduct Disorder (CD), but the reasons for the behaviors often differ. [59] For this reason,
comorbidity rates of ODD and CD range from 7% [59] to 73%. [51] Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has ASD comorbidity rates of 30-80%; however, current
diagnostic guidelines prevent diagnosing ADHD along with ASD. [59] Rather, ADHD-like
symptoms are seen to be part of the ASD diagnosis. [62]

[ edit ] Sensory processing disorders



Sensory processing disorder is also comorbid with ASD, with comorbidity rates of 42-88%.
[63] Three patterns of sensory processing difficulties are commonly seen,
hyperresponsiveness (behavioral over-reactivity to sensory stimuli),
hyporesponsiveness (behavioral under-reactivity to sensory stimuli), and
sensory-seeking (craving or fascination with certain stimuli). These patterns of
processing difficulties may be present with auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli. [64]

[ edit ] Facial characteristics



Facial Phenotypes in Prepubescent boys indicate that the face and brain develop in
coordination; researchers have found distinct abnormalities in facial characteristics in
a clinically significant percentage of boys with ASD as compared to those of normally
developing boys. The distinguishing irregularities are typically: a broader upper face and
wider eyes, a shorter middle region of the face, including the cheeks and nose, and a broader
mouth and Philtrum . [65]

[ edit ] Evidenced-based assessment



The diverse expressions of ASD symptoms pose diagnostic challenges to clinicians.
Individuals with an ASD may present at various times of development (e.g., toddler, child, or
adolescent) and symptom expression may vary over the course of development. [66]
Furthermore, clinicians are required to differentiate among the different pervasive
developmental disorders as well as other disorders such as mental retardation not
associated with a pervasive developmental disorder, specific developmental disorders
(e.g. language), and early onset schizophrenia.

Considering the unique challenges associated with diagnosing ASD, specific practice
parameters for the assessment of ASD have been published by the American Academy of
Neurology, [67] the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, [66] and a
consensus panel with representation from various professional societies. [68] The
practice parameters outlined by these societies include an initial screening of children by
general practitioners (i.e., “Level 1 screening”) and for children who fail the initial
screening, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment by experienced clinicians (i.e.
“Level 2 evaluation”). Furthermore, it has been suggested that assessments of children
with suspected ASD be evaluated within a developmental framework, include multiple
informants (e.g., parents and teachers) from diverse contexts (e.g., home and school), and
employ a multidisciplinary team of professionals (e.g., clinical psychologists,
neuropsychologists, and psychiatrists). [69]

After a child fails an initial screening, psychologists administer various psychological
assessment tools to assess for ASD. [69] Amongst these measurements, the Autism Diagnostic
Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) are
considered the “gold standards” for assessing children with autism. The ADI-R is a
semi-structured parent interview that probes for symptoms of autism by evaluating a
child’s current behavior and developmental history. The ADOS is a semistructured
interactive evaluation of ASD symptoms that is used to measure social and communication
abilities by eliciting a number of opportunities (or “presses”) for spontaneous
behaviors (e.g., eye contact) in standardized context. Various other questionnaires
(e.g., The Childhood Autism Rating Scale) and tests of cognitive functioning (e.g., The
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) are typically included in an ASD assessment battery.

[ edit ] Therapeutic interventions

Main article: Autism therapies

    Over the past two decades, there has been increasing attention to the development of
    evidenced-based interventions for young children with ASDs. Additionally, many
    unresearched alternative therapies have also been implemented (e.g., vitamin therapy
    and acupuncture). Although evidenced-based interventions for children with autism
    vary in their methods, many adopt a psychoeducational approach to enhancing cognitive,
    communication and social skills while minimizing problem behaviors. It has been argued
    that no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child’s
    needs. Available approaches include applied behaviour analysis (ABA), structured
    teaching (e.g. the TEACCH program), speech and language therapy , communication
    interventions (e.g. Picture Exchange Communication System ), social skills therapy,
    occupational therapy , and parent-communication training. [70] One of the most
    empirically supported intervention approaches is ABA, particularly in regard to early
    intensive home-based therapy. It is recommended that children receiving early
    intervention ABA therapy receive approximately 40 hours of therapy per week for about
    two years. This intensive approach underlies the UCLA Young Autism Project, originally
    developed by Lovaas and colleagues, and children in these programs have demonstrated
    gains in IQ that are maintained until adolescence. [71] [72] Although ABA therapy has a
    strong research base, other studies have found that this approach may be limited by
    diagnostic severity and IQ. [73] [74]

        ABA AND EIBI

    



Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, through the use of Applied Behavioral Analysis,
has been researched for over 40 years in its effectiveness. Most EIBI programs recognize that
all skills appropriate for each specific age are teachable and should be taught. General
curriculum areas that are addressed are language, social skills, play skills, motor skills,
pre-academic and academic skills, and independent living skills. ABA models of
intervention for preschool age include two main approaches to teaching. “Discrete Trial
Teaching” or DTT, includes multiple discrete opportunities that are presented across the
day or session. A discrete trial consists of the therapist presenting an instruction, the
child responding, and the therapist responding to that by presenting a consequence. If the
child responds incorrectly, the reinforcer is not given and the therapist will follow up with
a error correction procedure, followed by another trial. A strength of this way of teaching is
the child receives a large number of trials in a short time, allowing for a large amount of
learning opportunities. A potential weakness may be that the skills learned in this
structured setting are not easily generalized in less strict settings. “Natural
Environment Teaching” consists of maximizing naturally occurring learning
opportunities. It involves a more child-directed format that allows for the child to
initiate learning, and the therapist to recognize this and follow it by prompting the child
for a desired behavior before giving the reinforcer. [75]

All successful early intervention programs should focus on the TRIAD of impairments in ASDs.
[76] This includes: a) Joint attention and communication, b) Social understanding and
relationships, and c) Flexibility in thinking and behavior. It also includes a strong,
positive partnership with parents, siblings, and co-therapists to keep consistency
throughout the childs day. Research for more effective treatments should focus on the extent
to which E.I Programs are adapting to the child’s pattern of strengths and weaknesses and
take into account all family circumstances. The importance and effectiveness of treatment
(especially ABA formatted treatment) relies heavily on both child and family
circumstances. At the child’s level the age at entry into treatment and the severity of
impairment on a cognitive, language, and behavioral level are crucial. At the family level,
Socio-Economic status, level of income, presence of parents and proximity to outside family
and resources, organization, extent of stress of the parents and ability to work alongside
the therapist are most important for success. [77]

The Early Start Denver Program integrates applied behavior analysis with relationship and
developmental based approaches. Autistic children who participated in the Early Start
Denver Program showed significant increase in IQ, adaptive behavior and diagnostic status
when compared to community interventions. [78]

Many popular therapies including auditory integration training , GFCF diets , and chelation
are not considered evidence-based practices. Notably, research suggests that children
with ASDs on GFCF diets do not differ from control groups in terms of their symptoms. [79]

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)

An AAC user indicates a series of numbers on an eye gaze communication board in order to convey a
word.

Augmentative and alternative communication ( AAC ) is an umbrella term that encompasses the
communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with
impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by
those with a wide range of speech and language impairments , including congenital
impairments such as cerebral palsy , intellectual impairment and autism , and acquired
conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease . AAC can be a
permanent addition to a person’s communication or a temporary aid.

Modern use of AAC began in the 1950s with systems for those who had lost the ability to speak
following surgical procedures. During the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by an increasing
commitment in the West towards the inclusion of disabled individuals in mainstream society
and developing the skills required for independence, the use of manual sign language and then
graphic symbol communication grew greatly. It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge
as a field in its own right. Rapid progress in technology, including microcomputers and
speech synthesis , have paved the way for communication devices with speech output and
multiple options for access to communication for those with physical disabilities .

AAC systems are diverse: unaided communication uses no equipment and includes signing and
body language , while aided approaches use external tools and range from pictures and
communication boards to speech generating devices . The symbols used in AAC include
gestures, photographs, pictures, line drawings, letters and words, which can be used alone
or in combination. Body parts, pointers, adapted mice , or eye tracking can be used to select
target symbols directly, and switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection.
Message generation is generally much slower than spoken communication, and as a result rate
enhancement techniques may be used to reduce the number of selections required. These
techniques include “prediction”, in which the user is offered guesses of the
word/phrase being composed, and “encoding”, in which longer messages are retrieved
using a prestored code.

The evaluation of a user’s abilities and requirements for AAC will include the
individual’s motor, visual, cognitive, language and communication strengths and
weaknesses. The evaluation requires the input of family members, particularly for early
intervention. Respecting ethnicity and family beliefs are key to a family-centered and
ethnically competent approach. Studies show that AAC use does not impede the development of
speech, and may result in a modest increase in speech production. Users who have grown up with
AAC report satisfying relationships and life activities; however, they may have poor
literacy and are unlikely to be in employment.

[ edit ] Scope



Augmentative and alternative communication is used by individuals to compensate for severe
speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written
language. [1] [2] People making use of AAC include individuals with a variety of congenital
conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired
conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. [3]
Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically
between 0.1 to 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language
impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit
from AAC. [3] [4] An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC.
[5] Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking , broadcaster Roger Ebert and
poet Christopher Nolan . [6] [7] Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell
and the Butterfly , based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby
respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience. [8] [9] [10]

The field was originally called “Augmentative Communication”; the term served to
indicate that such communication systems were to supplement natural speech rather than to
replace it. The addition of “alternative” followed later, when it became clear that for
some individuals non-speech systems were their only means of communication. [11] AAC users
typically utilize a variety of aided and unaided communication strategies depending on the
communication partners and the context. [12]

[ edit ] Forms of AAC



[ edit ] Unaided AAC

Sign for “interpreter” in Quebec Sign Language

Unaided AAC systems are those that do not require an external tool, and include facial
expression, vocalizations, gestures , and sign languages and systems. [13] [14] Informal
vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural
communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. [15] More
formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For
example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language , and has been used with
children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses
including dementia , aphasia and dysarthria . [16] The benefits of gestures and pantomime are
that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and
are efficient means of communicating. [17]

In contrast, sign languages have a linguistic base and permit the expression of an unlimited
number of messages. [16] Approaches to signing can be divided into two major categories,
those that encode an existing language, and those that are languages in their own right. [18]
Signing Exact English may be considered the most widely used example of the former and
American Sign Language as a common example of the latter. [18] Signing is used alone or in
conjunction with speech to support communication with individuals with a variety of
disorders. [19] The specific hand shapes and movements of sign and gesture require an
individual to have adequate fine motor and motor planning skills. [13] [20] Sign languages
require more fine-motor coordination and are less transparent in meaning than gestural
codes such as Amer-Ind; the latter limits the number of people able to understand the
person’s communication without training. [21] [22] [23]

This speech generating device, showing available categories in a grid layout, is a high-tech
AAC aid.

An AAC aid is any “device, either electronic or non-electronic, that is used to transmit or
receive messages”; [3] such aids range from communication books to speech generating
devices . [13] Since the skills, areas of difficulty and communication needs of AAC users vary
greatly, an equally diverse range of communication aids and devices is required. [24]

[ edit ] Low-tech



Low-tech communication aids are defined as those that do not need batteries, electricity or
electronics. These are often very simple communication boards or books, from which the user
selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message. [25]
Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users may indicate the appropriate
message with a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick.
Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options .
[26]

[ edit ] High-tech

Main article: Speech generating device

High-tech AAC aids permit the storage and retrieval of electronic messages, with most
allowing the user to communicate using speech output. [27] Such devices are known as speech
generating devices (SGD) or voice output communication aids (VOCA). [28] A device’s
speech output may be digitized and/or synthesized: digitized systems play recorded words or
phrases and are generally more intelligible while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech
software that can be harder to understand but that permits the user to spell words and speak
novel messages. [28] [29]

High-tech systems may be dedicated devices developed solely for AAC, or non-dedicated
devices such as computers that run additional software to allow them to function as AAC
devices. [27] [30] They may be static or dynamic in form. Static communication devices have
symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays, which are changed manually. To increase the
vocabulary available, some static devices have multiple levels, with different words
appearing on different levels. [31] On dynamic AAC devices, the user can change the symbols
available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages. [32]
[33]

High-tech devices vary in the amount of information that they can store, as well as their size,
weight and thus their portability. [34] Access methods depend on the abilities of the user,
and may include the use of direct selection of symbols on the screen or keyboard with a body
part, pointer, adapted mice or joysticks , or indirect selection using switches and
scanning. [30] [35] Devices with voice output offer its user the advantage of more
communicative power, including the ability to initiate conversation with communication
partners who are at a distance. [36] However, they typically require programming, [36] and
tend to be unreliable. Because of the latter, low tech systems often recommended as a backup in
case of device failure. [30] [37] [38]

[ edit ] Symbols

Image: http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.19/common/images/magnify-clip.png

This Blissymbol represents the word “govern”. The inverted “v” indicates that the
symbol is a verb.

Symbols used on high and low-tech AAC systems include graphic, auditory, gestural and
textural symbols to represent objects, actions and concepts. [3] [39] For users with
literacy skills, both low and high-tech devices may use alphabet-based symbols including
individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof. [40] With low-tech devices, the
communication partner must interpret the symbols chosen whereas a high-tech device can
speak the created message aloud. [40] Several large graphic symbol sets have been developed;
these include Blissymbols , which possess linguistic characteristics such as grammatical
indicators, and the more iconic Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) which do not. [41] [42]
Tactile symbols are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a
communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or
significant intellectual impairments. [43] [44] Auditory symbols such as choices of spoken
words or Morse code can also be integrated with assistive technology for the visually
impaired. [43] [45] [46]

The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend
on an individual’s preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills.
[43] [44] [47]

[ edit ] Access and selection methods

See also: Switch Access Scanning



Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Eyegaze.jpg/220px-Eyegaze.jpg

Image: http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.19/common/images/magnify-clip.png

A subject uses eye-gaze to indicate choices on a transparent letter-based communication
board. This is a form of “Direct Selection”.

Technological advances have dramatically increased the types of selection methods
available for individuals with communication impairments. [48] In “Direct
Selection”, the selection is made by pointing to the desired symbol using a finger or an
alternative pointer, such as eye gaze, a head stick, head- or eye-controlled mouse. To
accommodate motor control difficulties some users use alternative activation strategies;
for example in “timed activation”, the user maintains selection of the symbol for a
predetermined period of time until it is recognized by the system. With the “release
activation”, the selection of the item is only made when the person releases contact from
the display. [49]

Direct activation of an AAC system is generally the first choice of access method as it is
faster and cognitively easier. [50] Those unable to do so may use indirect selection or
“scanning”. In this method, items displayed for selection are scanned; the scanning may
be visual using indicators such as lights, highlighting, and/or contrasting borders, or
auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device. When the desired
message is reached, the AAC user indicates the choice using an alternative selection
technique such as a switch , vocalization or gesture. [51] [52] Several different patterns
for switch access scanning are available: in “circular scanning”, the items are
displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time. It is often introduced first to children or
beginning AAC users because it is the easiest to understand. In “linear scanning”, items
are organized in rows and are scanned one at a time until a choice is made. Although more
demanding than circular scanning, it is still easy to learn. Finally, in “group-item
scanning”, items are grouped and the groups scanned consecutively. Once a particular
group is selected, items within the group are scanned. One of the most common group-item
strategies is row-column scanning in which each row forms a group. The rows of items are
scanned and when a row is selected, the items in the row are scanned one at a time until a message
is selected. [51]

There are three main selection control techniques in scanning. In “automatic
scanning”, the scan proceeds at a pre-determined speed and pattern until the user selects
an item. In “inverse scanning”, the switch is held down to advance the scan, and released
to choose the desired iem. In “step scanning”, the AAC user activates one switch to move
the indicator through the items, and another switch to select the item. [51]

[ edit ] Vocabulary organization

See also: Speech Generating Devices: Vocabulary

Vocabulary organization refers to the way pictures, words, phrases, and sentences are
displayed on the communication system. [53] In general, the goal is to facilitate efficient
and effective communication, especially when the individual’s AAC system contains a
large number of symbols. [23]

A static digitized speech communication device with a book reading (activity-based)
overlay

Communication books and devices are often presented in a grid format; [54] the vocabulary
items displayed within them may be organized by spoken word order, frequency of usage or
category. In the Fitzgerald Key organization, symbols from different semantic and
syntactic classes are organized in groups from left to right to facilitate sentence
construction. [55] Since research has shown that children and adults use a small number of
words frequently, [56] [57] in a core-fringe vocabulary organization, the words and
messages that are communicated most frequently appear on a “main page”. The fringe
vocabularyâ€”words and messages used more rarely and that are specific to an
individualâ€”appear on other pages. [58] Symbols may also be organized by category,
grouping people, places, feelings, foods, drinks, and action words together. [54] Another
form of grid organization groups vocabulary according to specific activities. [59] Each
display contains symbols for the people, places, objects, feelings, actions, and other
relevant vocabulary items for a specific activity or routine. [60]

Speech generating device using a visual scene display, accessed using a head mouse

Visual scene displays are a different method of organizing and presenting symbols. These are
depictions of events, people, objects, and related actions in a picture, photograph, or
virtual environment representing a situation, place, or specific experience. [61] [62]
They are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary that is associated with
specific activities or routines. For example, a photo of a child’s room may be included in
the child’s AAC system. Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols
for communication. [60] Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid
displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use. [48] [63]

[ edit ] Rate enhancement strategies

See also: Speech Generating Devices: Rate enhancement strategies

Augmentative and alternative communication is typically much slower than speech, [64] with
users generally producing 8â€“10 words per minute. [48] Rate enhancement strategies
can increase the user’s rate of output to around 12â€“15 words per minute, [48] and as a
result enhance the efficiency of communication. There are two main options for increasing
the rate of communication: encoding and prediction. [64]

Encoding is a technique permitting an AAC user to produce an entire word, sentence or phrase
using only one or two activations of their AAC system. [64] In numeric, alpha-numeric, and
letter encoding (also known as abbreviation-expansion), words and sentences are coded as
sequences of letters and numbers. For example, typing “HH” may retrieve “Hello, how
are you?”. [65] In iconic encoding strategies, such as Semantic compaction , icons
(picture symbols) are combined in a sequence to produce words or phrases. [65]

Prediction is a rate enhancement strategy in which the device attempts to predict the letter,
word or phrase being written by the user. The user can then select the correct prediction
without needing to write the full word. Word prediction software may determine the words
predicted based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices
of the user, or grammatical suitability. [64] [65]

[ edit ] Assessment and system implementation



I stiffened my body and put my left foot out again, for the third time. I drew one side of the
letter. I drew half the other side… I set my teeth so hard that I nearly pierced my lower lip.
But â€“ I drew it â€“ the letter ‘A’… Shaky, with awkward, wobbly sides and a
very uneven centre line… I had done it! I had started â€“ the thing that was to give my
mind its chance of expressing itself. True, I couldn’t speak with my lips, but now I would
speak through something more lasting than spoken words â€“ written words. That one
letter, scrawled on the floor with a broken bit of yellow chalk gripped between my toes, was my
road to a new world, my key to mental freedom. The poet and author Christy Brown describes his
communication breakthrough at 5 years in the book My Left Foot . [66]

An evaluation of an individual’s abilities, limitations and communication needs is
necessary to select appropriate AAC techniques. The purpose of the assessment is to identify
potential AAC approaches that can bridge discrepancies between a potential user’s
current communication and their present and future communication needs. [67] AAC
evaluations are often conducted by specialized teams which may include a speech-language
pathologist , occupational therapist , rehabilitation engineer , physiotherapist , social
worker and a physician . [68] [69] Users, family members and teachers are also key members of
the decision making team. [69] [70] Sensitivity to and respect of cultural diversity
contributes to ongoing family involvement and to the selection of the most appropriate AAC
system. [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] For members of some cultural groups the presence of an AAC
device increases the visibility of disability and is thus viewed as stigmatizing. [72] [76]
[77]

A user’s motor abilities, communication skills and needs, cognition and vision are
assessed in order to determine the most appropriate match to a communication system. [69]
Depending on the individual’s physical status, recommendations of an alternative access
method, a change in seating/positioning, a mounting system and/or communication aid
adaptations may be needed. For example, someone with spastic arm movements may require a key
guard on top of the keyboard or touchscreen to reduce the selection of non-target items. The
person’s needs and abilities determine the symbols chosen and their organization, with
the goal being that the communication system can be used as efficiently as possible in
different contexts, with different communication partners, and for different social
purposes. [6] [68] Researcher Janice Light identified four social purposes of
communicative interaction in AAC: the expression of needs and wants to a listener, the
transfer of information as in more general conversation, the development of social
closeness through such things as jokes and cheering, and finally social etiquette practices
such as “please” and “thank you”. These four purposes vary in terms of the relative
importance of the content, rate, duration and the focus of the interaction. It is important
that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family.
[78] [79] In Western cultures, professionals may see a communication device as helping to
promote an individual’s self-determination , i.e., the ability to make one’s own
decisions and choices. [80] However, cultural and religious factors may affect the degree to
which individual autonomy is a valued construct, [81] [82] and influence family attitudes
towards AAC. [82]

Training can help the user make use of their AAC system to communicate effectively with
others, to control their environment through communication, and to make choices, decisions
and mistakes. [83] Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated
areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. Linguistic competence refers to
language skills in the person’s native language as well as the linguistic code of the symbol
system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of
the tool of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect
knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations
required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC.
An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in
these areas. [84] [85]

Communication partners may also require training to notice and consistently interpret the
communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly because there is a
danger that learned helplessness can be the result of repeated failure to communicate
successfully. [86] Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style
that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as
initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions,
making commands or adding new information. [87] [88] Young AAC users benefit from rich
language and literacy experiences to foster vocabulary development, discourse skills, and
phonological awareness , all of which supports successful literacy learning. [89]
Communication partners are encouraged to provide augmented input with the child, such as
signing or pointing to symbols and codes as they communicate, including using the
individual’s communication system themselves. [84] They also benefit from focussed and
explicit reading instruction. [90] [91]

[ edit ] Outcomes



[ edit ] Speech



Several reviews have found that the use of AAC does not impede the development of speech in
individuals with autism or developmental disabilities, and in fact may result in modest
gains being observed. [92] [93] A 2006 research review of 23 AAC intervention studies found
gains in speech production in 89% of the cases studied, with the remainder showing no change.
[93] A descriptive review looking specifically at Picture Exchange Communication System
(PECS) intervention studies found that several studies reported an increase in speech,
often during later phases, while one noted little or no effect. [94]

Researchers hypothesize that using an AAC device relieves the pressure of having to speak,
allowing the individual to focus on communication, and that the reduction in psychological
stress makes speech production easier. [95] Others speculate that in the case of speech
generating devices, the model of spoken output leads to an increase in speech production.
[96]

[ edit ] Language and literacy



Language and literacy have far reaching effects as they facilitate self-expression and
social interaction in a variety of settings. [97] Furthermore, literacy fosters
independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities. [98]
Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language
skills such as vocabulary knowledge, length of sentences, syntax , and impaired pragmatic
skills. [89] These delays may be due in part to the fact that expressive language is limited by
more than the children’s own language knowledge. Unlike speaking children, children who
use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system, and don’t select the content available
on the device. These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities.
[99] Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically
developing 7â€“8 year old. [100] Cognitive, language and learning delays contribute
to difficulty with literacy development, [89] but environmental factors also play a role.
The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing
material at home as well as in school during childhood. [101] Studies have shown that many
children who use AAC have literacy experiences that are reduced quality, quantity, and
opportunity at home and at school as compared to children without disabilities. [98] [102]
[103] Research suggests that with explicit reading instruction, AAC users can develop good
literacy skills. [90] [91]

[ edit ] Employment



According to a 1997 U.S. Census Bureau report less than 10% of severely disabled individuals
were employed. Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in
educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs. [104] [105]
Factors that have been found to be related to employment are a strong work ethic and access to
AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills. [106]
Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued
employment include access to AAC, support from employers, governmental programs and
others. [107] Employers of AAC users report that skills in time management , problem solving ,
communication, technology and a good education are important to employers. [108]

[ edit ] Quality of life



Several studies of young adults who had used AAC since childhood report a generally good
quality of life, though few lived independently, or were in paid employment. [104] [109] The
young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC
approaches. [104] [110] More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better
quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and
community support, and excellent AAC services. [104] [109] [111] Poorer outcomes were
related to lack of access to appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with
technology and negative attitudes. [104] [111]

[ edit ] Specific groups of AAC users



[ edit ] Cerebral palsy



Cerebral palsy is a term referring to a non-progressive developmental neuromotor disorder
with a upper motor neuron lesion origin. [112] Depending on the location of the brain lesion,
individuals with cerebral palsy can have a wide variety of gross and fine motor challenges,
including different forms and areas of the body affected. Fine motor planning, control and
coordination are often affected. [113] Dysarthria , a speech disorder resulting from
neurological damage to the motor-speech system, occurs in an estimated 31% to 88% of those
with cerebral palsy. Such individuals may require AAC support for communication.
Approximately one half to one third have some degree of intellectual impairment, and visual
and hearing problems are also common. [114] [115] Gross and fine motor challenges are often of
particular concern in accessing an AAC device. [113] Appropriate seating and positioning
are important to facilitate optimum stability and movement. [116] Extensive motor training
and practice may be required to develop efficient AAC access and use. [117]

[ edit ] Intellectual impairment

Image: http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.19/common/images/magnify-clip.png

Phrases can be recorded onto simple switch-operated AAC devices by a user or carer so that the
recording is played when the switch is pressed.

Individuals with intellectual impairments face challenges in developing communication
skills, including problems with generalization (the transfer of learned skills into daily
activities). They may lack communication opportunities in their daily lives, and
responsive communicators who understand their communication methods. [118] AAC
intervention for this population emphasizes partner training as well as opportunities for
integrated, natural communication. [118] Studies have shown that appropriate use of AAC
techniques with children and adults with intellectual impairments can enhance
communication skills, [119] [120] increase participation in activities, [121]
choice-making, [122] and even influence the perceptions and stereotypes of communication
partners. [121]

While most individuals with intellectual disabilities do not have concomitant behavioural
issues , problems in this area are typically more prevalent in this population than others.
[123] AAC approaches may be used as part of teaching functional communication skills to
non-speaking individuals as an alternative to “acting out” for the purpose of exerting
independence, taking control, or informing preferences. [118]

[ edit ] Autism



Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and
communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular
difficulty acquiring expressive communication skills. [92] [124] Children with autism
have been found to have strong visual processing skills, making them good candidates for an
AAC approach. [125] AAC intervention in this population is directed towards the linguistic
and social abilities of the child, [126] including providing the child with a concrete means
of communication, as well as facilitating the development of interactional skills. [92]
[127]

AAC systems for this population generally begin with communication boards and/or object or
picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). [127] A 2009
descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most
individuals with autism, provides communication to those with little or no functional
speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging
behaviours . [94] A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture
exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease
and speed of acquisition of each system was similar. [128]

Rhonda McEwen(left) with autistic children from Toronto’s Beverly School using tactile
technology

Rhonda McEwen, Ph.D. , is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto [129] . McEwen
received an MBA degree in Information Technology from City University London , England,
holds an M.Sc. degree in Telecommunications from the University of Colorado , and earned a
Ph.D. from the University of Toronto in Information. [130] On December 3rd, 2010 McEwen
presented at the Rogers Tablife TO conference in Canada. This is an event sponsored by Rogers
Media with the purpose of exploring how current touch technologies are changing the way we
work, live and play [131] . Her lecture pertained to a case study on the effects of multisensory
devices on nonverbal students. [132] . She is currently the principal investigator of
research concerning the educational use of haptic technology and children with
communication disorders – specifically those diagnosed with Autism [133] . Her work,
titled â€œTouch Technologies in the Classroomâ€� [134] is the first of its kind to
study the impacts of tablet computers on the development of the children’s communication
skills. [135] . iPad devices particularly are featured in the research, with application
programs such as ‘Proloquo2Go’ used to gauge the children’s involvement and any
consequent progress. Characteristics such as the ease of accessibility of the touchscreen
device, the interactive nature of the programs and the speech recognition are all aspects
that amount to conclusive evaluation. [136] To date, these technologies are indicating
facilitated communication for nonverbal children, as positive feedback is being reported
from staff, families, and the children themselves. [137] In fact, the University of Toronto
reports that this “two-year study…found that within six weeks the devices boosted
kidsâ€™ attention spans, raised their ability to identify pictured objects by 45 to 60
per cent, and improved communication skills in these mostly nonverbal children by 20 per
cent.” [138] . However, it is important to consider that this is a still a relatively new
investigation as well as a longitudinal study ; it may take many years before definite results
can prove that tablet devices absolutely assist in developing complete communication
skills of all children diagnosed with autism. [139] .

[ edit ] Developmental dyspraxia



Developmental dyspraxia (or apraxia of speech) is a childhood motor speech disorder
involving impairments in the motor control of speech production. [140] The speech of a child
with developmental dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication
needs cannot be met. A child with developmental dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of
frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional
speech therapy to improve speech production. [141]

A wide variety of AAC systems have been used with children with developmental dyspraxia.
[142] Manual signs or gestures are frequent introduced to these children, and can include the
use of fingerspelling alongside speech. Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in
articulation. [141] Aided AAC systems typically include communication boards and speech
generating devices. [142] A multimodal approach is often used, with several AAC approaches
introduced so that the child can take advantage of the most effective method for a particular
situation. [141]

[ edit ] Traumatic brain injury



Traumatic brain injury can result in severe motor speech disorders; dysarthria is the most
common such disorder, accounting for roughly a third of all cases. [143] Depending on the
stage of recovery, AAC intervention may involve identifying consistent communication
signals, the facilitation of reliable yes/no responses to questions, and the ability to
express basic needs and answer questions. Individuals who do not recover natural speech to a
degree sufficient to meet their communication needs typically suffer from severe
impairments related to cognition. [144] Difficulties with memory and learning new skills
may influence AAC choices; well-established competencies such as spelling may be more
effective than AAC systems that require navigation through multiple pages to access
information. [144]

[ edit ] Aphasia



Aphasia is the result of damage to the brain’s language centres affecting production,
comprehension, or both, and can cause severe, chronic language impairment. [145]
Individuals with aphasia often communicate using a combination of speech, gestures, and
aided communication; the proportion of each may change as the person recovers, and depends on
the context and the individual’s skills. [146]

Depending on their language and cognitive skills, those with aphasia may use AAC
interventions such as communication and memory books, drawing, photography, written
words, speech generating devices and keyboards. [145] Visual scene displays have been used
on communication devices with adults who have chronic, severe aphasia; these feature photos
of people, places or events that are meaningful to the individual and facilitative of
communicative interaction. [145] Approaches such as “Supported Conversation for Adults
with Aphasia” train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words,
providing written choices, drawing, and using items such as photographs and maps to help the
individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation. [147] [148]

[ edit ] Locked-in syndrome



Strokes that occur in the brainstem may cause profound deficits, including locked-in
syndrome , [149] in which cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but
all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost. [150] Most people affected by this type
of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate, since few recover intelligible speech or
functional voice. [151] The AAC strategies used vary with the individual’s preferences
and motor capabilities which may change over time. As eye movements are most likely to be
preserved, eye blinks are frequently used for communication. [150] Low-tech alphabet
boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic
communication. Partner-assisted scanning may be used, in which the AAC user signals when the
desired letter is named by a communication partner. When vertical and horizontal eye
movements are functional, a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks
at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner. [150]
Individuals with locked-in syndrome have difficulty using high-tech devices due to issues
with motor control , vision, memory, alertness and linguistic ability. [150] In particular,
a voluntary, reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a
device, such as head, jaw, hand or finger movements. [150] In some individuals, intensive
practice, even long after the initial stroke, has been shown to increase the accuracy and
consistency of head movements, [151] which can be used to access a communication device.
[150]

[ edit ] Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Stephen Hawking , a noted physicist with ALS who uses AAC

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a progressive
condition which leads to weakness and eventual paralysis . Approximately 75% of people with
ALS are unable to speak by the time of their death. [152] In a procedure known as voice banking,
people with ALS may digitally record words and phrases while still able to do so, for later
inclusion in a communication device. [153] AAC systems used typically change over time
depending on severity of speech impairment, physical status, and the individual’s
communication needs. [154] Use of augmentative communication strategies generally begins
when speaking rate drops to 100 words per minute. [155] In the early stages, AAC may consist of
using an alphabet board to cue the listener to the first letter of the word being spoken, and may
be used with those less familiar with the individual. In the later stages, AAC often becomes
the main communicative method, although familiar conversation partners may still
understand some spoken words. [156] Since cognition and vision are typically unaffected in
ALS, writing-based systems are preferred to graphic symbols, as they allow the unlimited
expression of all words in a language. [156]

The method of access to a communication device depends on the type and severity of the disease.
In the spinal form of ALS, the limbs are affected from the onset of the disease; in these cases a
head mouse or eye tracking access may be used initially. [157] In the bulbar form, speech is
affected before the limbs; here handwriting and typing on keyboard-style devices are
frequently the first forms of AAC. [158] AAC users may change access methods as the disease
progresses. Low-tech systems, such as eye gazing or partner assisted scanning, are used in
situations when electronic devices are unavailable (for example, during bathing) and in the
final stages of the disease. [158] [158]

[ edit ] Parkinson’s disease

Keyboard text-to-speech generating device for literate users with adequate fine motor
control

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological condition [159] in which dysarthria
may develop later in the progression of the disease. [160] Some individuals eventually lose
all functional speech. [161] AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support
natural speech. [161] A portable amplifier, for example, may be used to increase the volume of
speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter
of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for
the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if
necessary. [161] In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual
selection display may be preferred. [161] High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating
devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by
the tremor typical of the disease. [161] Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson’s disease
include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their
problems with spoken communication. [159] [162]

[ edit ] Multiple sclerosis



Dysarthria is the most common communication problem in individuals with multiple sclerosis
(MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon.
[163] [164] Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence
of intention tremor , and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual
impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning
systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as
they are typed. [165]

[ edit ] Dementia



Dementia is an acquired, chronic, cognitive impairment characterized by deficits in memory
and other cognitive domains. [145] [166] Communication impairments are partly attributed
to memory deficits, [166] and AAC intervention may be used to compensate for deficits and to
capitalize on the person’s strengths, such as the ability to recognize material they
cannot recall. [167] Low-tech devices are generally preferred, such as memory books that
include autobiographical information, daily schedules, photographs, and reminders or
labels. [167] Several studies have shown positive outcomes in the amount of on-topic
conversation and the length of interaction with these approaches. [168] [169] [170] The
gains were maintained four months after the training in the use of the memory aids had ceased.
[170] High-tech devices with voice output have been found to be less effective; in one study
devices resulted in limited topic elaboration/initiation, reduced output and heightened
distraction. [166] AAC is also used to enhance the comprehension of those with dementia. The
use of augmented listening strategies, such as identifying topics of conversation with
pictures, improves the conversational skills of individuals with dementia. [167]

A page from a 1620 Spanish treatise on finger spelling

The history of AAC can be traced to the days of classical Rome and Greece , with the first
recorded use of augmentative strategies with the deaf . [8] [171] The use of manual alphabets
and signs was recorded in Europe from the 16th century, as was the gestural system of Hand Talk
used by Native Americans to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups.
[8] [171] The first known widely available communication aid was a letter and word-based
communication board developed for, and with, F. Hall Roe, who had cerebral palsy. This
communication board was distributed in the 1920s by a men’s group in Minneapolis . [11]

The Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom
in the early 1960s.

The modern era of AAC began in the 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several
societal changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication
and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation
and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. [171] [172] In the early
years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with
individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. [173] It was typically only employed after
traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech
intervention to those who might be able to learn to speak. [171] [172] Individuals with
intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they
did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. [121] [172] The main systems used were manual
signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric
communication device in the form of a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient
Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom. [11] [171]

From the 1960s onward, sign language increased in acceptance and use in the Deaf community ,
and AAC also came to be viewed as acceptable for those with other diagnoses. [172] [173] Manual
sign languages, such as Makaton , were advocated for those with both hearing and cognitive
impairments, and later for those with intellectual impairment or autism with normal
hearing. [171] [172] [174] Research into whether primates could learn to sign or use graphic
symbols spurred further interest the use of AAC with those with cognitive impairments. [171]
[173] [174] The use of Amer-Ind hand signals opened the field to AAC techniques specifically
for adult users. [171]

Blissymbols were first used in Canada in 1971 to provide communication to those not able to use
traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. [11] [171] With
improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the
Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a
screen or strip of paper. By the end of the 1970s, communication devices were being
commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. [11] Countries
such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for
those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and
research expertise. [171]

The late 1970s and 1980s saw a massive increase of AAC-related research, publications, and
training as well the first national and international conferences. [171] The International
Society for Alternative and Augmentative Communication (ISAAC) was founded in 1983; its
members included clinicians, teachers, rehabilitation engineers, researchers, and AAC
users themselves. The organization has since played an important role in developing the
field through its peer-reviewed journal, conferences, national chapters and its focus on
AAC in developing countries . [11] [171] AAC became an area of professional specialization; a
1981 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association position paper, for example,
recognized AAC as a field of practice for speech-language pathologists. [175] At the same
time, AAC users and family members played an increasing prominent role in the development of
knowledge of AAC through their writing and presentations, by serving on committees and
founding advocacy organizations. [171]

“Knowing that most of y’all do not know the HandiVoice, I will describe it…It was
operated with a numeric keyboard…Each word, or sentence, or phrase, or phoneme was stored
and accessed by a three digit code, for example, “hello” was 010…It took three codes to
say “Rick”, that was nine numbers. Now if you think that’s bad, let’s go for the simple
sentence, “Hello, this is Rick Creech speaking.” This would have taken fifteen 3 digit
codes, for a total of forty-five numbers. Looking back, I am not surprised that very few
professionals thought a person could successfully use the HandiVoice 120. But I did. I did,
because being able to communicate with people was so empowering to me.” Rick Creech
describes the HandiVoice 120 speech generating device, which he received in 1977. [176]

From the 1980s, improvements in technology led to a greatly increased number, variety, and
performance of commercially available communication devices, and a reduction in their size
and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on
communication devices. [171] [172] Speech output possibilities included digitized and
synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian,
Spanish, Swedish and Ewe . [171] AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a
balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the
person’s daily life, and greater involvement of the family. [172] Increasingly,
individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
Parkinson’s disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services. [171]
In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to
profound intellectual impairments began to be served. [172] Courses on AAC were developed
for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were
written to support students, clinicians and parents. [171]

The 1990s brought a focus on greater independence for people with disabilities, and more
inclusion in mainstream society . [171] In schools, students with special needs were placed
in regular classrooms rather than segregated settings, which led to an increased use of AAC as
a means of improving student participation in class. [172] Interventions became more
collaborative and naturalistic, taking place in the classroom with the teacher, rather than
in a therapy room. [171] [172] Facilitated communication â€“ a method by which a
facilitator physically and emotionally supports a person with severe communication needs
as they type on a keyboard or letter board â€“ received wide attention in the media and in
the field. The question of the authorship made the approach controversial; most of the
subsequent research indicated that the facilitators were unknowingly influencing the
messages typed. [171] [174] As a result, professional organizations and AAC researchers and
clinicians have not typically accepted facilitated communication. [174]

Rapid progress in hardware and software development continued, including projects funded
by the European Community . The first commercially available dynamic screen speech
generating devices were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was
becoming available in more languages. Software programs were developed that allowed the
computer-based production of communication boards. [171] [172] High-tech devices have
continued to reduce in size and weight, [172] while increasing accessibility and
capacities. Modern communication devices can also enable users to access the internet and
some can be used as environmental control devices for independent access of TV, radio,
telephone etc. [177]

Future directions for AAC focus on improving device interfaces, reducing the cognitive and
linguistic demands of AAC, and the barriers to effective social interaction. [48] AAC
researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more
appealing aesthetically, with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to
use. [178] [179] The rapid advances in smartphone and tablet computer technologies has the
potential to radically change the availability of economical, accessible, flexible
communication devices; however, the user interfaces are needed that meet the various
physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users. [179] [180] Android and other open source
operating systems, provide opportunities for small communities, such as AAC, to develop the
accessibility features and software required. [180] Other promising areas of development
include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition
technologies that interpret body motions, or electrodes measuring brain activity, and the
automatic transcription of dysarthric speech using speech recognition systems. [48]
Utterance-based systems, in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the
speed of communication exchange, are also in development. [48] Similarly, research has
focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for
specific interactions. [48] [181] Natural language generation techniques have been
investigated, [182] [183] including the use of logs of past conversations with
conversational partners, [184] data from a user’s schedule [182] and from real-time
Internet vocabulary searches, [48] [185] as well as information about location from global
positioning systems and other sensors. [48] [182] [186] However, despite the frequent focus
on technological advances in AAC, practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the
communication needs of the AAC users: “The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in
technology, but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for the
enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex
communication needs”. [179]

Sensory Processing Disorder

Posted by: adifferentworld | April 1, 2012 | No Comment | From Wikipedia, the free
encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search

Sensory processing disorder or SPD is a Neurological disorder causing difficulties with
taking in, processing and responding to sensory information about the environment and from
within the own body ( visual , auditory , tactile , olfaction , gustatory , vestibular and
proprioception ).

For those with SPD, sensory information may be sensed and perceived in a way that is different
from most other people. Unlike blindness or deafness , sensory information can be received by
people with SPD, the difference is that information is often registered, interpreted and
processed differently by the brain. The result can be unusual ways of responding or behaving,
finding things harder to do. Difficulties may typically present as difficulties planning
and organising, problems with doing the activities of everyday life (self care, work and
leisure activities), and for some with extreme sensitivity, sensory input may result in
extreme avoidance of activities, agitation, distress, fear or confusion. [1]

The term SPD is now often used (though not without controversy) instead of the earlier term
sensory integration dysfunction which was originally used by occupational therapist A.
Jean Ayres as part of her theory that deficits in the processing and interpretation of
sensation from the body and the environment could lead to sensorimotor and learning problems
in children. The theory is widely acknowledged, but also has generated tremendous
controversy.

Some state that sensory processing disorder is a distinct diagnosis, while others argue that
differences in sensory responsiveness are features of other diagnoses. [2] SPD is not
recognized in any standard medical manuals such as the ICD-10 [3] or the DSM-IV-TR . [4] The
committee that prepares the DSM-5 has requested that additional studies are done before the
disorder can be recognized. [2] On the other hand, SPD is an accepted diagnosis in Stanley
Greenspan â€™s Diagnostic Manual for Infancy and Early Childhood and as Regulation
Disorders of Sensory Processing part of the The Zero to Threeâ€™s Diagnostic
Classification . [5]

SPD is often associated with a range of neurological, psychiatric, behavioral and language
disorders. [6]

There is no known cure; however, there are many treatments available. [ citation needed ]

Initially the term traditionally used for children and adults with sensory processing
difficulties was Sensory Integration Dysfunction (SID).

A new nosology (way of naming and classifying) has been proposed by Lucy J. Miller, Ph.D., OTR
and colleagues. The new terms are meant to increase understanding between Occupational
Therapists and other professionals who frequently encounter SID and physicians and other
health professionals who approach sensory integration dysfunction from a more
neurobiological vantage.

This understanding is critical as physicians are responsible for diagnosing SPD, which is a
necessary step in accessing reimbursement (eventually from insurance companies) for
professional services to treat SPD.

    Sensory Processing Dysfunction is now being used as a global umbrella term that includes
    all forms of this disorder, including three primary diagnostic groups:

    - Type I – Sensory Modulation Disorder

    

    - Type II – Sensory Based Motor Disorder

    

    - Type III – Sensory Discrimination Disorder

    



Type I – Sensory Modulation Disorder (SMD). Over, or under responding to sensory stimuli or
seeking sensory stimulation. This group may include a fearful and/or anxious pattern,
negative and/or stubborn behaviors, self-absorbed behaviors that are difficult to engage
or creative or actively seeking sensation.

Type II – Sensory Based Motor Disorder (SBMD). Shows motor output that is disorganized as a
result of incorrect processing of sensory information affecting postural control
challenges and/or dyspraxia .

Type III – Sensory Discrimination Disorder (SDD). Sensory discrimination or incorrect
processing of sensory information. Incorrect processing of visual or auditory input, for
example, may be seen in inattentiveness, disorganization, and poor school performance.

[ edit ] Sensory modulation



Sensory modulation refers to a complex central nervous system process by which neural
messages that convey information about the intensity, frequency, duration, complexity,
and novelty of sensory stimuli are adjusted.

Behaviorally, this is manifested in the tendency to generate responses that are
appropriately graded in relation to incoming sensations, neither underreacting nor
overreacting to them.

[ edit ] Sensory modulation problems

    

    - Sensory registration problems – This refers to the process by which the central
    nervous system attends to stimuli. This usually involves an orienting response.
    Sensory registration problems are characterized by failure to notice stimuli that
    ordinarily are salient to most people.

    

    - Sensory defensiveness – A condition characterized by over-responsivity in one or
    more systems.

    

    - Gravitational insecurity – A sensory modulation condition in which there is a
    tendency to react negatively and fearfully to movement experiences, particularly
    those involving a change in head position and movement backward or upward through space.

    



(Case-Smith, (2005)

[ edit ] Hyposensitivities and hypersensitivities



Sensory integration disorders vary between individuals in their characteristics and
intensity. Some people are so mildly afflicted, the disorder is barely noticeable, while
others are so impaired they have trouble with daily functioning.

Children can be born hypersensitive or hyposensitive to varying degrees and may have trouble
in one sensory modality, a few, or all of them. Hypersensitivity is also known as sensory
defensiveness . Examples of hypersensitivity include feeling pain from clothing rubbing
against skin, an inability to tolerate normal lighting in a room, a dislike of being touched
(especially light touch) and discomfort when one looks directly into the eyes of another
person.

Hyposensitivity is characterized by an unusually high tolerance for environmental
stimuli. A child with hyposensitivity might appear restless and seek sensory stimulation.

In treating sensory dysfunctions, a “just right” challenge is used: giving the child
just the right amount of challenge to motivate him and stimulate changes in the way the system
processes sensory information but not so much as to make him shut down or go into sensory
overload.

The “just right” challenge is absent if the activity and the child’s perception of
activity do not match. In addition, deep pressure is often calming for children who have
sensory dysfunctions. It is recommended that therapists use a variety of tactile materials,
a quiet, subdued voice, and slow, linear movements, tailoring the approach to the child’s
unique sensory needs.

While occupational therapy sessions focus on increasing a child’s ability to tolerate a
variety of sensory experiences, both the activities and environment should be assessed for a
“just right” fit with the child. Overwhelming environmental stimuli such as flickering
fluorescent lighting and bothersome clothing tags should be eliminated whenever possible
to increase the child’s comfort and ability to engage productively. Meanwhile, the
occupational therapist and parents should jointly create a “sensory diet,” a term
coined by occupational therapist Anna Jean Ayres .

The sensory diet is a schedule of daily activities that gives the child the sensory fuel his or
her or hir body needs to get into an organized state and stay there. According to SI theory,
rather than just relying on individual treatment sessions, ensuring that a carefully
designed program of sensory input throughout the day is implemented at home and at school can
create profound, lasting changes in the child’s nervous system.

Parents can help their child by realizing that play is an important part of their child’s
development. Therapy involves working with an occupational therapist and the child will
engage in activities that provide vestibular, proprioceptive and tactile stimulation.
Therapy is individualized to meet the child’s specific needs for development. Emphasis is
put on automatic sensory processes in the course of a goal-directed activity. The children
are engaged in therapy as play which may include activities such as: finger painting, using
Play-Doh type modeling clay, swinging, playing in bins of rice or water, climbing, etc.

[ edit ] Relationship to other disorders



[ edit ] Autistic spectrum disorders and difficulties of sensory processing



Sensory processing disorder is a common comorbidity with autism spectrum disorders . [7]
Although responses to sensory stimuli are more common and prominent in autistic children and
adults, there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other
developmental disorders. [8] Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for
example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud
noises) or for seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). [9] The responses may be more
common in children: a pair of studies found that autistic children had impaired tactile
perception while autistic adults did not. [10]

[ edit ] Other disorders



The neuroscientist David Eagleman has proposed that SPD may be a form of synesthesia , a
perceptual condition in which the senses are blended. [11] . Specifically, Eagleman
suggests that instead of a sensory input “connecting to [a person's] color area [in the
brain], it’s connecting to an area involving pain or aversion or nausea”. [12]

Some argue that sensory related disorders may be misdiagnosed as attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but they can coexist, as well as emotional problems,
aggressiveness and speech-related disorders such as aphasia . Sensory processing, they
argue, is foundational, like the roots of a tree, and gives rise to a myriad of behaviors and
symptoms such as hyperactivity and speech delay .

For example, a child with an under-responsive vestibular system may need extra input to his
“motion sensor” in order to achieve a state of quiet alertness; to get this input, the
child might fidget or run around, appearing ostensibly to be hyperactive, when in fact, he
suffers from a sensory related disorder

Researchers have described a treatable inherited sensory overstimulation disorder that
meets diagnostic criteria for both attention deficit disorder and sensory integration
dysfunction. [13]

[ edit ] Sensory integration therapy

Main article: Sensory integration therapy

Several therapies have been developed to treat SID. [14] Some of these treatments (for
example, sensorimotor handling) have a questionable rationale and no empirical evidence.
Other treatments (for example, prism lenses, physical exercise, and auditory integration
training ) have had studies with small positive outcomes, but few conclusions can be made
about them due to methodological problems with the studies. [15] Although replicable
treatments have been described and valid outcome measures are known, gaps exist in knowledge
related to sensory integration dysfunction and therapy. [16] Empirical support is limited,
therefore systematic evaluation is needed if these interventions are used. [17]

The main form of sensory integration therapy is a type of occupational therapy that places a
child in a room specifically designed to stimulate and challenge all of the senses.

    During the session, the therapist works closely with the child to provide a level of
    sensory stimulation that the child can cope with, and encourage movement within the
    room. Sensory integration therapy is driven by four main principles:

    - Just Right Challenge (the child must be able to successfully meet the challenges that
    are presented through playful activities)

    

    - Adaptive Response (the child adapts his behavior with new and useful strategies in
    response to the challenges presented)

    

    - Active Engagement (the child will want to participate because the activities are fun)

    

    - Child Directed (the child’s preferences are used to initiate therapeutic
    experiences within the session).

    



Children with lower sensitivity (hyposensitivity) may be exposed to strong sensations such
as stroking with a brush, vibrations or rubbing. Play may involve a range of materials to
stimulate the senses such as play dough or finger painting.

Children with heightened sensitivity (hypersensitivity) may be exposed to peaceful
activities including quiet music and gentle rocking in a softly lit room. Treats and rewards
may be used to encourage children to tolerate activities they would normally avoid.

While occupational therapists using a sensory integration frame of reference work on
increasing a child’s ability to tolerate and integrate sensory input, other OTs may focus
on environmental accommodations that parents and school staff can use to enhance the
child’s function at home, school, and in the community (Biel and Peske, 2005). These may
include selecting soft, tag-free clothing, avoiding fluorescent lighting, and providing
ear plugs for “emergency” use (such as for fire drills).

There is a growing evidence base that points to and supports the notion that adults also show
signs of sensory processing difficulties. In the United Kingdom early research and improved
clinical outcomes for clients assessed as having sensory processing difficulties is
indicating that the therapy may be an appropriate treatment (Urwin and Ballinger 2005) [18]
for a range of presentations seen in adult clients including for those with Autism and
Asperger’s Syndrome, as well as adults with dyspraxia and some mental health difficulties
(Brown, Shankar and Smith 2009) [19] that therapists suggest may arise from the difficulties
adults with sensory processing difficulties encounter trying to negotiate the challenges
and demands of engaging in everyday life(Brown, Shankar and Smith 2006). [20]

[ edit ] Snoezelen Rooms



Some individuals with sensory processing disorder may benefit from spending time in
Snoezelen environments. Snoezelen rooms may consist of several elements that can both
energize and relax users. These elements include anything from various lighting effects and
areas of darkness, to tactile bins and vibrating surfaces, as well as scents and sounds. The
individual enters the room with opportunity for free exploration. He or she is given time to
seek out the sensory experiences that appeal to his or her unique sensory system. This process
can help regulate the sensory system. [21]

[ edit ] Alternative views



Not all professionals agree with the notion that hypersensitive or hyposensitve senses
necessarily constitute a disorder. However, sensory integration dysfunction, sometimes
called sensory processing disorder, is only diagnosed when the sensory behavior interferes
significantly with learning, playing, and activities of daily living (ADL).

Sensory issues can be located on a spectrum. Being annoyed and distracted by the sound of a
noisy ventilation system or the scratchiness of a sweater is considered to be a typical
sensory response. When a child is so strongly affected by background noise or tactile
sensations that he totally withdraws, becomes hyperactive and impulsive, or lashes out as
part of a primitive fight-or-flight response, the child’s sensory issues are severe
enough to warrant intervention.

In addition to experiencing hypersensitivity, a person can experience hyposensitivity
(undersensitivity to sensory stimuli). One example of this is insensitivity to pain. A child
with sensory integration dysfunction may giggle when given an injection or not even blink
when receiving a second-degree burn.

There is no empirical evidence that hypersensitivity results from sensory integration
issues. There is anecdotal evidence that sensory integration therapy results in more
typical sensory responses and sensory processing. For example, Temple Grandin has reported
that the deep pressure, or proprioceptive input, created by a cattle squeeze machine she used
in her youth resulted in her being able to interact in her environment.

Additionally, over 130 articles on sensory integration have been published in
peer-reviewed (mostly occupational therapy) journals. The difficulties of designing
double-blind research studies of sensory integration dysfunction have been addressed by
Temple Grandin and others. More research is needed.

It is speculated that SID may be a misdiagnosis for persons with attention problems. For
example, a student who fails to repeat what has been said in class (due to boredom or
distraction) might be referred for evaluation for sensory integration dysfunction. The
student might then be evaluated by an occupational therapist to determine why he is having
difficulty focusing and attending, and perhaps also evaluated by an audiologist or a
speech-language pathologist for auditory processing issues or language processing
issues.

As part of the auditory evaluation, the student may be asked to listen to signals coming from
either side of a pair of headphones and identify where they are coming from. If the student is
bored or distracted, or confused by the oral directions given, the test may be inconclusive
and may not isolate what the problem is. The assessor must consider sensory and language
factors in evaluating the student’s performance on the test. Diagnoses based on single
tests are unreliable, and integrated assessment utilizing multiple sources of information
is the preferred means of diagnosis.

Similarly, a child may be mistakenly labeled “ADHD” or “ADD” because impulsivity
has been observed, when actually this impulsivity is limited to sensory seeking or avoiding.
A child might regularly jump out of his seat in class despite multiple warnings and threats
because his poor proprioception (body awareness) causes him to fall out of his seat, and his
anxiety over this potential problem causes him to avoid sitting whenever possible.

If the same child is able to remain seated after being given an inflatable bumpy cushion to sit
on (which gives him more sensory input), or, is able to remain seated at home or in a particular
classroom but not in his main classroom, it is a sign that more evaluation is needed to
determine the cause of his impulsivity.

Children with FAS ( Fetal Alcohol Syndrome ) display many sensory integration problems.

While the diagnosis of sensory integration dysfunction is accepted widely among
occupational therapists and also educators, these professionals have been criticized for
overextending a model that attempts to explain emotional and behavioral problems that could
be caused by other conditions.

Children who receive the diagnosis of sensory integration dysfunction may also have signs of
anxiety problems, ADHD, food intolerances, and behavioral disorders, as well as for autism,
and may have genetic problems such as Fragile X syndrome. Sensory integration dysfunction is
not considered to be on the autism spectrum, and a child can receive a diagnosis of sensory
integration dysfunction without any comorbid conditions.

Because comorbid conditions are common with sensory integration issues, a child may have
other conditions as well which make him or her reactive, “touchy”, or unpredictable, and
manifest in a manner similar to that characterized by occupational therapists as sensory
integration dysfunction.

The theory of SI points out that children learn through their senses. A child who seems to have
difficulty processing sensory information, may not be developmentally on track (in terms of
social skills, fine motor skills, gross motor skills, language, etc.)

SI therapy is not “one size fits all.” According to SI theory, children with sensory
integration issues have their own unique set of sensory responses that need to be addressed.
What is calming and focusing for one child may be overstimulating for another, and vice versa.
Treatment often depends on the child’s unique set of sensory responses.

Some adults identify themselves as having sensory integration dysfunction; that is, they
report that their hypersensitivity, hyposensitivity, and related sensory processing
issues, such as poor self-regulation, continue to cause significant interference in their
daily lives at home, at work, and at school.

Alternatively, there is evidence to suggest that some gifted children also have an increased
tendency toward hypersensitivity (e.g., finding all shirt tags unbearable), which may be
correlated with their greater intellectual proclivity toward perceiving the world in
unconventional ways. [22] [23] [24] [25]

[ edit ] History of study



The position-movement sensation was originally described in 1557 by Julius Caesar Scaliger
as a “sense of locomotion”. [2] Much later, in 1826, Charles Bell expounded the idea of a
“muscle sense” [3] and this is credited with being one of the first described physiologic
feedback mechanisms. [4] Bell’s idea was that commands are carried from the brain to the
muscles, and that reports on the muscle’s condition would be sent in the reverse direction.
Later, in 1880, Henry Charlton Bastian suggested “kinaesthesia” instead of “muscle
sense” on the basis that some of the afferent information (back to the brain) was coming from
other structures including tendons, joints, and skin. [5] In 1889, Alfred Goldscheider
suggested a classification of kinaesthesia into three types: muscle, tendon, and articular
sensitivity. [6]

In 1906, Charles Scott Sherrington published a landmark work that introduced the terms
“proprioception”, “interoception”, and “exteroception”. The
“exteroceptors” are the organs responsible for information from outside the body such
as the eyes, ears, mouth, and skin. The interoceptors then give information about the
internal organs, while “proprioception” is awareness of movement derived from
muscular, tendon, and articular sources. Such a system of classification has kept
physiologists and anatomists searching for specialised nerve endings that transmit data on
joint capsule and muscle tension (such as muscle spindles and Pacini corpuscles).

[ edit ] Proprioception and kinesthesia



Kinesthesia is another term that is often used interchangeably with proprioception, though
use of the term “kinesthesia” can place a greater emphasis on motion. [7] [8] [9]

Some differentiate the kinesthetic sense from proprioception by excluding the sense of
equilibrium or balance from kinesthesia. An inner ear infection, for example, might degrade
the sense of balance. This would degrade the proprioceptive sense, but not the kinesthetic
sense. The affected individual would be able to walk, but only by using the sense of sight to
maintain balance; the person would be unable to walk with eyes closed.

Proprioception and kinesthesia are seen as interrelated and there is considerable
disagreement regarding the definition of these terms. Some of this difficulty stems from
Sherrington’s original description of joint position sense (or the ability to determine
exactly where a particular body part is in space) and kinesthesia (or the sensation that the
body part has moved) under a more general heading of proprioception. Clinical aspects of
proprioception are measured in tests that measure a subject’s ability to detect an
externally imposed passive movement, or the ability to reposition a joint to a predetermined
position. Often it is assumed that the ability of one of these aspects will be related to
another; however, experimental evidence suggests there is no strong relation between these
two aspects. [ citation needed ] This suggests that while these components may well be related
in a cognitive manner, they may in fact be physiologically separate.

Much of the foregoing work is dependent on the notion that proprioception is, in essence, a
feedback mechanism; that is, the body moves (or is moved) and then the information about this
is returned to the brain, whereby subsequent adjustments could be made. More recent work [
citation needed ] into the mechanism of ankle sprains suggests that the role of reflexes may be
more limited due to their long latencies (even at the spinal cord level), as ankle sprain
events occur in perhaps 100 ms or less. In accordance, a model has been proposed to include a
‘feedforward’ component of proprioception, whereby the subject will also have central
information about the body’s position prior to attaining it.

Kinesthesia is a key component in muscle memory and hand-eye coordination , and training can
improve this sense (see blind contour drawing ). The ability to swing a golf club or to catch a
ball requires a finely tuned sense of the position of the joints. This sense needs to become
automatic through training to enable a person to concentrate on other aspects of
performance, such as maintaining motivation or seeing where other people are.

[ edit ] Basis of proprioceptive sense



The initiation of proprioception is the activation of a proprioreceptor in the periphery.
[10] The proprioceptive sense is believed to be composed of information from sensory neurons
located in the inner ear (motion and orientation) and in the stretch receptors located in the
muscles and the joint-supporting ligaments (stance). There are specific nerve receptors
for this form of perception termed “proprioreceptors,” just as there are specific
receptors for pressure, light, temperature, sound, and other sensory experiences.
Proprioreceptors are sometimes known as adequate stimuli receptors. TRPN , a member of the
transient receptor potential family of ion channels , has been found to be responsible for
proprioception in fruit flies , [11] nematode worms , [12] African clawed frogs , [13] and
zebrafish . [14] The human proprioceptor has yet to be discovered.

Although it was known that finger kinesthesia relies on skin sensation, recent research has
found that kinesthesia-based haptic perception relies strongly on the forces experienced
during touch. [15] This research allows the creation of “virtual”, illusory haptic
shapes with different perceived qualities. [16]

David Bohm expands the idea of proprioception to include the “self perception of
thought” in which thought is aware of its movement. [17] [18]

[ edit ] Conscious and unconscious proprioception



    In humans, a distinction is made between conscious proprioception and unconscious
    proprioception:

    - Conscious proprioception is communicated by the posterior column-medial lemniscus
    pathway to the cerebrum . [19]

    

    

    - Unconscious proprioception is communicated primarily via the dorsal
    spinocerebellar tract , [20] to the cerebellum .

    

    

    - An unconscious reaction is seen in the human proprioceptive reflex, or Law of Righting
    â€“ in the event that the body tilts in any direction, the person will cock their head
    back to level the eyes against the horizon. [21] This is seen even in infants as soon as they
    gain control of their neck muscles. This control comes from the cerebellum , the part of
    the brain affecting balance.

    



[ edit ] Applications



[ edit ] Law enforcement



Proprioception is tested by American police officers using the field sobriety test , wherein
the subject is required to touch his or her nose with eyes closed. People with normal
proprioception may make an error of no more than 20 millimeters . People suffering from
impaired proprioception (a symptom of moderate to severe alcohol intoxication ) fail this
test due to difficulty locating their limbs in space relative to their noses.

[ edit ] Diagnosis



There are several relatively specific tests of the subject’s ability to propriorecept.
These tests are used in the diagnosis of neurological disorders . They include the visual and
tactile placing reflexes . [22]

[ edit ] Learning new skills



Proprioception is what allows someone to learn to walk in complete darkness without losing
balance. During the learning of any new skill, sport, or art, it is usually necessary to become
familiar with some proprioceptive tasks specific to that activity. Without the appropriate
integration of proprioceptive input, an artist would not be able to brush paint onto a canvas
without looking at the hand as it moved the brush over the canvas; it would be impossible to
drive an automobile because a motorist would not be able to steer or use the foot pedals while
looking at the road ahead; a person could not touch type or perform ballet; and people would not
even be able to walk without watching where they put their feet.

Oliver Sacks once reported the case of a young woman who lost her proprioception due to a viral
infection of her spinal cord . [23] At first she was not able to move properly at all or even
control her tone of voice (as voice modulation is primarily proprioceptive). Later she
relearned by using her sight (watching her feet) and inner ear only for movement while using
hearing to judge voice modulation. She eventually acquired a stiff and slow movement and
nearly normal speech, which is believed to be the best possible in the absence of this sense.
She could not judge effort involved in picking up objects and would grip them painfully to be
sure she did not drop them.

[ edit ] Training



The proprioceptive sense can be sharpened through study of many disciplines. Examples are
the Feldenkrais method [24] and the Alexander Technique . Juggling trains reaction time,
spatial location, and efficient movement. Standing on a wobble board or balance board is
often used to retrain or increase proprioception abilities, particularly as physical
therapy for ankle or knee injuries. Slacklining is another method to increase
proprioception. Standing on one leg (stork standing) and various other body-position
challenges are also used in such disciplines as Yoga , Wing Chun and T’ai chi . [ citation
needed ] Several studies have shown that the efficacy of these types of training is challenged
by closing the eyes, [ citation needed ] because the eyes give invaluable feedback to
establishing the moment-to-moment information of balance. There are even specific devices
designed for proprioception training, such as the exercise ball , which works on balancing
the abdominal and back muscles.

[ edit ] Impairment



It has been seen that temporary loss or impairment of proprioception may happen periodically
during growth, mostly during adolescence. Growth that might also influence this would be
large increases or drops in bodyweight/size due to fluctuations of fat ( liposuction , rapid
fat loss or gain) and/or muscle content ( bodybuilding , anabolic steroids , catabolisis /
starvation ). It can also occur in those that gain new levels of flexibility , stretching , and
contortion . A limb’s being in a new range of motion never experienced (or at least, not for a
long time since youth perhaps) can disrupt one’s sense of location of that limb. Possible
experiences include suddenly feeling that feet or legs are missing from one’s mental
self-image; needing to look down at one’s limbs to be sure they are still there; and falling
down while walking, especially when attention is focused upon something other than the act of
walking.

Proprioception is occasionally impaired spontaneously, especially when one is tired.
One’s body may appear too large or too small, or parts of the body may appear distorted in
size. Similar effects can sometimes occur during epilepsy or migraine auras . These effects
are presumed to arise from abnormal stimulation of the part of the parietal cortex of the brain
involved with integrating information from different parts of the body. [25]

Proprioceptive illusions can also be induced, such as the Pinocchio illusion .

The proprioceptive sense is often unnoticed because humans will adapt to a continuously
present stimulus; this is called habituation , desensitization , or adaptation . The effect
is that proprioceptive sensory impressions disappear, just as a scent can disappear over
time. One practical advantage of this is that unnoticed actions or sensation continue in the
background while an individual’s attention can move to another concern. The Alexander
Technique addresses these issues.

People that have a limb amputated may still have a confused sense of that limb’s existence on
their body, known as phantom limb syndrome . Phantom sensations can occur as passive
proprioceptive sensations of the limb’s presence, or more active sensations such as
perceived movement, pressure, pain, itching, or temperature. There are a variety of
theories concerning the etiology of phantom limb sensations and experience. Jack Tsao, MD.
at Walter Reed Hospital has advanced a theory based on the concept of “proprioceptive
memory.” This theory argues that the brain retains a memory of specific limb positions and
that after amputation there is a conflict between the visual system, which literally sees
that the limb is missing, and the memory system which remembers the limb as a functioning part
of the body. [26] Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body
parts other than the limbs, such as after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth
(phantom tooth pain), or removal of an eye ( phantom eye syndrome ).

Temporary impairment of proprioception has also been known to occur from an overdose of
vitamin B6 (pyridoxine and pyridoxamine). Most of the impaired function returns to normal
shortly after the intake of vitamins returns to normal. Impairment can also be caused by
cytotoxic factors such as chemotherapy .

It has been proposed that even common tinnitus and the attendant hearing frequency-gaps
masked by the perceived sounds may cause erroneous proprioceptive information to the
balance and comprehension centers of the brain, precipitating mild confusion.

Proprioception is permanently impaired in patients that suffer from joint hypermobility or
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (a genetic condition that results in weak connective tissue
throughout the body). It can also be permanently impaired from viral infections as reported
by Sacks. The catastrophic effect of major proprioceptive loss is reviewed by
Robles-De-La-Torre (2006). [27]

Vestibular System

Posted by: adifferentworld | March 25, 2012 Comments Off | From Wikipedia, the free

Figure 1: The labyrinth of the inner ear , from the left ear. It contains i) the cochlea
(yellow), which is the peripheral organ of our auditory system; ii) the semicircular canals
(brown), which transduce rotational movements; and iii) the otolithic organs (in the
blue/purple pouches), which transduce linear accelerations. The light blue pouch is the
endolymphatic sac, and contains only fluid.

The vestibular system , which contributes to balance in most mammals and to the sense of
spatial orientation , is the sensory system that provides the leading contribution about
movement and sense of balance . Together with the cochlea , a part of the auditory system , it
constitutes the labyrinth of the inner ear in most mammals, situated in the vestibulum in the
inner ear (Figure 1). As our movements consist of rotations and translations, the vestibular
system comprises two components: the semicircular canal system, which indicate rotational
movements; and the otoliths , which indicate linear accelerations. The vestibular system
sends signals primarily to the neural structures that control our eye movements, and to the
muscles that keep us upright . The projections to the former provide the anatomical basis of
the vestibulo-ocular reflex , which is required for clear vision; and the projections to the
muscles that control our posture are necessary to keep us upright.

[ edit ] Semicircular canal system



The semicircular canal system detects rotational movements. The semicircular canals are
its main tools to achieve this detection.

[ edit ] Structure

Main article: Semicircular canal

    As the basis of our perception of a three-dimensional world, our vestibular system
    contains three semicircular canals in each labyrinth . They are approximately
    orthogonal (right angles) to each other, and are called the horizontal (or lateral ), the
    anterior semicircular canal (or superior ) and the posterior (or inferior )
    semicircular canal. Anterior and posterior canals may be collectively called vertical
    semicircular canals .

    - Movement of fluid within the horizontal semicircular canal corresponds to rotation of
    the head around a vertical axis (i.e. the neck), as when doing a pirouette .

    

    - The anterior and posterior semicircular canals detect rotations of the head in the
    sagittal plane (as when nodding), and in the frontal plane , as when cartwheeling . Both
    anterior and posterior canals are orientated at approximately 45Â° between frontal
    and sagittal planes.

    



The movement of fluid pushes on a structure called cupula , which contains hair cells that
transduce the mechanical movement to electrical signals [1]

Figure 2: Push-pull system of the semicircular canals, for a horizontal head movement to the
right.

The canals are arranged in such a way that each canal on the left side has an almost parallel
counterpart on the right side. Each of these three pairs works in a push-pull fashion: when one
canal is stimulated, its corresponding partner on the other side is inhibited, and vice
versa.

This push-pull system allows us to sense all directions of rotation: while the right
horizontal canal gets stimulated during head rotations to the right (Fig 2), the left
horizontal canal gets stimulated (and thus predominantly signals) by head rotations to the
left.

Vertical canals are coupled in a crossed fashion, i.e. stimulations that are excitatory for
an anterior canal are also inhibitory for the contralateral posterior, and vice versa.

[ edit ] Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

The vestibulo-ocular reflex. A rotation of the head is detected, which triggers an
inhibitory signal to the extraocular muscles on one side and an excitatory signal to the
muscles on the other side. The result is a compensatory movement of the eyes. Main article:
Vestibulo-ocular reflex

The vestibulo-ocular reflex ( VOR ) is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the
retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head
movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field. For example, when the
head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left, and vice versa. Since slight head movements
are present all the time, the VOR is very important for stabilizing vision: patients whose VOR
is impaired find it difficult to read, because they cannot stabilize the eyes during small
head tremors. The VOR reflex does not depend on visual input and works even in total darkness or
when the eyes are closed.

This reflex, combined with the push-pull principle described above, forms the
physiological basis of the Rapid head impulse test or Halmagyi-Curthoys-test , in which the
head is rapidly and forcefully moved to the side, while observing whether the eyes keep
looking in the same direction.

[ edit ] Mechanics



The mechanics of the semicircular canals can be described by a damped oscillator. If we
designate the deflection of the cupula with

, and the head velocity with

    http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/f/9/4/f94a8a6db350d3aa04893eb54835acc9.png
    , the cupula deflection is approximately

Î± is a proportionality factor, and s corresponds to the frequency. For humans, the time
constants T 1 and T 2 are approximately 3 ms and 5 s, respectively. As a result, for typical head
movements, which cover the frequency range of 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz, the deflection of the cupula is
approximately proportional to the head-velocity. This is very useful, since the velocity of
the eyes must be opposite to the velocity of the head in order to have clear vision.

[ edit ] Central processing



Signals from the vestibular system also project to the cerebellum (where they are used to keep
the VOR effective, a task usually referred to as learning or adaptation ) and to different
areas in the cortex. The projections to the cortex are spread out over different areas, and
their implications are currently not clearly understood.

[ edit ] Projection Pathways



    The vestibular nuclei on either sides of the brain stem exchange signals regarding
    movement and body position. These signals are sent down the following projection
    pathways.

    - To the Cerebellum. Signals sent to the cerebellum are relayed back as muscle movements
    of the head, eyes, and posture.

    

    - To Nuclei of Nerves III, IV, and VI. Signals sent to these nerves cause the
    vestibule-ocular reflex. They allow for the eyes to fix on a moving object while staying
    in focus.

    

    - To the Reticular Formation. Signals sent to the reticular formation signal the new
    posture the body has taken on and how to adjust circulation and breathing due to body
    position.

    

    - To the Spinal Cord. Signals sent to the spinal cord allow quick reflex reactions to both
    the limbs and trunk to regain balance.

    

    - To the Thalamus. Signals sent to the thalamus allow for head and body motor control as
    well as being conscious of body position.

[ edit ] Otolithic organ



While the semicircular canals respond to rotations, the otolithic organs sense linear
accelerations. We have two on each side, one called utricle , the other saccule . The otoconia
crystals in the otoconia layer rest on a viscous gel layer, and are heavier than their
surroundings. Therefore they get displaced during linear acceleration, which in turn
deflects the ciliary bundles of the hair cells and thus produces a sensory signal. Most of the
utricular signals elicit eye movements, while the majority of the saccular signals projects
to muscles that control our posture. While the interpretation of the rotation signals from
the semicircular canals is straightforward, the interpretation of otolith signals is more
difficult: since gravity is equivalent to a constant linear acceleration, we somehow have to
distinguish otolith signals that are caused by linear movements from such that are caused by
gravity. We can do that quite well, but the neural mechanisms underlying this separation are
not yet fully understood. We can sense head tilting and linear acceleration even in dark
environments because of the orientation of two groups of hair cell bundles on either side of
the striola. Hair cells on opposite sides move with mirror symmetry, so when one side is moved,
the other is inhibited. The opposing effects caused by a tilt of the head, causing
differential sensory inputs from the hair cell bundles allow us to tell which way the head is
tilting [3] . Sensory information is then sent to the brain, which can respond with
appropriate corrective actions to the nervous and muscular systems to ensure that balance
and awareness are maintained [4] .

[ edit ] Experience from the vestibular system



Experience from the vestibular system is called equilibrioception . It is mainly used for the
sense of balance and for spatial orientation . When the vestibular system is stimulated
without any other inputs, one experiences a sense of self motion. For example, a person in
complete darkness and sitting in a chair will feel that he or she has turned to the left if the
chair is turned to the left. A person in an elevator , with essentially constant visual input,
will feel she is descending as the elevator starts to descend.

[ edit ] Pathologies



Diseases of the vestibular system can take different forms, and usually induce vertigo and
instability, often accompanied by nausea. The most common ones are Vestibular neuritis , a
related condition called Labyrinthitis , and BPPV . In addition, the function of the
vestibular system can be affected by tumors on the cochleo-vestibular nerve, an infarct in
the brain stem or in cortical regions related to the processing of vestibular signals, and
cerebellar atrophy.

    Alcohol can also cause alterations in the vestibular system for short periods of time and
    will result in vertigo and possibly nystagmus. This is due to the variable viscosity of
    the blood and the endolymph during the consumption of alcohol. The common term for this
    type of sensation is the “Bed Spins”.

    - PAN I – The alcohol concentration is higher in the blood than in the vestibular system,
    hence the endolymph is relatively dense.

    

    - PAN II – The alcohol concentration is lower in the blood than in the vestibular system,
    hence the endolymph is relatively dilute.

    



It is interesting to note that PAN I will result in subjective vertigo in one direction and
typically occurs shortly after ingestion of alcohol when blood alcohol levels are highest.
PAN II will eventually cause subjective vertigo in the opposite direction. This occurs
several hours after ingestion and after a relative reduction in blood alcohol levels.

[ edit ] BPPV

Main article: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo

BPPV, which is short for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo , is probably caused by pieces
that have broken off from the Otoliths, and have slipped into one of the semicircular canals.
In most cases it is the posterior canal that is affected. In certain head positions, these
particles shift and create a fluid wave which displaces the cupula of the canal affected,
which leads to dizziness, vertigo and nystagmus .
