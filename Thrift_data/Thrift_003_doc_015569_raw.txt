Ethics of Electronic Discovery – Part Two

March 8, 2012



For Part One, see here.

Ethical Analysis of the Hypothetical



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ethics-duality-imbalance.jpg?w=240&h=102
What ethical considerations and rules or professional conduct come into play in this
scenario? Let us analyze the facts of the hypothetical one rule at a time and consider the
impact of all six of the key rules: Rule 1.1 â€“ Competence; Rule 1.3 â€“ Diligence;
Rule 1.6 â€“ Confidentiality; Rule 3.2 â€“ Expediting Litigation; Rule 3.3
â€“ Candor Toward the Tribunal; and, Rule 3.4 â€“ Fairness to Opposing Party and
Counsel.

Competence. The competency issue here is critical, as it is in most ethical considerations.
One party here, the plaintiffsâ€™ counsel, does not really understood e-discovery.
For instance, they did not really understand many of the technical reasons behind
defendantâ€™s position, such as deduplication and email copies throughout the
system, nor the sampling disclosures. They did not understand the benefits of phased
discovery and going first for the low hanging fruit, the emails of the best key custodians.



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cavemen2.jpg?w=194&h=240
They did not cooperate in e-discovery because they did not know how. They probably had never
even seen the cooperative model in action before, and so when they saw it here, they did not
recognize it. They may instead have mistaken it for weak or timid opposing counsel. It just
provoked them to be more caveman like. They got more aggressive in the face of the unknown. They
also ran away from any real discussion on technical issues. A classic case of the fight or
flight instincts of a pre-computer-literate-lawyer faced with e-discovery.

Plaintiffsâ€™ counsel in this hypothetical did not trust the other side because they
assumed they were like them. They were not competent enough to recognize or understand the new
approach. They only understood â€œcooperationâ€� from the outside, as just
another tool, or keyword, in the game of hide-the-ball. They certainly had not read Professor
Genslerâ€™s article and had no understanding at all on how the new cooperative,
trans-negotiation model might help their clients. In Professor Genzlerâ€™s words:

The Cooperation Proclamation is exactly right when it urges lawyers to see cooperation as a
means for advancing their clientsâ€™ interests and not as a retreat from their duties as
loyal advocates. As I have written elsewhere, the lawyers who default to battle mode in
discovery â€“ who fail even to consider whether cooperation might yield better results
â€“ are the ones who truly fail to serve their clientsâ€™ interests.

The Bullâ€™s-Eye View of Cooperation in Discovery , 10 Sedona Conf. J. 363, at 363 (2009
Supp.)

They had also not read the article by the Sedona Conference making the legal case for
cooperation, The Case for Cooperation , supra. The editor-in-chief of this article was
well-known plaintiffâ€™s counsel, William P. Butterfield. The concluding paragraph
of The Case for Cooperation succulently warns of what may happen to our system of justice if the
new cooperative model to discovery is not adopted:

If parties are expected to continue to manage discovery in the manner envisioned by the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, cooperation will be necessary. Without such cooperation,
discovery will become too expensive and time consuming for parties to effectively litigate
their disputes.

The Case for Cooperation , Id. at 362.

Plaintiffsâ€™ counsel here did not even seem to understand what most truly competent
plaintiffâ€™s counsel do, that every dollar spent on useless discovery is another
dollar not available for settlement. The best, most competent counsel have always saved
their powder for the real battles that count, on the law and application of the law to the facts.
They have always understood that the true, and only valid purpose of discovery is to get at the
key facts to allow reasoned evaluation of the case, not to prepare mountains of data, or extort
the responding party, or bury the requesting party in a document dump. Competent legal
counsel do not engage in discovery as abuse .Â  Those that do soon develop a reputation that
follows them into a court room, even if it is on the other side of the country of where they
usually practice. See Discovery As Abuse , 69 B.U. L. REV. 635 (1989). As the Sedona Conference
noted, the â€œrisk of gaining a reputation among the judiciary as unduly combative
during discovery, encourages cooperative behavior.â€� The Case for Cooperation,
supra at pg. 362.

The only possible conclusion here is that Plaintiffsâ€™ were not competent to handle
the e-discovery issues in this class-action employment case. For that reason alone, under
this scenario they behaved unethically. They violated Rule 1.1.

Many attorneys in this situation attempt to meet their ethical obligation of competence by
hiring an e-discovery vendor to advise them. Unfortunately, this usually does not work, for
such experts frequently only tell the attorneys who hired them what they want to hear. The
hired guns simply supply arguments jazzed up with tech-speak to support the legal argument of
the attorneys who hired them.

In any event, e-discovery vendors are technologists, not lawyers, and even when a rare
e-discovery expert at a vendor does also have a law degree, they do not provide legal advice.
They are not allowed to provide legal advice. The only way an attorney who is not competent in
the law and practice of e-discovery can fulfill their ethical duty is by taking the time and
considerable efforts needed to become competent, or by bringing in legal counsel who is
competent to assist him or her. Vendors cannot do that. They cannot render legal advice, but I
appear to be the only one pointing out that obvious fact. See EDRM Model Code of Conduct . In
fact, the EDRM proposed vendor ethical code of conduct, Principle 4 – Sound Process , seems
like it encourages vendors to provide legal advice: “Service Providers should define,
implement and audit documented sound processes that are designed to preserve legal
defensibility.” This is a gray I know, but I strongly encourage the experts who are involved
in this EDRM project to carefully consider the whole UPL issue and clarify draft Principle 4
and its comments on legal defensibility . By the way, except for my issue with Principle 4 and
UPL, I am favorably impressed with the proposed model e-discovery vendor ethics guidelines
that EDRM has come up with and encourage all vendors to study it carefully.

Diligence. Plaintiffâ€™s counsel here thought they were being diligent because they
were engaging in what they saw as vigorous advocacy. Too bad they were playing the wrong game.
True vigorous advocacy here would have entailed detailed examination of the reasons
provided by defense counsel for the five custodians and seven issues. It would have required
reciprocal disclosures on their part on their thinking and analysis of the importance of the
various custodians to the case. Diligence would have required immediate study of the emails
produced. It would have taken the dispute out of rhetoric and knee-jerk opposition to
everything the other side proposes, and into the facts and legal analysis.

Plaintiffsâ€™ counsel in this scenario was not diligent at all. Their incompetence
made that impossible. They thought they were being very diligent, and no doubt so did their
clients, who are usually very easily impressed by the kind of saber-rattling in which they
engaged. But in fact they did all of the wrong things.Â  They engaged in knee-jerk
opposition to everything the other side proposed, and this pretend diligence was really not
diligent at all. Discovery as abuse is not an exercise in competent diligence. It is abuse,
pure and simple.



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/secretshh.jpg?w=162&h=216
Confidentiality. Plaintiffsâ€™ counsel here thought they were being very ethical by
refusing to disclose their work product. They would not give the defendant an idea on their
thinking of the case, on what information they thought would be highly relevant. They would
not disclose why they thought some custodians and issues were more important. That was their
confidential thinking, and they thought they should keep it secret. They hoped to keep their
analysis of the case (assume they had one, and this was not just a superficial form-driven
lawsuit) to themselves. They wanted to surprise defendants as much as possible. Indeed, they
were initially surprised by how much confidential information the defense counsel here
provided, which, again, they mistakenly mistook as a sign of weakness and egged them on to keep
demanding more and more. Then they were surprised again when defense counsel said no, and
never budged from the initial 5/7. And finally were surprised again by the court ruling
against them and went with the defense plan.

So which attorneys in this scenario met their ethical duty under Rule 1.6 to â€œnot reveal
information relating to the representation of a clientâ€� and which did not? Rule 1.6
has numerous exceptions to the duty of client confidentiality, including where the client
gives informed consent or the â€œdisclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry
out the representation.â€�

Here the disclosure by defense counsel was needed to carry out the representation and so
impliedly authorized, even if not specifically authorized. Note that under the scenario no
attorney-client privileged documents are disclosed, nor any privileged communications.
Even client confidential documents are protected under a strong confidentiality order. Any
non-relevant documents produced would also be covered by the confidentiality order and
would be promptly returned. Further protection was provided by a strong clawback order.

The only confidential information disclosed here is some of the work-product privileged
thinking and analysis of defense counsel. Unlike the attorney-client privilege, which is
held by the client and can only be released by the client, the work-product privilege is held by
the attorney, and released by the attorney. The disclosure of the attorneyâ€™s work
product was made here to advance their clientâ€™s interests. It was made to facilitate
efficient, cost-effective search and production, and later to obtain a protective order
preventing unduly burdensome, disproportionate e-discovery. This kind of disclosure does
not violate defense counselâ€™s duties under Rule 1.6.

My conclusion is based on an understanding of how work product privilege waiver is different
from attorney-client privileged waiver. It does not automatically open up the door for
further inquiries as attorney-client waiver might do. My thanks to Professor Mark S. Sidoti ,
who is part of Professor Hamilton’s excellent email discussion group for e-discovery
professors, full-time and adjunct. Professor Sidoti, whose day job is at Gibbons , pointed
out a key case in this area, Williams & Connolly LLP v. U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78570 (D.D.C. Aug. 4, 2010) :

The work product doctrine protects both deliberative materials such as mental impressions,
conclusions, opinions, and legal theories and factual materials prepared in anticipation
of litigation. *** In his declaration in support of summary judgment, David Frohlich, an
Assistant Director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, explains that the handwritten
notes sought by Plaintiff were generated during the Cendant investigation in anticipation
of litigation with Mr. Corigliano, Mr. Kearney, and others. Plaintiff does not dispute this
statement and concedes that these documents qualify as attorney work product. However,
Plaintiff contends that the SEC has waived any work product privilege with respect to these
documents because similar handwritten notes were disclosed to Plaintiff during the
criminal prosecution of Mr. Forbes. According to the declaration of Christopher R. Hart, an
attorney at Williams & Connolly LLP, at least eleven of the documents of handwritten notes
identified in the Vaughn index were produced by the government during the Forbes matter.
Plaintiff thus contends that the government has “waived the work product privilege as to
entire subject matter of handwritten notes between SEC staff and Corigliano, Kearney, or
their respective counsel.”

As with the attorney-client privilege, a party may waive the work product privilege through
disclosure. See In re United Mine Workers of Am. Employee Benefit Plans Litig ., 159 F.R.D.
307, 310 (D.D.C. 1994) (“It seems . . . clear in this Circuit that the disclosure of documents
protected by the attorney work product privilege waives the protections of the attorney work
product privilege as to the documents disclosed.”). However, “the test for waiving
attorney work product protection is more stringent than the test for waiving
attorney-client privilege.” Goodrich Corp. v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency , 593 F. Supp. 2d
184, 191 (D.D.C. 2009). Although disclosure of documents waives attorney-client privilege
with respect to all other communications related to the same subject matter, the scope of
“subject matter waiver” with respect to work product materials is more limited. “[A]
subject-matter waiver of the attorney work product privilege should only be found when it
would be inconsistent with the purposes of the work product privilege to limit the waiver to
the actual documents disclosed.” “Several factors figure into the analysis: whether
disclosure was intentional or inadvertent, the breadth of the waiver sought, and the extent
to which the requested documents would reveal litigation strategies or trial
preparations.” (emphasis added)

The law provides greater protection to work-product waiver and so the disclosures made in the
hypothetical should leave defense counsel protected from any further unwanted intrusions.
Also see Rule 502 Federal Rules of Evidence , and note that our hypothetical assumes a strong
confidentiality and clawback order under Rule 502(d).

As for the conduct of plaintiff’s counsel, it may surprise you to know that I do not conclude
they have violated Rule 1.6. I must conclude that plaintiffs stonewalling actions in this
case are also consistent with Rule 1.6. Although their behavior in this hypothetical was
unethical under the other rules here considered, it was not under Rule 1.6. They have the right
to keep all of their work product to themselves, even though it was stupid to do so, and thus a
probable violation of Rule 1.1 on competence, but it is was their work-product. Of course, no
rule should be considered in isolation, and work-product thinking is required to be
disclosed under many rules of civil procedures, including especially Rule 26(f), and any
time you are seeking relief from the court, or making final preparation for trial, not to
mention trial itself.

In the same professorial discussion group my esteemed LegalTech debating adversary,
Professor Craig Ball, had this to say concerning the policy behind limited work product
disclosures, starting with a comment on pre-digital paper productions:

You may argue that we never got to look behind a lawyer’s decisions to produce or withhold
even if the lawyer made the selections by throwing documents down the stairs and producing
only what hit the next landing. But perhaps that’s not an approach we want to replicate in
post-digital practice. We indulged ourselves in the belief that, right or wrong, relevance
and privilege determinations were a lawyer’s to make and largely immune from being
second-guessed absent evidence of gross dereliction or misconduct. But, as we move into the
realm of search technology–and especially those like keyword search only lately
appreciated to be deeply flawed–the tools and methods employed must be closely examined
and tested, including by exposing them to adversarial challenge.

Perhaps we need to step away from our reflexive “we are lawyers and we are special,” in
order to consider what approaches are calculated to best serve the ends of justice.
Cooperation demands communication. If you believe the first is more than a pipe dream, you
need to embrace the latter.

I have to agree with Craig on this one. Opposing counsel need to talk with each other and explain
what they are doing in the area of search and production. You do not have to give up all your trade
secrets, nor reveal all of your strategies, but you have to be prepared to disclose enough to
show your reasonable, good faith efforts. What does cooperation look like? It looks like
lawyers talking and making mutual disclosures needed to plan discovery in a case.

Expediting Litigation. The conduct of plaintiffsâ€™ counsel here violated their duty
to expedite litigation. They did so in spite of the fact that expedited litigation is almost
always consistent with a plaintiffâ€™s interest in a civil proceeding for a speedy
trial. Plaintiffsâ€™ counsel here unethically violated this duty to expedite by
forcing unnecessary motion practice. Further, the closed approach of plaintiffsâ€™
counsel to try to conceal the facts they really wanted in discovery probably also violated
Rule 3.2, even of it did not violate Rule 1.6. See eg. DeGeer v. Gillis , 755 F. Supp. 2d 909, 930
(N.D. Ill. 2010) (if parties had participated in “candid, meaningful discussion of ESI at
the outset of the case,” expensive and time consuming discovery and motions practice could
have been avoided).

http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fingers_crossed.jpg?w=210&h=199
Candor Toward the Tribunal. I think the conduct of plaintiffsâ€™ counsel in this
hypothetical violated this fundamental Rule of Professional Conduct too, but admit their
violation might be seen as technical, and is certainly the kind of conduct that goes on every
day and is tolerated by both Bench and Bar. Plaintiffsâ€™ counsel here did not â€œ
make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal â€Š or, offer evidence that the lawyer
knows to be false .â€� But they did not provide the whole truth either. They made a demand
in their motion to compel for 30 custodians and 30 issues, and they continued in this demand at
the hearing before the tribunal. Let us assume that they also made oral representations to the
judge at a hearing that they thought this 30/30 demand was necessary and appropriate under the
facts of the case and governing law. But that is at best a half-truth because they have been
willing all along to accept 20/20.

For that reason they did not display the kind of candor to the tribunal that I personally think
is appropriate. Instead, they continued to play the only game they knew how, the negotiation
game , and they treated the judge as just another player in the game. In a negotiation game, you
are never completely candid. That would defeat the whole point of the game. If
plaintiffâ€™s counsel here were in fact candid to the tribunal, they would admit that
20/20 is their goal, but then again, that could be a slippery slope for them. It could also lead
to admission of their basic incompetence to do e-discovery to begin with, to engage in
meaningful discussion and analysis, much less to enter into a true cooperative dialogue with
the other side.

Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel. Some attorneys are surprised when they see the terms
of this important Rule of Professional Conduct.Â  Candor to the tribunal is one thing, but
fairness to the opposing party and their attorneys? That is simply not part of the culture of
many lawyers and law firms! They seem surprised when they are reminded that the requirement is
built into our rules of ethics. It is not a mere professional courtesy, as some think, it is an
ethical imperative. Under Rule 3.4 a lawyer shall not â€œ unlawfully obstruct another
partyâ€™s access to evidence .â€� A lawyer shall not â€œ conceal a document or
other material that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is relevant to a pending or a
reasonably foreseeable proceeding; nor counsel or assist another person to do any such act
.â€� A lawyer shall not in â€œ make a frivolous discovery request or fail to make
reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing
party .â€�

The attorneys for the party responding to the discovery request in this hypothetical,
defense counsel, complied with their ethical duties. My conclusion assumes that they sought
to limit discovery for the grounds stated, burdensomeness and likely relevance. I assume
they did not have any bad faith ulterior motives, such as an attempt to conceal evidence that
they knew to be unfavorable to their client. I assume they were not just trying to obstruct
access to evidence or conceal relevant ESI. Finally, I assume that their search and
production efforts were reasonably diligent.

With these assumptions I conclude defense counsel acted ethically because their refusal to
review and produce any more that five custodians and seven issues in the first round of phased
discovery did not prevent disclosure of any evidence they knew to be relevant, and did not
prevent plaintiffsâ€™ later discovery from other custodians or issues that might
prove necessary. It might delay it to a second phase, but not prevent it. If defense counsel
should uncover a document outside of this scope, one that is obviously relevant, then under
this rule they would be required to disclose such a document and should not conceal it.

I conclude to the contrary that under the given facts plaintiffsâ€™ counsel violated
the duty of fairness to opposing counsel because their initial request for discovery was
frivolous. They signed and served a discovery request for 50 custodians and 50 issues,
knowing that was excessive, and for that reason quickly dropping to 30/30, and ready to accept
20/20, which is what they really thought was reasonable all along. They used a request for
production as a mere negotiation tool, and in so doing made an unethically frivolous
discovery request. Note they also violated Rule 26(g) FRCP, which Judge Grimm in Mancia said
was the most misunderstood and under utilized of all rules of procedure. Rule 26(g) is similar
to Rule 11, but applies only to the discovery pleadings.Â  Rule 26(g)(1)(B) states that a
signature on a discovery request constitutes an attorneyâ€™s certification that the
request is:

(ii) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or
needlessly increase the cost of litigation; andâ€Š

(iii) neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the
case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues
at stake in the action.

They thought 20 custodians and 20 issues was proportional, yet they signed a request for
production seeking 50. They did so for purposes of setting up a negotiation. This is, I
suggest, an improper purpose under 26(g)(1)(B)(ii). They knew 50 was unreasonable and
unduly burdensome, yet they still signed the discovery request. Plaintiffs counsel in this
hypothetical thereby intentionally violated 26(g)(1)(B)(iii) triggering a mandatory
obligation under the rule for the court to impose sanctions.

This conduct by the requesting party was not only a civil rule violation, it was unethical. It
violated Professional Rule of Conduct 34(c) by â€œknowingly disobeying an obligation
under the rules of a tribunal,â€� namely Rule 26(g)(1)(B) and as explained before,
violated ethics Rule Â 34(d) because it was frivolous.

Conclusion

http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/hieronymous_bosch_hell.jpg?w=300&h=225
Some may say my hypothetical is far-fetched, that attorneys do not engage in this type of
behavior. I say, get real . It is an everyday occurrence. The only thing far-fetched about it is
the simplicity of the facts, which I necessary injected into the hypothetical, and, the
relatively mild nature of the violations. In my position as national e-discovery counsel for
a 700 attorney law firm with 48 offices around the country, I see equivalent or worse behavior
by opposing counsel almost every week. It is not exactly a crazy hell-zone as I used to suspect,
and many still believe. Krueger v. Pelican Products Corp ., C/A No. 87-2385-A (W.D. Okla.
1989) (J. Alley) (â€œIf there is a hell to which disputatious, uncivil, vituperative
lawyers go, let it be one in which the damned are eternally locked in discovery disputes with
other lawyers of equally repugnant attributes.â€�) But it is bad, and we need to work
together as a profession to break out of this prison.

Even though this hypothetical is an all-too-common scenario, as far as I know, no attorney has
ever been reprimanded for an ethical violation of Rule 34 upon these circumstances. This
ethics rule, like the 26(g) procedure rule, is a paper tiger. Indeed, you could say that about
all of the ethics rules here discussed in the context of e-discovery. It is a new area of the law
and State Bar Associations are naturally reluctant to enforce its rules in this virgin
territory.

But just because attorneys are no yet being reprimanded or losing their licenses for these
kinds of rule violations, does not mean we should not care about compliance. Following these
well-established rules is the best way to stay on the straight and narrow when it comes to
e-discovery. We cannot let old hide-the-ball practices morph into hide-the-byte operating
systems.

Compliance with the rules of professional conduct, and the new doctrine of Cooperation that
implements these rules (and the rules of civil procedure as Judge Grimm and Professor Genzler
have pointed out), is the best way to avoid the threat warned of by Sedona and many others. It is
the best way to avoid a future world of litigation where standard hide-the-byte operating
systems make â€œ discovery too expensive and time consuming for parties to effectively
litigate their disputes .â€� The Case for Cooperation , Supra at 362.

Although a good argument can be made for the enactment of more new rules of civil procedure to
adapt to the challenges of e-discovery, new rules of professional conduct are not needed. The
ones we have are sufficient to guide us, but we need to take the time and effort to study and
understand these rules. We need to discuss these rules and how they apply to the new situations
presented in e-discovery practice. It is my hope that this early effort in that direction will
stimulate more discussion and analysis of the subject.

Ethics of Electronic Discovery – Part One

March 4, 2012





Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/sharkattorney1.gif?w=146&h=208 I
have been interested in the ethical issues surrounding electronic discovery since 2006. At
that time I phased out my general trial practice, went full-time e-discovery, joined The
Sedona ConferenceÂ®, and started this e-Discovery Team Â® blog. As part of my practice I
read most of the opinions around the country written on e-discovery. I quickly noticed
something I had not seen before in any other field of law. The case law is dominated by sanctions
cases involving spoliation of evidence. Not only that, attorneys are often directly
implicated in this spoliation and accused of many other types of intentional or negligent
misconduct. I began to wonder if I had stepped into a crazy zone of the law where all attorneys
acted like sharks.

This suspicion me to think, write, and speak often on the subject of e-discovery ethics, which
culminated in my article, Lawyers Behaving Badly : Understanding Unprofessional Conduct in
e-Discovery, 60 Mercer L. Rev. 983 (Spring 2009). The article led to my participation in a full
day academic seminar on the subject at Mercer Law School with noted e-discovery experts,
Judge John Facciola, Judge David Baker, Jason R. Baron, William Hamilton, and Professor
Monroe Freedman, and Chilton Varner, the transcript for which is published at 60 Mercer L.
Rev. 863 (Spring 2009). I came to understand that I had not wandered into a special zone of hell,
and that lawyers doing e-discovery were no worse, or no better, than other lawyers. But they
were put to special challenges and conditions unique to this new field of law, and the end
result was many more errors in judgment than you can find anywhere else. These errors continue
as shown by surveys of case law. See eg. Willoughby, Jones, Antine, Sanctions for E-Discovery
Violations: By the Numbers , 60 Duke L.J. 789 (2010).

Lawyers Behaving Badly



In my 2009 law review article, Lawyers Behaving Badly, I concluded that:

[T]he profession has not suddenly become more sinister than before. Although, some suggest
that the dominance of large firms as mega-business enterprises is causing a significant
decline in overall ethics. See Marc Galanter & William Henderson, The Elastic Tournament: A
Second Transformation of the Big Law Firm , 60 STAN. L. REV. 1867 (2008). There may be some truth
to this, but a general decline in ethical standards does not explain why e-discovery
jurisprudence is so rife with malfeasance.

Id. at pg. 985. Instead, I hypothesized four reasons to explain the apparent frequent bad
behavior of so many attorneys in the field of electronic discovery:

There are four fundamental forces at work in e-discovery, which when considered together,
explain most attorney misconduct:

(1) a general lack of technological sophistication,

(2) over-zealous attorney conduct,

(3) a lack of development of professional duties as an advocate, and

(4) legal incompetence.

These ”Wicked Quadrants” are depicted in the circular diagram below.

I am not going to explore the ins and outs of the Wicked Quadrant in this essay, nor rehash the
reasons so many lawyers fall astray in e-discovery. (Interested readers are directed to the
article and symposium transcript)Â  Instead, I am going to review and briefly analyze the
primary Rules of Professional Conduct that are implicated in e-discovery ethics. These are
the rules that we should understand and rely upon to keep us on the straight and narrow , and out
of the sanctions penalty box. At the end of Part One I will present a common hypothetical where
the ethics of many lawyers involved in e-discovery productions are severely tested . In Part
Two I will analyze the hypothetical and show how these rules of Professional Conduct should
apply.

ABA’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct

The ethical codes require all lawyers to be competent, and, if faced with a legal task wherein
they are not competent, such as e-discovery, to bring in other attorneys who are. Rule 1.1 :

A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation
requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary
for the representation.

Our ethics also requires diligence, a task that is impossible unless you are competent and
actually know what to do and when to do it. Rule 1.3 :

A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.

Fast and efficient action is built into our code. It is emphasized again by Rule 3.2 that
requires lawyers to expedite litigation:

A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests
of the client.

The duty of confidentiality is also a core value that often comes into play in e-discovery
practice. It is embodied in Rule 1.6 :

A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the
client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out
the representation or the disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).

Our fundamental values embodied by our Rules of Professional Conduct also require candor
towards the tribunal, the judges. Candor means openness and complete honesty. It is a core
value that may never be broken under any circumstances. Should it violate your duty of loyalty
to your client, you are required to withdraw from representation, rather than ever be
dishonest and closed to the presiding judge. Here are the exact words of this most important of
rules, Rule 3.3 :

(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:

(1) make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of
material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer; . . .

(3) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. . . .â€�

Our core values as lawyers also require fairness to the opposing party in litigation and
fairness to the opposing counsel. This means, among other things, that games of
hide-the-ball are forbidden. This does not mean that you should provide evidence harmful to
your client that was not requested, or not relevant, or that you are not legally required to
produce such as privileged information. But if it was requested, is relevant, and you are
legally required to produce it, it is unethical not to do so. If the client refuses to do so, you
should withdraw. Rule 3.4 states:

A lawyer shall not:

(a) unlawfully obstruct another partyâ€™s access to evidence or otherwise unlawfully
alter, destroy, or conceal a document or other material that the lawyer knows or reasonably
should know is relevant to a pending or a reasonably foreseeable proceeding; nor counsel or
assist another person to do any such act.

(b) falsify evidence, counsel or assist a witness to testify falsely, or offer an inducement
to a witness that is prohibited by law;

(c) knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal, except for an open refusal
based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists;

(d) in pretrial procedure, make a frivolous discovery request or fail to make reasonably
diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party.

This last point is sub-section (d) of 3.4 is specifically directed to discovery requests and
will be closely examined in our concluding hypothetical.

Brief Analysis of the Rules

    To summarize our review of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, six rules seems
    especially important to the field of e-discovery:

    1 - Rule 1.1 â€“ Competence

    

    2 - Rule 1.3 â€“ Diligence

    

    3 - Rule 1.6 – Confidentiality

    

    4 - Rule 3.2 â€“ Expediting Litigation

    

    5 - Rule 3.3 â€“ Candor Toward the Tribunal

    

    6 - Rule 3.4 â€“ Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel

    



Rules 1.3 and 1.6, competence and confidentiality, are often considered client related
duties, whereas the other rules listed above are considered professional duties. I examined
the inherent tension between these rules in Lawyers Behaving Badly, which I illustrated with
several diagrams.

My article suggests that many lawyers neglect their professional duties, and instead
over-inflate client duties instead of crafting a careful balance. I speculate that one
reason for this imbalance is that the discharge of client-centric duties tends to receive
immediate financial rewards from appreciative, perhaps over-impressed, clients. On the
other hand, the reputation gains and societal values from fulfillment of professional
duties are more long term and abstract. In the hope that a picture actually may be worth a
thousand words, and so spare you unnecessary reading at this time, I provide these diagrams
below. I suggest you seek the original article for a full explanation should your curiosity be
stimulated.

Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ethics-duality-imbalance.jpg?w=300&h=127

Attorney competence, Rule 1.1, is such a powerful forces in our legal tradition, that it is an
over-simplification to look solely at the problem of ethics in e-discovery in a dualistic
manner – client versus profession – as the above diagrams suggest. Another element of
complexity must be added to get a better understanding of the problem. Competence should be
understood as its own ethical force, and the issue should be triangulated as shown below.



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ethics-triangle.jpg?w=300&h=202

This three-fold structural analysis allows for a deeper understanding of the true dynamics
of legal practice. Legal competence serves as an independent upward force, along with
professional duties, to counter-balance the pressures and temptations involved with
fulfillment of duties to clients. The forces of law and profession work hand-in-hand to
offset the demands of some clients, typically implied, to prevail over their adversaries at
all costs.

http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/wicked-quad-y-small.jpg?w=225&h=240

Most of the time the temptations of greed and power do not cause “lawyers to behave badly.”
Certainly, lawyers do not make a practice of lying to courts and opposing counsel, even though
they could probably get away with it in many instances and maximize their income in the
process. There is more to this picture than simple economics. The law, after all, attracts
many who are concerned with justice and care about doing the right thing. Most lawyers have
strong moral fiber and need little encouragement to do the right thing. They are more than
pen-and-quill mercenaries . Integrity, professional pride, and competence temper their
financial motivations. Moreover, some enlightened clients recognize and financially
reward professional competence and are influenced by professional reputation in the lawyer
selection and compensation processes.

Cooperation

The strategy demanded in e-discovery when it is performed competently, is fundamentally
different than traditional adversarial strategy for courtroom arguments. It involves
cooperation on discovery, buttressed by liberal disclosure by both sides (party requesting
information, and party responding to the discovery requests). The need for this new
strategy, and the name given therefore of cooperation , was initiated by Richard Braman, the
founder of the Sedona Conference. Richard set forth this Sedona initiative in a press
conference followed by a written, online Sedona Conference Cooperation Proclamation
(2008). This is a brief document of only two and a half pages. It is well summarized by its
conclusion, which states:

It is time to build upon modern Rules amendments, state and federal, which address
e-discovery. Using this springboard, the legal profession can engage in a comprehensive
effort to promote pre-trial discovery cooperation. Our â€œofficer of the
courtâ€� duties demand no less. This project is not utopian; rather, it is a tailored
effort to effectuate the mandate of court rules calling for a â€œjust, speedy, and
inexpensive determination of every actionâ€� and the fundamental ethical principles
governing our profession.

Although the proclamation was short, it was elaborated at length in The Case for Cooperation ,
10 Sedona Conf. J. 339 (2009 Supp.) The article was written by a group of Sedona contributors
led by Bill Butterfield of Hausfeld LLP.Â  The executive editors were Richard G. Braman and
Kenneth J. Withers, both of The Sedona ConferenceÂ®. This initial proclamation and
article were followed by case law where all of the leading e-discovery judges weighed in with
their strong support of the new doctrine, and many more articles. Â  Mancia v. Mayflower
Textile Services Co. 253 F.R.D. 354 (D.Md. Oct. 15, 2008) (landmark case on cooperation by
Judge Paul Grimm that details the basis in the rules and reasonable, ethical practice for a
cooperative approach to discovery, especially e-discovery); Losey, R., Mancia v.
Mayflower Begins a Pilgrimage to the New World of Cooperation, 10 Sedona Conf. J. 377 (2009
Supp.) (reviews initial case law adopting the Cooperation Proclamation); Gensler, S., The
Bullâ€™s-Eye View of Cooperation in Discovery , 10 Sedona Conf. J. 363 (2009 Supp.)
(Professor Gensler provides a scholarly basis and analysis of the new doctrine and its
benefits to litigants); Also see DeGeer v. Gillis , 2010 WL 5096563 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 8, 2010) (J.
Nolan) (found that the absence of a “spirit of cooperation [and] efficiency” was the
controlling factor in determining whether cost shifting was warranted for discovery of
nonparty ESI).

The cooperation challenge is still beyond the skill of most attorneys, at least when it comes
to making e-discovery related decisions and communications. The competence weakness in
turn limits the restraints on unethical conduct.Â  The hardest ethical decisions have to
be made where you are not sure what to do. As practitioners of e-discovery improve their
technical competence, they realize that the cooperative model must be employed to focus on
the issues and to control costs. I have yet to meet an experienced attorney in this field who
does not agree with this proposition, one who knows both discovery and trial Practice.

Hypothetical

Let us assume for purposes of this hypothetical that the attorneys for one side, the defendant
employer in a class action case, have shifted to the new paradigm of Cooperation, and the
attorneys for the other side, here the plaintiffsâ€™ counsel, have not. This means
plaintiffsâ€™ counsel are still stuck in the old school attitude of attacking all of the
other sideâ€™s proposals without first considering their merits, without any
objective analysis of reasonability.

They do this because they assume that if the other side wants something, then it must be bad for
their side. They assume that any proposal is not genuine, that it is instead a
gross-exaggeration of the other sideâ€™s real position. They assume anti-Solomon
attitudes where the baby will be split. For that reason they say 1,000 is their bottom line,
whereas in fact the reasonable number, which they well know, is 10 not 1,000. They begin at
1,000 even though they know that 10 is proportional. They do not cooperate. They negotiate.
They want to win, and most will do so at all costs without regard to the unnecessary attorney
fees thereby incurred.

Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/shark-lawyers.gif?w=300&h=189

Unfortunately, in e-discovery most attorneys are still stuck in the non-cooperative
win/lose discovery battle. They mistakenly think that it is their job to not only argue the law
and application of the law to the given facts, but also to try to change the given facts, to hide
and obfuscate facts they think are adverse to their client.

This fundamental difference in attitude towards discovery makes the position of the
cooperator , here defense counsel, very difficult. The solution is largely one of education
of opposing counsel, or failing that, the court.

An objective reasonable discussion should resolve all issues, especially if there is a fair
measure of transparency to the process. This must remain the goal of all cooperative counsel
in order to protect their clients from excessive costs and disputes.

Next assume that plaintiffsâ€™ counsel makes a very broad demand for production of
email using the old school, win-lose negotiation methods. Assume they make demand for the
relevant emails from 50 custodians, naming everyone and their uncle that might possibly have
anything to do with the dispute in question. They also purport to define relevancy very
broadly by making 50 category demands on a wide variety of subjects, many with only a nebulous
connection to the factual issues of the case. They do so knowing that at most 10 custodians are
likely to really know anything, but they are not sure exactly who they are, and for that reason
they name the larger group of 50. They are also not sure of the real issues of fact in the case yet,
largely because they have never talked with opposing counsel. Since they do not have a clear
idea of the issues in the case, they define relevancy very broadly with 50 categories of
documents.

The new paradigm attorneys, here defense counsel, quickly realize when they attempt real
communication with plaintiffsâ€™ counsel on issues of e-discovery, that they are
dealing with old school negotiators. It quickly becomes obvious to experienced e-discovery
counsel when opposing counsel has little or no personal competence in the area. You cannot
hide that, no matter how many experts you may hire to guide you.

Defense counsel quickly realized that no true communications were likely, that they were
engaged in a traditional negotiation process with Plaintiffâ€™s counsel. But rather
than accept and play the game by say offering 3 custodians and 5 issues, hoping to settle for 5
and 7, defense counsel lays out their case for five custodians and seven issues. They play a new
game, a cooperative game of reasoned discussion and informed decisions. Defense counsel
makes disclosure and explains why they consider the 5/7 offer to be reasonable. They explain
why they think the offer that would be beneficial to all parties.



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/sharks-lasers.jpg?w=210&h=166 Next
assume that plaintiffsâ€™ counsel are unpersuaded by defense counsel, that they
respond with little or no substance, and instead demand 30/30, instead of 50/50, arguing that
they have now made major concessions, and thus suggesting or signaling that they will accept
20 custodians and 20 issues. They assume, incorrectly, that defense counsel is like them,
that the 5/7 proposal was just the opening offer in a negotiation dance. They did not really
care about the reasons stated by defendants for the proposal, and, truth be told, they did not
really understand most of the e-discovery technical talk surrounding the issues. They were
hardball trial lawyers; tough advocates doing their job by pounding out as much information
from the other side as they could. They thought it would help their clients to make the
defendantâ€™s case as expensive as possible. They knew e-discovery was a good way to do
that, and knew from past experience that this oppose everything tactic was a good way to drive
up the settlement value of the case. Discovery, especially e-discovery, was just another
tool in the battle against the other side.

Next assume defendants continue to refuse to play the negotiation game, and hearing no real
reasons for them to think their original calculation of 5 custodians and 7 issues is wrong,
press forwards in their demands for 5/7. They ask for reasons and calm discussion from
plaintiffsâ€™ counsel, but instead receive rhetoric and negotiation bluster.
Accusatory letters are exchanged, the real purpose of which are not true communications, but
mere posturing, mere creation of exhibits for use in motion practice.

The court is then asked to consider cross-motions for relief on a variety of complex
e-discovery issues. Both sides claim that they are the true cooperator, and that the opposing
party, not them, is to blame for the impasse. What should a judge then do? How do you tell the true
cooperator from the mere poser? Both sides claim to be cooperators, and one side did make a
major move in custodian and issue count, whereas the other did not. From the negotiation
perspective, it looks like plaintiffâ€™s counsel is being more cooperative. Whereas
we know that they are not cooperating at all, they are not even communicating or attempting to
narrow the issues. How is a savvy judge to sort things out?

The answer lies in probing the merits of the dispute. This requires the judge to also break out
of the old negotiation paradigm, to look beyond the facial numbers. Â Why are five
custodians reasonable and proportional, and twenty custodians too much? Why should
relevancy be defined by seven issues, and not twenty? It is not a mere numbers game, as
plaintiffsâ€™ counsel in this scenario would suggest. The court must do the hard work of
examining the merits of the dispute, of determining what is reasonable and proportional for
the case, and what is not. The court should refuse to buy into the old paradigm negotiation
model, and just split the difference and enter an order allowing 12 custodians and 14 issues.
The judge should instead examine the facts in an objective manner, and if 5 custodians and 7
issues are indeed reasonable, should rule accordingly.

This takes time and hard work on the judgeâ€™s part, and on part of the attorneys who frame
the issues and present the case. They need to provide meat for the bone. They need to make
disclosures and present facts to support their positions.

In the hypothetical let us further assume that defense counsel realized their quandary and
voluntarily made substantial disclosures. Assume they disclosed their own mental
impressions, their work product as to why the five custodians they picked would have the most
relevant email. Assume they also provided total counts and other metrics of email for the five
custodians they proposed. Moreover, assume the defendant also provided counts for the
additional fifteen custodians that plaintiffsâ€™ proposed.

Assume the defendant make even further disclosures to support their argument of
reasonability and proportionality. Assume they presented detailed information
concerning the costs of the review and production proposed by plaintiffs, as compared to
their proposal. Assume it was not puffed or inflated and was supported by facts, which they
offered to backup with further testimony if needed.

Assume defendants went even further and began to make sample productions from the top five
custodians they picked, and that they did so after a strong confidentiality and clawback
order was entered by the court. Assume the emails produced showed that most of the other
fifteen custodians that plaintiffs wanted to add at great additional cost were copied on most
of the relevant documents.

Assume defense counsel even made some random sample productions from all twenty custodians
to show that the top five they had selected had the vast majority of the relevant documents, and
were the only source of the few highly relevant documents found. Assume they not only produced
the documents they marked relevant, but also made a selective disclosure of documents they
marked irrelevant to provide the plaintiffs with an opportunity to review and if need be, to
challenge their understanding of relevancy in this case.

Assume that defense counsel was also proposing phased production. That they only insisted
their 5/7 approach be for the first phase, and that they did not insist plaintiffs waive their
rights to seek additional document productions in follow-up phases. Instead, assume the
defendants only sought to clarify that they reserved their rights to object to any future
discovery, or not, depending on the circumstances.

With all of these additional facts, these voluntary disclosures, the judgeâ€™s work
becomes much easier. The judge now has the information, the facts, on which to make a ruling.
The defendant has made significant disclosures of their clientâ€™s email systems, and
even of their email contents. Now the judge is in a position to determine whose position is
reasonable, and who is the true cooperator here. This information provides the substance
needed for the judge to go beyond the negotiation model of discovery dispute resolution to a
true judicial model.



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/sharks-lasers-2.gif?w=154&h=154 Of
course, in the real world all lawyers come before judges with a history. They have a
reputation. This can also help a judge to evaluate â€œwhoâ€™s on firstâ€� and
know who is a poser, and who is not. This is especially true where a judge has seen and heard from
one or more of the lawyers several times before. That is where the intangible value of an
attorneyâ€™s reputation comes in.

I am happy to say that in my experience when most judges are faced with this situation, and
properly advised of the issues, they will do the hard work and make their own determination of
reasonability. They will not simply split the baby and order 12 custodians and 14 issues. But
this requires proper education of judges on the issues, which in turn requires competent
counsel with a good reputation for truth, honesty and fair dealing. If defense counsel in this
scenario are competent, and so is the judge, a just and reasoned result will usually be
attained, regardless of any overly-clever negotiation tactics of plaintiffsâ€™
counsel.

END OF PART ONE.

In Part Two I will analyze this hypothetical using the six key Rules of Professional Conduct.

Ethics Interview

August 21, 2010





Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/justice.jpg?w=450 There can be
no real justice without truth, and in today’s world of civil litigation, no real truth
without e-discovery. That is because writings are the key evidence in most cases and almost
all writings today are electronic. The paper documents we see are mere shadows of the original
ESI; small tips of vast icebergs of electronic truth. Yet lawyers continue to settle for the
few paper remnants scattered about a controversy and avoid search of these depths. This realm
is beyond their training, beyond their competence. So they agree between themselves not to go
there, or if forced, they delegate the task to vendors. They abdicate the traditional role of
lawyer as master of discovery. This is a disservice to the profession and the clients we serve.

This situation is getting worse each day, not better, as ESI grows exponentially in volume and
complexity. It has created a crises for the legal profession. It is not a crises of poor rules as
some contend, and thus revising the rules again is no solution. It is a crises of competence,
and as such it is an ethical crises. It is time we owned up to the problem and did something about
it. We have an ethical duty to act. The solution is clear. Education and training, combined
with recognition and affiliation of experts where competence has not been attained.

Fundamental to professional ethics is the duty to keep the dispute resolution process fair
and honest. Controversies must be settled on their merits based on the facts and the law.
Moreover, lawyers must put the interest of their clients ahead of their own personal
interests. These are the two core truths of attorney ethics. In electronic discovery, we are
failing on both fronts.

Can a lawsuit be fair if only one side has an attorney competent to explore the electronic
depths, to uncover the truth of what happened? Is the process fair if the attorneys on both
sides lack the competence to find the facts hidden in the electronic writings? If the
attorneys agree not to look behind the paper curtain and try a case without knowing the
electronic truths, is that a fair trial for anyone? If e-discovery in a case is too arcane and
complex for an attorney to handle, do they have a duty to share the burden of representation
with another attorney who is competent in this field?

Attorneys must put aside their personal pecuniary interest and act in the best interests of
the client. If they are not yet competent in e-discovery, or if they have limited competence
and face a problem beyond their means, they must retain co-counsel who is able, rather than
avoid it or do it negligently. They have an ethical duty to do so, even though this will lower
their fees or prove embarrassing to their false pride. The interests of the client must always
come first.

In the medical profession, no physician, barring an extreme emergency, would dream of
attempting a procedure for which they were not trained and not competent. They would of course
affiliate another physician in their patient’s care who had the expertise needed. They
would not just retain a vendor, say a drug company, to tell them what to do. They would enlist the
assistance of a peer, of another professional subject to the same duties of ethics and
professionalism, not to mention malpractice insurance. Is the legal profession subject to a
lower standard? I think not. It is time we started living up to it.

Society is complicated. Law and dispute resolution are in many cases today, if not most cases,
nearly as complex as the problems faced by medicine. Specialists are needed in substantive
areas of law and in procedural areas. The day has come for e-discovery to be recognized as its
own speciality. This does not mean that all e-discovery tasks are beyond the pale of trial
attorneys. The modern litigation generalist can, with sufficient time and attention, learn
the fundamentals of e-discovery and handle many of the basic tasks on their own, including
management of vendors.

Still, most have not yet done so. It takes more than a couple of CLEs and books. Until litigators
get there, they have an ethical duty to enlist theÂ assistanceÂ of other attorneys who
have. Moreover, in large more complex cases, an e-discovery specialist attorney will always
be needed to manage and supervise the process and personally handle the most difficult tasks.
The facts and issues can be too complex and time consuming to be performed competently by
part-time e-discoveryÂ practitioners.

ESI Bytes Interview



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/karl-schieneman.jpg?w=450
Since ethics and e-discovery are, in my view, critical topics for all litigators today, when I
was contacted byÂ Karl Schieneman (shown left) for another interview, I agreed, but only
if we would limit the discussion to ethics. (I have previously done an interview by Karl with
Judge Scheindlin focused on education.) Karl, whose day-job is the Director of Legal
Analytics and Review at Jurinnov, readily agreed. A lengthy one-hour plus podcast interview
resulted, which you can listen to and download at the ESIBytes web. My blog this week, and next,
will consist of an edited, shortened, and hyper-linked version of this interview. Â Also,
by popular demand, I will again include < my secret thoughts to self >, or some of them at least,
that occurred to me during this interview, much like I did with the Mary Mack interview. I will
skip over the interview introductions and get right to the substance.

THE INTERVIEW

KARL: … Ralph, great to have you back on a second show with us.



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/losey-photo-miami-cle.jpg?w=450
RALPH: Great to be here, Karl. Â < You’ve gotta be easier on me than Mary Mack. > I like
speaking with you and appreciate the opportunity to get the message out there to as many people
as possible about the importance of ethics in e-discovery.

KARL: This is a topic that really the more you get into e-discovery becomes apparent as just
crying out for attention and you’ve blogged about this topic before.Â  You recently gave
a presentation at Mercer University with Judge Facciola, Jason Baron, Professor Monroe
Freedman and others on ethics of electronic discovery.Â  Tell me a little bit about that
conference, which just focused on the ethics.

RALPH: I’d be happy to.Â  It was really quite an incredible, very well run, good
conference at Mercer, which is located just south of Atlanta in Macon, Georgia.Â 
Beautiful campus, and we had two full days for aÂ seminar put on by the Law Review there. < Boy
do I sound like a flatter; better shut up.> I believe it was the first academic seminar to
address the issues of ethics in e-discovery and also in â€“ there was some other
presentations on ethics involving the onâ€‘line provision of legal services and
advertising,Â that sort of thing. < All I can remember of the non-e-discovery stuff was
their talk about a former Playboy playmate turned lawyer in Illinois who includes “special
photos” in her law web and I am not going to start talking about that!> But the focus was on
e-discovery. < Must stop thinking about that Illinois lawyer. >

In fact, this first came up about a year ago, Karl â€“ it’s been that long in gestation. <
I am talking about the e-discovery ethics seminar of course. > In reading all of the cases in
eâ€‘discovery, where there’s just case after case of lawyers being sanctioned …
the latest one is, you know, a law firm alone being sanctioned ( Bray & Gillespie v. Lexington
Ins. ), not the client, for misconduct in eâ€‘discovery.Â  This seemed quite
puzzling to me in that, you know, I’ve been a lawyer a long time â€“ since 1980 â€“
and you didn’t see many sanction cases in the ’80s and ’90s against lawyers.Â  I mean,
they would come up, but spoliation was a pretty rare thing. Â So, I got to wondering, you
know, what is going on?Â  Has the legal profession suddenly become less ethical?Â 
Nowadays in the 2000s, are we behaving with lower moral standards than we did in the ’80s and
the ’90s. < I was there and learned from many older attorneys and so I know that’s not true. >

I was really trying to figure out why is it that there’s so many sanction cases and that
lawyers are being reprimanded so often now, and particularly in the field of
eâ€‘discovery.Â  I mean, I think this is the field, and nobody’s ever challenged me
on it, where you’ve got more sanction cases involving lawyers than any other field of
law.Â  I found it quite puzzling.

KARL: You know, I’ve found if you say something like that enough times, it becomes true.
People believe it.

RALPH: Well, yeah â€“ no, I would love to see another area of law that has more problems
than we do in eâ€‘discovery, but I haven’t seen it.

KARL: I won’t challenge you on it, but why do you think this is growing? Because I don’t
disagree, honestly, but why do you think this area is growing with ethical issues?

RALPH: Well, this was the puzzler. < Hope he gives me time because this is going to take a while to
answer properly .> And so I started thinking about it, you know, and this is a big problem and
it’s not something that just happens overnight. Â And then I got an invitation from the
Dean at Mercer Law School, who said they were organizing this event and … we came up with a
dream team, several of them were available, including Judge Facciola, Jason R. Baron, and the
person that I now coâ€‘teach eâ€‘discovery with at the University of Florida Law
School, and that is Bill Hamilton.Â  He came up there.Â  And then we got Judge David Baker,
who’s a Magistrate Judge in Orlando, well known and rightfully so for his writing of the
eâ€‘discovery opinion,Â  In Re Seroquel. Judge Baker is the only person I know
who’s been messing with computers longer than I have.Â  He goes back to the early and mid
’70s, so he’s very much of a technophile.

We had this kind of dream team of people that were all â€“ you know, we had months to prepare
for this event and trying to think out the whole question of ethics.Â  Jason gave a
presentation â€“ the way it works is in an academic setting, you make a presentation and
then the panel members sort of comment on it. Jason made a very interesting presentation
concerning ethics related to search, as you might expect, and it had to do with asymmetric
knowledge is the way he called it. In other words, when you represent a client as a lawyer over
and over again or if you’re inâ€‘house counsel, you become very familiar with their
information and you know basically â€“ you have a much better idea of what’s in their
information, certainly far better than opposing counsel does. What kind of ethical duties
does that create to assist opposing counsel in their search for relevant information? This
was the thesis that Jason explored and that was followed up upon by Judge Facciola in a whole
area of discussion.

My area of discussion, though, got back to this puzzling question: why are lawyers behaving
badly? < That is supposed to be funny Karl. How about at least a chuckle? Maybe he’s never
heard of the show? > Kind of a take-off on the popular television show. < Still no laughs. Oh
well. Maybe he’s texting or something ?> I came up with this thing that I called the wicked
quadrant , which is four different factors that I believe explain why it is that all of a sudden
there’s so many lawyers being sanctioned in the field of eâ€‘discovery. So I gave a
presentation on that.

In the meantime, I also wrote a law review article further elaborating on my thoughts, and
that’s going to be published by the Mercer Law Review, coming out soon in their next 2009
edition.Â  The other thing Mercer did, which is fascinating and I suggest you try and get a
hold of this, they made a transcript of the entire proceeding. So you can read Judge
Facciola’s speech on this, you can read what Jason had to say about the duty to assist
opposing counsel.Â  You can read what I had to say and everybody, including â€“ by the
way, the keynote speaker, who was none of us.

Professor Freedman and Metadata



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/monroe-freedman.jpg?w=450
The keynote speech was given by a legend in academic circles called Professor Monroe
Freedman, and he is about â€“ I don’t know â€“ late 70s.Â  Very vigorous < Tried
to beak my hand when he shook it. > and known for his controversiality.Â  He spoke
aboutÂ the ethics of metadata. He thinks that you have a duty to try and find out what your
opposing counsel’s metadata is in emails and correspondence they send you.Â  In spite of
the fact that many state bar associations say it’s unethical, Professor Freedman takes the
controversial view that you have a duty to mine metadata.Â  And so that’s also in the
transcript.Â  A very fascinating discussion about that.Â  In fact I got into a big
argument with Professor Freedman about that as I don’t think that’s proper to do when
you’re talking about correspondence between lawyers.Â  But he has a strong position,
saying that it is in fact a duty to your client to try and do that.

KARL: Is Professor Freedman an attorney as well or just an academic?

RALPH: Oh, boy, they hate it when you say just an academic. < Karl, you can now kissÂ any
possible academic career goodbye! >Â Yeah, he is an attorney â€“ as a matter of fact he
represents lawyers that get in trouble with bar associations. And he’s written several
textbooks on the ethics of law and is a guy that you might retain if you had a problem ethically in
front of a state board. So yeah, he does practice law, but very controversial. One appeals
court judge … who later became a supreme court justice … was on a campaign to have Professor
Monroe Freedman disbarred because he was controversial back in the ’60s and ’70s. He
survived. It’s quite entertaining to read what he had to say.Â  So look out for that, the
Mercer Law Review with the full transcript.

KARL: Okay.

RALPH I’ll probably blog about that or Twitter about it or something to let people know
because I think it’s interesting to hear this kind of discussion.Â  Believe me, no
punches were pulled.

The Wicked Quadrant



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/wicked-quadrant.png?w=450 So
anyway, I wrote this law review article called The Wicked Quadrant that will also be included
in the publication, and you know, I’m honored to be in there with Judge Facciola and
Professor Freedman and Jason and all of them. Â I won’t go into the details, but I will just
tell you what the four elements of the quadrant are. … I find there’s a lot of resonance and
understanding among the general bar, nonspecialists in e-discovery, concerning
ethics.Â  They get ethics and understand the duty of legal competence. They know that’s
the fundamental challenge that we’re facing here.

One of the four sections of the quadrant is that we all have a duty to keep up.Â  We have a duty to
learn the new law and like it or not, part of that is â€“ in litigation –
e-discovery.Â  So we’ve got to take the time to train ourselves to be competent in this
field.Â The fact that the bar as a whole is not really doing that is one of the problems and
leads to this appearance of impropriety.Â  A lot of the impropriety is from not knowing what
they were doing, and they were making mistakes.Â  It may look like intentional bad faith,
but actually they’re just screwing up because they didn’t know any better.

KARL: Yeah, you know, I’ve found that in law.Â  I mean, if you think back to when you started
as a lawyer, this is where — when I was reading this was my â€“ what I first thought
about.Â  I remember that first year summer associate at a downtown law firm being asked to
research something.Â  And it was almost as if everything I learned in legal writing
disappeared from my mind.Â  I walked into the library and I thought, what do I do?Â  And I
must have killed a lot of time.Â  I didn’t want to tell anyone I didn’t know how to start
it.Â  And, you know, I got â€“ got through the project but â€“ but it was â€“
it’s almost like you’re not rewarded or there’s this fear of saying I don’t
understand this, you know, when it’s the first time you try something.Â  And that
â€“ you know, I don’t know if it’s the way lawyers are rewarded.Â  You know, I’ve
often heard partner, making partner, is a lot about never screwing up.Â  Anyway, I’m
sorry to interrupt you.

RALPH. < Huh? What was that all about. > No, it’s â€“ you know, when I got out of law
school, the UCC had just been enacted a couple years before. None of the older lawyers knew the
UCC and it was a tremendous opportunity for young lawyers to make a contribution immediately.
That’s the same situation we’re in now. When you and I did the show before it was on
education, so you’ve heard me talk about this before. Young lawyers just getting out of law
school now or just starting practice, there’s a tremendous opportunity for you if you can
get the competence necessary because a lot of the older attorneys â€“ the ones that are my
age â€“ they’re just not going to take the time and it’s just inherently difficult
for them.

I started thinking about it and it is more than just a question of legal competence; it’s also
a question of technology competence. That is a key part of the quadrant, the four factors to
understand why lawyers are screwing up and behaving badly, is because they’re just
overwhelmed by the technology. Most lawyers don’t get it, they don’t understand
Facebook, they don’t really understand how email works, how deletion works, they don’t
know what double-deletion means. There’s just a lot of things that are confusing to them.
This technology incompetence leads them to do dumb things in cases like say, “Oh yeah,
we’ll review that back-up tape and produce the relevant emails to you next week, Your
Honor” when of course they have no clue that there’s 10 million emails on that back-up
tape. They just â€“ they don’t know really what they’re talking about. So that’s a
big part of the explanation is that we’re in an unprecedented explosion in technological
advances. A lot of us lawyers are having trouble keeping up with the ever changing information
revolution. < Well, to be honest, for me it still feels like slow motion, especially when using
a PC. > So that’s another part of the quadrant.



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/ethics-duality-imbalance-small1.jpg?w=450

And then just real quickly, the other two quadrant sectors are the ethics rulesÂ â€“
and we’ll get into this in a minute â€“ where you have the client advocacy duties
balanced by the professional duties to tell the truth to the court and the dutyÂ to opposing
counsel to cooperate. That hasn’t been getting enough attention among lawyers until very
recently with Judge Grimm and the Sedona Cooperation Proclamation . Â The professional
duties have been over-shadowed by that other very popular duty to vigorously advocate on your
client’s behalf.Â  That has gotten out of hand onÂ occasionÂ and that’s the
other part of the explanation. Because this is the kind of thing clients understand; they see
when you are shouting on their behalf and they may reward that financially.Â  But they
don’t understand why it is that you may have a duty to disclose email that’s going to hurt
their case and you have a duty to cooperate. So that gets less financial rewards. I get into the
economics involved in all of this as well.

Again, I don’t want to get into too much detail except to say the law review articleÂ is
coming out soon and if you have my second book, Introduction to E-Discovery , Chapter 6 begins
with a version of this same article. … from page 385 all the way to 404. … Â Then in the book
I get into all of the lessons of Qualcom , which of course is the big … eâ€‘discovery
ethics case of the decade. Â Let’s hope there aren’t any cases worse than Qualcomm .

ABA Model Rule 1.1 of ProfessionalÂ Conduct

KARL: Yep, that’s true. All right, well let’s â€“ let’s go through some of the
rules here. Rule 1.1, Competence , of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct says a lawyer
shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the
legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the
representation. Okay, how do we get in trouble here with ethics and eâ€‘discovery?

RALPH: This is the core problem and this is, you know, why we need more and better training. The
problem is,Â e-discovery isn’t taught in 95% of the law schools, so lawyers are coming
out of law school with no information on it, no eâ€‘discovery competence. And in most law
firms, except for a very few, typically the larger law firms â€“ in most law firms, there
are no eâ€‘discovery lawyers that have done this for years and have gained competence in
it one way or the other. So people are all sort of floundering around, which is why your radio
show is so important and other educational efforts like that. < A little flattery of the
interviewer never hurts. >

People, you know, they need the information out there. It’s why CLEs for
eâ€‘discovery continue to be filled even in these rough economic times. People
understand that they need to learn this because the whole notion of discovery, it’s now all
eâ€‘discovery. Very few writings are created on paper, so 98, 99 percent of our writings
today are electronically generated.Â  Some of them are printed out < Yeah, like that
Illinois lawyer. No, must stop thinking about that! >, but a relatively small percentage.
Usually the hottest information in any case is going to be the inadvertent information in the
electronic mails, the text messages, the instant messages, that short of thing, where people
are still saying, you know, incredibly dumb things. < Or including things on their legal web
banned in most states .> So to ignore electronic information is to ignore writings. <W ritings
include photographs you know, all kinds of photographs .> You just can’t conduct
litigation < or Bar ethics investigations in Illinois > in a competent manner and not look at
all of your writings, not look at the original electronic versions of writings instead of just
relying upon, you know, what the client may happen to print out and say, “here, take a look at
this.”

One of my favorite cases I like to talk about, maybe because it’s a Florida case and not
everyone knows about it, is Martin v. Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. That’s a
2006 Westlaw case, 148991, Middle District of Florida, where the plaintiff’s attorney, he
was suing for disability benefits.Â  He produced paper that his client â€“ he was
representing another plaintiff’s attorney … and they said ‘that’s all we got; those
are all the writings we have.’ Â The insurance company, Northwestern Mutual,
eventually proved that that was wrong. They eventually found that they had several thousand
pages of email and other records that weren’t produced.Â  And so they were called in front
of the Magistrate Judge on a sanctions motion, and the plaintiff’s excuse was, “I’m
sorry, Judge, but me and my client, we’re both computer illiterate .Â  We didn’t really
know how to get to that sort of stuff.”

Believe me, this excuse has been used for a long time in courts. It’s still used today in state
courts all over the country. But in federal court, and when he did it in 2006, the response of
Judge Pizo was to call that “frankly ludicrous.”Â  That’s a quote.Â  Judges
don’t usually call what counsel says ludicrous. < Of course, they think it all of the time,
but you have to be incredibly bad for them to actually come out and say it. > Â Here the judge
said it the writing; sanctions were imposed against theÂ plaintiff. This case represents
the death knell of this whole, “gee, judge, I didn’t know” as a valid way to avoid doing
your job and finding the writings, even though they haven’t been printed out. Â This “
frankly ludicrous ” reaction is what I think you’re going to find in every federal court in
the country now. They’re just not going to put up with this excuse of I didn’t know how to do
it.Â  Although, honestly, we all know it still goes on in state court. But it’s only a
matter of time before the state courts won’t put up with it either. < Please! >

KARL: You know, drilling just a little bit deeper into the competence issue, because
there’s just so many areas where this can come up.Â  You know, the podcast that you blogged
a little bit about that I did with Judge Facciola and Tom French, we got into the economics.Â 
And, you know, this is going to cost a little bit of money sometimes to do this.Â  And Tom
French on the plaintiff’s time said, well, if you can’t afford it, you shouldn’t be
doing it.Â  You know, he came right out and said that’s an ethical obligation that you have
as the lawyers not to take the case if you can’t afford to do it right and to look at the data,
which I thought was an interesting thought I hadn’t really thought about too much, to tell
you the truth.

RALPH: Well, that’s a rare breath of fresh air and honesty. But, you know, a lot of
plaintiff’s lawyers don’t look at it that way. <Some will take any case that walks through
the door. > A lot of defense lawyers don’t look at it that way. < They won’t admit they
can’t do e-discovery either and so they just make a terrible muck of things .> Â In fact,
what we’ve had â€“ what we’ve seen â€“ this is me getting controversial here
for a minute â€“ we’ve seen lawyers abdicate their responsibility to vendors. <Oh
well, just lost half of the vendors with that remark. Hope it does not piss off Karl. > Now, I know
you work for a vendor, too, so you’ve seen it, but you don’t have to give â€“ you
don’t have to make any comments, but you know rather than their figuring out how to do it,
they’ll hire somebody else to do it and these vendors will end up making a lot of legal
decisions. < I just love consultants who say, I’m not allowed to give legal advice, but … >
And the lawyers don’t really have a clue what they’re doing. < Better tryÂ now to get out
of the big hole I have just dug myself into .> Now your company is, I know, one of the good ones and
they’re honest, but you and I know that they’re not all like that and that vendors are in
business to make money. So what they end up doing is over-review, they look at too many
documents. The vendors are not really helping to keep the expenses down because it’s not in
their best interest to do so. < Of course, the lawyers love it too. They are happy to be mislead.
More review equals more billings. The only one that loses is the client, but no one has told them
what is really going on. >

I think that one of the real reasons e-discovery is too expensive is that lawyers don’t know
how to do it right and so they over-delegate it to vendors that don’t have the same motivation
as a lawyer might to save the client money. < I bet you will never see this quote in the vendor
driven e-discovery media .>

KARL: One other area of competence I want your thoughts on a little bit is you mentioned the
split between large and mid-size law firms, between those who have e-discovery groups or, you
know, focus lawyers that understand e-discovery, and those that don’t. Isn’t it also a
battle even with the structure, say you’ve done it right and you have that competence
established, to get every lawyer to pick up the phone when they have a matter and say, “hey, I
may have an issue here”?

RALPH: Yeah, it’s â€“ it’s a real educational challenge. < He’s baiting me here.
Probably pissed about my vendor slams. Got to be careful. > The large firms, like my firm, we
have the advantage in that, you know, we can have a few people become an expert in it. But then we
have the disadvantage of having literally hundreds of litigation lawyers and training them
to pick up the phone and do that, that just takes time. Because it’s â€“ you know, it’s
like, can you teach an old dog new tricks?Â  Yes you can, but it takes a lot of effort.
Litigators are used to doing discovery on their own. It’s a hard shock for them to realize
that there may be part of discovery that they can’t handle. They don’t like to admit that,
but slowly they will start to and will turn to specialists for help.

This point was learned recently by a very good firm, Reed Smith, who has some 1500 lawyers,
including some excellent e-discovery lawyers. Yet in the Bray and Gillespie v. Lexington
Insurance case just this March, the law firm itself was sanctioned for e-discovery mistakes.
It was sanctioned for the actions of two of its attorneys, shareholders.Â  It was an Orlando
district court case.Â  And it’s not because they didn’t have the law firm resources;
it’s because they didn’t ask for the help, these two shareholders just did it on their own.

This is the wake up call, the Bray and Gillespie case .Â  I think it’s a huge wake-up call for
law firms to start imposing some discipline in making sure that larger firms actually use the
resources that they’re given.Â  The citation for that by the way is 2009 WestLaw 546429,
Middle District Florida, March 4, 2009.Â Â I think that’s a very important case.Â 
I know my good friend, Browning Marean of DLA Piper thinks this case is more important than the
Qualcomm case because it sends a message to the law firms themselves that you’ve got to make
sure that the knowledge is actually being used. The courts Â are not going to tolerate the
kind of activity that happened in Bray and Gillespie and others which were, in the judge’s
view at least , a clear violation of the rules of what’s required for the format of
production.

Time for a quiz. What do you think?Â Has the issue of attorney competence with e-discovery
reached ethical crises proportions?

Take Our Poll

Diligence

KARL: Okay. Let’s go to another rule here. Another of the client duties â€“ diligence.
Rule 1.3 on diligence says: A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in
representing a client. How do we get in trouble here in e-discovery with that?

RALPH: Well, it’s a big one. I’ve got to credit New Jersey and their local rules for
emphasizing this many years ago when New Jersey began to require counsel to talk right away
with the IT department of the client to make sure that preservation holds are properly
implemented, the auto deletion functions are turned off. The New Jersey rule also requires
counsel appearing in cases in New Jersey to talk right away with the key custodians about
making sure their evidence is preserved.

Then Judge Scheindlin in Zubalake in her opinion in 2004 picked up on that theme out of New
Jersey. She created what I and others are now calling the Zubalake Duty . You’ll see that
written about in my blog and in my books where, in her words â€“ she says, “ outside
counsel are required ‘to make certain that all potentially relevant information are
identified and placed on hold .’” So, she’s actually putting that duty on outside
counsel, not just the client, but on outside counsel, to make sure that the relevant
information has been placed on hold.

This is controversial to many people who think this shouldn’t be an outside lawyer’s job,
that diligence shouldn’t include requiring the attorney to be sure everything is placed on
hold. But under the Zubalake Duty , you are at least required to have the conversations and to
give the advice. Now, if the client doesn’t follow your advice, you’re probably not going
to be sanctioned for that. But on the other hand, you may sometimes be in a Qualcomm situation
where if the client just blatantly doesn’t follow your advice â€“ and, by the way,
I’ve never had this happen to me, but in theory it could happen â€“ then, what you’re
supposed to do is withdraw. <Ralph’s secret thoughts: Well, come to think of it, I have been
in that position before, or close to it, and I have withdrawn, but not over preservation
issues, per se. > That is because you’re not supposed to condone evidence being deleted. <
That’s a big Duh! >

Due diligence requires follow up with the client to tell them about their duties, talk to the
right key people, explain what they have to do to make sure that relevant evidence isn’t
deleted. This is all supposed to happen quickly, which makes it so darn challenging. … So
this is another big problem — the duty of diligence has become a huge challenge,
particularly in e-discovery in connection with preservation.

KARL: You know, I almost feel like I should stop for a fictitious sponsor statement here. < Oh
no. Here it comes, the wine story again! Time to do a quick check of my email .>Â A couple of
years ago I came up with a bottle of wine tied into Zubalake called the Fourth C. There were three
Cs in Zubalake . Jim Daley, a good friend of mine, called it the Zen of Zubalake . You have to
Communicate with your IT people, you gotta Coordinate you know the stopping, the deleting,
etc., and then you gotta Comply with the order. When you mess those up, there’s always
Cabernet, which is my Fourth C. We got Judge Scheindlin and Laura Zubalake to autograph the
bottle. Used to bring them around to conferences. I still think there’s a role as a tool for a
good bottle of wine in e-discovery. Calm everyone down.

RALPH: Yeah…. < W ine as diligence? Not so sure about that one Karl.> and you know, Zubalake is
kind of old news. < I am so sick of saying the Z-word.> Okay, it was five years ago this came out,
but unfortunately the problem is still there.

It’s still a huge challenge and I would like to mention a more recent case, though. < Anything
butÂ Zubu! >Â  One that just came out,Â  Van Alstyne v. Electronic Scriptorium . Great
name for a defendant, huh? < What is a “ Scriptorium ” anyway? > This is a Fourth Circuit
case. So now we’re talking an appellate circuit case which came out on March 18, 2009.
What’s interesting about this is the attorney here just took emails that were given to him
from his client without doing the diligence of asking: “Where did you get those emails? How
is it you came to have the emails of this employee who is suing us now?” Because they were very
personal, private emails. The attorney didn’t really do the diligence required to find out
â€“ at least I assume he didn’t, and there’s no indication in the opinion to indicate
that he knew that these emails were in fact hacked from the employee’s private on-line
account. < I have written about this case before .>



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/monkeys.jpg?w=450

This is a crime and it subjected this defendant company to a punitive damages award even though
there was no proof of any actual damages from having the employee’s private email hacked
into. We all know that here the client was being way too diligent . He figured out a way to get into
the Yahoo! Account. He knew or figured out her user name and password and he stole her email.
Then just turned it over to his attorney, who blithely said, “oh, okay, thanks,” and used
it as surprise on a cross-examination of her deposition. So this is something you’ve got to
understand, the evidence and where it’s coming from. This is just a different kind of
example where the attorney didn’t do his homework and in fact ended up using evidence that
was procured in a criminal manner by his client.

KARL: All right. Thatâ€™s â€“ thatâ€™s â€“ itâ€™s scary stuff.
Iâ€™ve actually encountered something similar. You know, when you know e-discovery
well, you sometimes have friends that ask you questions and in the world of small business,
lots of bad things can happen. So your diligence is right.

RALPH: It is, and those of us that have been around it, I mean we know, itâ€™s not that hard
really to hack into somebodyâ€™s email account. But donâ€™t do it and
donâ€™t let your client do it! Thereâ€™s laws governing these things that need to
restrain lawyers as well.

Confidentiality of Information



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/secretshh.jpg?w=450 KARL:
Yeah. Well letâ€™s go on to Rule 1.6 â€“ Confidentiality of Information. This
falls on the professional duty side of the equation. A lawyer shall not reveal information
relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the
disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation or the
disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b) . Okay. How do we get in trouble here?

RALPH: Thereâ€™s two things that are really hyper about that. One is, we havenâ€™t
talked about the duty of cooperation yet, but it kind of dovetails in with this duty of
confidentiality, particularly in eâ€‘discovery, where sometimes weâ€™re
going to have to disclose to opposing counsel things that we used to keep secret as work
product. < Nothing critical mind you, but stuff needed for CYA .>Â It used to be kept
confidential how you would do your searches. The key words that you might use to search through
your own clientâ€™s data. That typically was something you just wouldnâ€™t share
with the other side. None of their business. Thatâ€™s my work product. Iâ€™m going
to keep it confidential. < Afraid it would give away your theory of the case; more likely it
would give away how lame your searches were. > The other thing is keeping client’s secrets. <
Now those are the important secrets .> In a minute, Iâ€™ll explain how both of these
confidentiality duties kind of dovetailed togetherÂ in the Victor Stanley case.

But the other duty is to not produce to the other side attorney/client communications.
Itâ€™s the clientâ€™s privilege, as you know, to keep things secret. The client
typically instructs you, the lawyer: “Not to turn over our secret emails to each other; I
donâ€™t want to waive that privilege; I donâ€™t want the person who sued me, for
instance, to see what weâ€™ve been talking about in connection with this case or in
connection with anything.” So part of e-discovery, one of the most expensive parts of
eâ€‘discovery, is to review documents that have already been found to be relevant and to
remove from those documents the attorney/client communications. These things are
protected by attorney/client privilege, or all other kinds of privilege. Then also to review
and protect documents that are confidential, that might just be trade secrets of your client
and to protect them in various ways.

Focusing in on the duty to keep the communications between an attorney and their client
secret, which is what this ethical duty is talking about, is a very important duty. This came to
head in the Victor Stanley v. Creative Pipe case. Everybody thatâ€™s an
eâ€‘discovery junkie knows this one by Magistrate Judge Paul Grimm. It was decided
almost a year ago now, May 29, 2008. If you havenâ€™t seen it, youâ€™ll find it
discussed in my books and also in the blog . It also pertained to the reasonable diligence
requirement, in that the people doing that final review of relevant documents to remove
privilege, they missed over 300 privileged documents and they produced them to the other
side. Their duty to keep things confidential was breached at that point. They were then
invited to explain to the court and the other side whether they conducted a reasonable search.
If they were able to prove a reasonable search, they might have been able to prevent the
privilege from being waived.

Thatâ€™s where the other confidentiality concerns reared their ugly head; they in
effect said “Nope, weâ€™re not going to tell you what our search terms were.
Thatâ€™s our work product. Weâ€™re keeping that confidential. Weâ€™re not
revealing it.” So, faced with that scenario where 300 documents were produced and they
claimed it was accidental, but they wouldnâ€™t explain what they did to try and catch
them at all, Judge Grimm found that there was a waiver of the privilege. He did not find that
there had been a quality assurance testing program. Basically, he didnâ€™t find that
what they had done to try and protect the confidentiality of their clientâ€™s
information was reasonable. So that was a duty on the shoulders of the attorney which they
didnâ€™t discharge, and here it cost the client the loss of their privilege.

KARL: I should throw a little plug in there. I havenâ€™t set the date yet, but Judge Grimm
has agreed to do a pod cast talking to one other judge. Want to do something on sort of from a
10,000 foot level search and retrieval from the judgeâ€™s perspective. So Iâ€™ll
keep you updated on that.

RALPH: Well, yeah, having Judge Grimm talk about it would be great. You know, Rule 502, the new
evidence code, has addressed some of these problems to a degree, and maybe taken some of the
pressure off us, but it is still, I think, one of the fundamental problems we have in
e-discovery, and that is doing an affordable privilege review to try and catch these things.
Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll have other shows just dealing with Rule 502. That is a big help.

Expediting Litigation by Strategic Cooperation



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/cooperation-lion.jpg?w=450
KARL: Okay. Rule 3.2, Expediting Litigation is another rule that youâ€™ve thrown into
the cocktail mix here. A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation
consistent with the interests of the client. How does that relate to eâ€‘discovery?

RALPH: Itâ€™s key. I mean, thatâ€™s the core ethics rule behind The Sedona
Conference Cooperation Proclamation , which if you havenâ€™t heard of it, go to
TheSedonaConference.org website, download and read it. Itâ€™s being signed on to by
judges everywhere. It is also â€“ speaking of Judge Grimm again â€“ the core
message in his case Mancia v. Mayflower Textile Services , which came out in October of 2008. <
See my prior blog on this important case. >

This is yet another key case to understand this whole business of keeping the cost of
eâ€‘discovery down, which is a core problem. Part of the reason eâ€‘discovery
costs get out of control is people lose track of this ethical duty we have to move things along.
That really is in the interest of your client. Letâ€™s stipulate to things.
Letâ€™s have more transparency and cooperation. Letâ€™s stop this old game of
hide the ball. Itâ€™s never been ethically allowed, but we all know itâ€™s gone on
for years and years.

Maybe in the paper world where people were competent, that wouldnâ€™t blow the
clientâ€™s budget out of the water. But nowadays, when you start playing hide the ball
and start playing games in e-discovery, and start trying to be obstructionist, when you start
filing boilerplate objections to everything and you donâ€™t cooperate, before you
know it, youâ€™re going to have the tail wagging the dog. Youâ€™re going to have
eâ€‘discovery be the most important part of your case. Itâ€™s going to cost you
hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars, just to get involved in sorting out the
eâ€‘discovery quagmire and the confusion in the disputes. Thatâ€™s not what
litigation is about.

Litigation is about the merits of the case. Discovery is just a way to get to the truth to then
argue about the merits. So my message, and the message of The Sedona Conference, is
letâ€™s cooperate on getting the information on the table. Letâ€™s stop trying to
play games andÂ one-upmanshipÂ and fighting over that. Letâ€™s then fight on
what the facts mean. Letâ€™s fight on what the law is. Thereâ€™s plenty of room for
arguments and disputes, but letâ€™s not fight over what should the format of production
be, metadata this, metadata that. I mean, most of these arguments that I see in cases are
totally unnecessary. You have just run up a bill needlessly on the clients. They think
youâ€™re being a vigorous advocate, but really youâ€™re not. Youâ€™ve lost
track of your duty to move things along, which is by the way, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure,
Rule Number One: quick, just, inexpensive adjudication. Thatâ€™s what we need to be
doing. Eâ€‘discovery has got to stop being the whipping boy against this and the way to do
it is by cooperating, which is why Iâ€™m such a strong believer in what Sedona is doing in
that area.

KARL: Yeah, we did a show with Richard Braman who heads The Sedona Conference on the
Cooperation Proclamation . Itâ€™s interesting stuff and certainly critical.

http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/yalta_summit_1945_with_churchill_roosevelt_stalin.jpg?w=450
RALPH: You know, I hear some people say, oh, well, thatâ€™s wimpy, But the truth of the
matter is, this is not just rolling over and giving what the other side wants. This is mutual
cooperation. This is what I callÂ  strategic cooperation to benefit your client. You have
got to pick your battles. One of your battles shouldnâ€™t be over eâ€‘discovery.
The battle should be on the merits of the case. The people that think this is just a mistake to
cooperate, theyâ€™re not really getting it. Theyâ€™re part of the problem,
they’re running up the cost of eâ€‘discovery. This is something that we all have to
kind of move beyond our old mindset. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with cooperating and in
fact, the ethics and the rules require it.

KARL: We did a really nice show with Ariana Tadler last week on the plaintiff perspective.
Sheâ€™s a prominent lawyer at Milberg and one of the few really well known
eâ€‘discovery experts on that side. She talked about the meet and confer, about how she
goes in with letters and what weâ€™re looking for and sort of an olive branch essentially
to try to get the case going the right way. But itâ€™s tempered with healthy skepticism at
the same time, you know, because it doesnâ€™t work all the time that way. And the cases
where it works are far better, she said, in terms â€“ for both sides.

RALPH: Well, I always say it takes two to tango and you know, if one side wonâ€™t
cooperate, that doesnâ€™t mean that you give and all they do is take. If they
donâ€™t give back and donâ€™t cooperate, youâ€™ve got one clear solution.
You go to the judge. You go to the judge quickly and right away. Thatâ€™s what all of the
judges say they want. So, you know, if you get one side that wonâ€™t cooperate with you,
you do your best, you make your paper record, you make it clear youâ€™re wearing the white
hat, and you take it to the judge. Youâ€™re going to find out those judges are going to
insist on cooperation. Thereâ€™s no tolerance in the federal bench for this at all.

Candor Towards the Tribunal



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/fingers-crossed.jpg?w=450
KARL: Thatâ€™s a good lead in to the next rule, candor toward the tribunal. Rule 3.3,
which says in various parts and subparts (a): A lawyer shall not knowingly (1) make a false
statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or
law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer . . . or (3) offer evidence that the lawyer
knows to be false . . . . So those are key to your position in this area. How does that impact
eâ€‘discovery, Ralph?

RALPH: Well, weâ€™ll come back to Qualcomm again because Qualcomm is bigger than
Zubalake at this point. < Thank God for that, as we are all so sick of Zubulake .> This is a lesson
case for the legal profession at large, that just happens to be in eâ€‘discovery and
itâ€™s ongoing. Although Qualcomm and BroadcomÂ settled their series of lawsuits
they had all over the country â€“ they finally settled that just a few weeks ago for a big
ticket being written from Qualcomm to Broadcom. But nevertheless, the lawsuit in San Diego
district court, even though itâ€™s over and the jury ruled against Qualcom over a year
ago now, it continues for the question of what kind of sanctions are appropriate against the
outside counsel who represented Qualcomm.

There will be a trial on this weâ€™re told later this year, probably near the end of 2009,
to assess the blame. Whoâ€™s to blame for the false statements being made to the judge, to
the jury, to the opposing counsel about the email of Qualcomm, about the denial that was made by
Qualcomm from the moment they filed suit, that they had any information concerning their
cooperation in this organization, technical organization concerning their patent. They
basically tried to hide the elephant. < Almost got away with it too. Makes you wonder how many
times they pulled this kind of “evil magic” in the past. > They responded to requests for
production on numerous occasions by saying “no, we donâ€™t have any responsive email
concerning this.” They had deposition testimony in advance of trial where everybody toed
the party line: “nope, we didnâ€™t do this, we didnâ€™t do that.” Then, it
turned out there was one honest witness at trial, into like the second week of trial, who said
“oh, yes, I think there was an email or two on that. I happen to remember a couple.”

Because of that one honest witness â€“ the jury by the way ruled against Qualcomm very
quickly after that â€“ Â because of that testimony, which was contrary to all the
representations that had been made by Qualcomm before and during the trial, the district
court judge said in effect “I want a hearing and I want to find out if there were intentional
misrepresentations made by lawyers to the court, made to the jury, made to opposing
counsel.” Thatâ€™s what triggered this investigation into the conduct where in the
judgeâ€™s words, the judge is convinced < among other things > that he was lied to at a side
bar conference during trial, … convinced that lawyers tried to hide evidence and were not
truthful.

So this is the core thing. The judges have to understand, and they have to be confident, that
when lawyers tell them things, itâ€™s the truth. If they canâ€™t trust the lawyers
to tell them the truth, who can they trust? That is the highest duty that we lawyers have, is to be
honest to the judges. When you donâ€™t do that, you know, you deserve the rebukes, you
deserve the sanctions, you deserve the ethical things. This is the core value – telling the
truth. Lawyers telling the truth to judges, lawyers telling the truth to each other and being
honest in their discovery. Thatâ€™s why this is a core message for litigation across the
board, that … our system of justice wonâ€™t work, if people are lying. Now, litigants
may lie, thereâ€™s perjury for that. Maybe, you know, that happens. < We all know it
happens all of the time. > But lawyers should never lie and thatâ€™s basically what this
rule is about, thatâ€™s what Qualcomm is about.

Fairness



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/3-manatees1.png?w=450 KARL:
Okay. Letâ€™s go into the final rule that weâ€™ll discuss on this, Rule 3.4, which
is fairness to opposing party and counsel. Weâ€™ve touched a little on this: A lawyer
shall not (a) unalwfully obstruct another partyâ€™s access to evidence or unlawfully
alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value. A
lawyer shall not counsel or assist another person to do any such act. Then in part (b): in
pretrial procedure make a frivolous discovery request or fail to make a reasonably diligent
effort to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party . . . . So how does
that play into this issue, Ralph?

RALPH: Well, weâ€™ve already kind of talked about it. This is the duty to cooperate; this
is the Mancia case and Judge Grimm; this is more of the ethical underpinning of why it is you need
to cooperate. Youâ€™re required by ethics, by being a lawyer, youâ€™re required
to cooperate on this level. Unfortunately, we still see happening, time and time again,
lawyers are not discharging their professional duties.

There is another case, not as well known, but I would point the listeners to. It demonstrates
non-cooperation, not following this. Itâ€™s called U&I Corporation v. Advanced
Medical Design , 2008 WL 821993. Again, this is one coming out of Florida, which is why I happen
to know about it, dated March 26, 2008. < It is an Akerman Senterfitt case where we obtained a
sanctions award against a very uncooperative plaintiff. > This is an important case because
it shows how a defendant can insist on cooperation from the plaintiff that was suing them here.
When they donâ€™t, you can get sanctions. …



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/kicking-screaming-police.jpg?w=450
Just one brief quote from the Magistrate Judge, Elizabeth Jenkins, who says, â€œ It is not
the courtâ€™s role, nor that of opposing counsel, to drag a party kicking and screaming
through the discovery process. â€� I think thatâ€™s an important quote. You know,
if you can show that to the judge, that thatâ€™s what you have had to do because
theyâ€™re not cooperating, theyâ€™re not being forthright, theyâ€™re
basically fighting you every inch of the way, you will get relief. If you apply to the court for
relief, cite to the U&I Corporation case, cite to Mancia , point out the duty to cooperate, and
you can stop this. Because unfortunately, you know, a lot of people donâ€™t â€“
didnâ€™t get the cooperation memo. In the real world, most people are still not
cooperating. So thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to know about these ethical
requirements, know about these cases where lawyers are having their hands slapped when they
donâ€™t fulfill their duties.

What’s It All About, Alfie?



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/alfie.jpg?w=240&h=206

KARL: How do these â€“ I mean, you know, there are these six rules and I really liked your
quadrant. Iâ€™m going to attach your blog, your description in a description of the
show, so that people can link to it. But, how do these rules sort of compete with each other. I
mean, who wins, the client or the professional duties?

RALPH: < Geesh, that’s bad choice; better elevate this to a big picture “ Alfie type ”
question. > They have to be brought into balance. Because a client doesnâ€™t really win
when a lawyer is fighting over everything with opposing counsel. Now, the client might at
first get a few rah, rahs out of that: “Oh boy, yeah, heâ€™s fighting for my side!” But
you know what? After he starts getting the bills for this month after month, year after year, it
stops being so exciting to the client. We all know that thatâ€™s not really in the
clientâ€™s best interest to be fighting over everything. < Only the lawyer wins then,
the client loses, whether they win the case or not .> That kind of vigorous advocacy is
something that even the biggest corporations canâ€™t afford. They need to cooperate.
Then the client will win.Â Thatâ€™s the point of all of this.

Weâ€™re here in the legal profession to represent parties that are in disputes, to give
them legal advice. So the winner on all of this has always got to be the client. They win when the
rules of ethics are followed. Thatâ€™s how they are designed â€“ the ethics duties
are designed to improve and maintain the quality of our system of justice.Â The system of
justice is not there for lawyers. Itâ€™s not there so weâ€™ll have a job.
Itâ€™s there so that justice will be done.

Thatâ€™s getting on the pulpit for a little bit, < well, o.k., maybe a lot > but the winner
should always be the people. < That includes companies too, a fact that some lawyers forget. >
That’s contrasted with the old days of, you know, trying to resolve disputes through
violence or self help. < My personal favorite is trial by drowning , kind of like
water-boarding, but you die. > Now we can turn to a system where the truth will come out and just
results will be attained. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re all here â€“ thatâ€™s
what weâ€™re really doing â€“ thatâ€™s what the goal of everyone is. <
Although, I swear it sometimes looks like a few lawyers are just in it for the money, but I could
be wrong .> So, I think the people, the clients, will be the winners, once we start following the
rules of ethics and have that end-game goal in mind.

KARL: That was as good an answer as I could have expected from that poorly framed question.
Iâ€™m almost thinking of my ethics class in law school and Judge Weddick here in
Pennsylvania is a well known state court judge here, teaches it. And, you know, he would take
one side or the other, and weâ€™d only attack one rule at a time. I threw six of them at you.
Almost impossible. But youâ€™re right, I mean, thereâ€™s â€“ this is a
balancing act, but really there are some solutions in here. Letâ€™s try to hit on a couple
of these solutions. Try to wrap this up in a couple of tips for the listeners.

Three-Fold Solution

RALPH: We might as well end on practical, positive stuff. < Assuming, of course, that I can
climb off of my high horse for a second! > Right now Iâ€™m talking about a three-fold
solution, trying to keep it simple. < Tomorrow, it may be a five-fold solution; whatever. > So,
number one is eâ€‘discovery teams. Thatâ€™s why I call my blog the
eâ€‘Discovery Team . The message there is that lawyers, techs, and management need to
all work together as a team. Thatâ€™s part of the way to overcome the competence problem
is get a tech – not tied to the hip as Craig Ball likes to say he wants to avoid – but get a tech on
your team. Learn to collaborate. Stop being the — you know < arrogant jerk >. Perry Mason, he
used a detective; todayâ€™s lawyer needs to have a tech. < Paul Drake with a pocket
protector? > They need to have a geek that they can work with. So thatâ€™s part of the
solution, form an interdisciplinary team. Thatâ€™s number one.

Number two is cooperation and be transparent in what youâ€™re doing. Cooperate with the
other side, fulfill your duty of disclosure, take that seriously; save the arguments for the
law. Weâ€™ve already talked about that. But that is the second core solution.



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/slide-rule.jpg?w=450

And then the third part we havenâ€™t talked about, but thatâ€™s what I call
calibration and metrics, which includes using the new technologies. Use the latest methods
in order to tackle the needle in the haystack search problem and to keep track of your
information and manage it better. This is the kind of thing that Jason R. Baron and the TREC
Legal Track addresses. < See eg. my prior blog on Jason Baron’s work , the webs for the
National Institute of Standards and Technology TREC Legal Track, the general TREC
conference. >Â Heâ€™s just come out with a new paper, Sedona has, on quality control
and metrics, which Iâ€™ll blog about soon. I think itâ€™s an excellent guide to
help people on this â€“ this use of calibration and numerics and metrics as part of
search.

A lot of groups are working on this. I was just presenting with George Socha of the EDRM.net
Group who now has an EDRM search guide available on their website, which provides more
information about calibration metrics, how to do so sampling and that type of thing. So
thereâ€™s a lot of ways to get information on this subject. I urge everyone to learn a
little bit more about how to do quality control, and how to do metrics, and to basically use
numbers as your friend to keep the price of eâ€‘discovery down. < Did I really just say
that? “Numbers as your friend.” Brother, even I think I’m a nerd. >

KARL: Yeah, weâ€™re doing a show coming up with another one of those people whoâ€™s
in that group. Herbert Roiblatt is going to be doing the show and Kershaw and Patrick Oot are
also talking about doing a show on this. So thereâ€™s no shortage of people that are
studying this that are willing to provide some information.

RALPH: Thank you for mentioning them. Thatâ€™s the other group, Anne Kershawâ€™s
group, Eâ€‘Discovery Institute .

So that to me is the core problem, and the solution to it is using statistics and sampling and
just getting a more disciplined handle on how much we actually review. In other words, how to
cull down things a lot. So thatâ€™s the third prong of the solution. Use teams,
cooperate, and figure out how to do search better by using some sort of metric analysis.

KARL: I donâ€™t get to say this very often, but thatâ€™s what brought me back into
the field is focusing in on that specific issue. Itâ€™s just â€“ if youâ€™ve
lived off of the other model, which is throwing lots of bodies at the problem, you realize just
how inefficient it is. And then when you study the studies, the Blair Maron case and anyone that
looked at that sort of brute force based on people, it doesnâ€™t work and itâ€™s
very, very expensive. You know, there are tools out there. Itâ€™s really fascinating,
and it ties right back into your first thread about people learning new skills and working
together as a team. Itâ€™s interesting how this all fits together.

RALPH: Well, thank you for having me on the show, and thank you to all the listeners < and readers
> for having the patience to hang in there. I know we went on and on, but itâ€™s important
stuff and Iâ€™m glad to have the opportunity to talk to you about it, Karl.

KARL: It is great. Thanks again, Ralph. For those who want to see a complete list of shows, go to
www.esibytes.com or â€“ and what we say here at the show is come to ESIBytes to learn more
about electronic discovery before ESI bites you back. Thanks again, Ralph.

Going “All Out” for Predictive Coding and Vendor Cost Savings

June 23, 2012





Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/kroll1.jpg?w=180&h=180 For
the last nine months I have been working on my firm’s litigation support outsourcing
project. As you may have heard , after a grueling Request For Proposal process , Â Jackson
Lewis selected Kroll Ontrack as our firm’s preferred provider of all non-legal,
e-discovery services. As a result, my dream of using predictive coding software and related
legal arguments in hundreds of my cases, and not just the biggest few, is about to come true. Not
only that, but it now makes economic sense for us to useÂ  Kroll SAS basedÂ software in
small cases too.

Under our outsourcing deal our client’s can now use Kroll Ontrack’s well-known computer
forensic services , andÂ their advanced software , at prices too low to mention. Suffice it
to say, Kroll Ontrack won the RFP on every level, both quality and price. Surprising, I know.
But that is one advantage of going all out , and being the first AmLaw 100 firm to do so.
WeÂ leveragedÂ the size of Jackson Lewis (over 700 attorneys), our high volume of cases
(over 2,500 new cases per year), and our growing reputation in the field of e-discovery, to
bring our clients Kroll Ontrack quality at discount prices.

My due diligence investigation led to the conclusion that Kroll Ontrack’s Â  Inview
Â softwareÂ has one of the industry’s strongestÂ  predictive coding
Â abilities. They call it Intelligent Review Technology . Also weighing in their favor
wasÂ  Kroll Ontrack’s Â willingness to customize their procedures and software code
somewhat to meet our specifications and practice standards. We can now use their predictive
coding enhanced software, Inview , not only in our biggest cases, but also in our medium size
cases.Â We may even be able to use it in some relatively small cases. We can also use their
Advanceview Â software for ECA, review, and small native productions in all size cases,
especially the small ones.



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/ferrari_2012.jpg?w=300&h=183 The
price savings we negotiated inures completely, 100%, to our clients. It is available to all of
them, if they use our services and if choose to use Kroll Ontrack . Of course, if in any
particular case we do not think Kroll Ontrack is the best vendor for our client in that case, for
any reason,Â we will recommend another vendor. Also, the client is always free to choose
the vendor it prefers. Our clients are always our primary concern and our sole duty. Still, in
most cases we expect it will be better for them to have us drive a Ferrari at Ford prices,
especially when the Ferrari runs on predictive coding type technology that allows us to get
the review done faster and cheaper.

In today’s fast-moving technology driven culture, there is a distinct advantage to being
first-in. Our new deal withÂ  Kroll Ontrack, the first of its kind, and the prices and
technology we have attained for our clients by this deal, is another example of this.Â  See
eg :Â  â€œThe Hacker Wayâ€� â€“ What e-Discovery Can Learn From
Facebookâ€™s Culture andÂ Management , Â andÂ  Impactful, Fast, Bold, Open,
Values: Guidance of the â€œHackerÂ Way.â€�

E-Discovery Services Are Not Legal Services



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/law-no1.png?w=192&h=209 The
outsourcing deal with Kroll Ontrack allows my firm to provide our client’s with access to
the latest Computer Assisted Technology and forensic services, and do so at a good price. But
there were many additional reasons for us to go all out with a professional vendor. In fact,
there are many good reasons for any law firm to phase out their e-discovery processing and
software hosting services. They are not legal services. So why are we selling them?

Vendors cannot provide legal services, neither can so-called technology consultants , even
if they are licensed attorneys. Â Only properly licensed lawyers practicing law can
provide legal services. Indeed, theÂ unauthorizedÂ practice of law is a crime in most
states, albeit usually just aÂ misdemeanor. So the services that e-discovery vendors
provide necessarily cannot be legal services. All of them will tell you that, but I suspect a
few of them cross the line when a practicing lawyer or judge is not looking.

The one special exception to this involves the use of outside contract lawyers for document
review. These are legal services, but they are rendered under the direct supervision of
counsel of record, not the vendor. This kind of legal outsourcing is governed by various state
rules of ethics and is not what I am referring to here. I am referring to the outsourcing of all of
the other non-legal e-discovery services that vendors provide, such as processing,
tiffing, software hosting, forensics and the like.

Recent case law on court cost awards is making this dividing line clearer. Standard
e-discovery vendor services have been examined in several cases and found to be
non-legalÂ services that come within the scope of court costs under 28 USC Â§1920.
See:Â  â€œWinning isnâ€™t everything, itâ€™s the only thingâ€�
â€“ Examining the new trend towards big e-discovery cost awards forÂ winners .Â 
For that reason, hundreds of thousands of dollars of vendor costs have been awarded to
prevailing parties as Â  costs, namely as exemplification and copying related services.
There is a split developing in the Circuits on the point of whether such services come within
the scope of 28 USC Â§1920. Compare: Race Tires America, Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp. ,
No. 11-2316, slip op. at *24, *30 (3d Cir. Mar. 16, 2012) withÂ  In re Online DVD Rental
Antitrust Litig. , 2012 WL 1414111 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 20, 2012) ($710,194.23 cost
award).Â But no case has held that the vendor’s e-discovery services are not taxable
because they are actually legal services.

Focusing On What Lawyers Do Best



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/focus.png?w=280&h=192 It just
did not make sense for our firm to continue to run a highly technical, non-legal business like
this as part of our law firm.Â By going all out , and relying instead on a vendor, Jackson
Lewis can nowÂ focus exclusively on what we do best, the practice of law. That includes our
core services of labor and employment law andÂ e-discovery law.

This move has also eliminated, for us, the many tricky issues facing all law firms who have a
litigation support department that charges clients for non-legal e-discovery services.
These are complex, highly technical, and expensive services. Many require a great deal of
training and education to do correctly. Anyone who thinks it is just a little more difficult
than making paper copies is out of touch. Some of these non-legal activities are just as
difficult as the practice of law. Some of the computer work involved is very difficult to do
correctly. It also requires a very substantial capital investment for equipment and
software to run these computer services. Efficient management of these enterprises is also
difficult. So is fair billing Â of these charges to clients.

For all of these reasons, even thoughÂ my firm is the first AmLaw 10 0 firm to outsource all of
its non-legal e-discovery business activities to a vendor, I expect many others firms will
soon follow. So does Kroll Ontrack . So did a whole lot of other vendors who participated in our
extensive RFP. They are gearing up now.

Outsourcing Non-Legal Services to e-Discovery Vendors Is Good For Clients and Good For Our
System of Justice



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/outsourcing.jpg?w=220&h=213
Outsourcing makes sense for the non-core functions that are beyond the mission and special
expertise of an organization. What could be more non-core for a law firm than non-legal
services? This is especially true for complex computer processing, computer forensics and
software services. Putting clients’ interests first requires this kind of team work.

Kroll OntrackÂ  responded favorably to my constant public harping in this blog and
elsewhere, for inexpensive, advanced software. The volume justified the deal, as did the
precedential value. We can now use Advanceview and Inview software in all size cases, not just
the biggest. I contend that the significant price move will allow Kroll Ontrack to make up in
volume what they have lost in margin. It was a smart business move and win-win for everyone. I
suggest that all other vendors be open to similar deals with their customers.

Our negotiations with Kroll Ontrack took nearly nine months, with my primary contact being
Chris Wall , an attorney and tech expert. I met with manyÂ  Kroll Ontrack executives to make
this deal, including their President and CEO, Dean Hager . I met with even more of their front
line professionals to set up a custom work flow, iron out details, and set up extensive
training.Â I cannot begin to name all of the people I have worked withÂ to make this
happen, but I did notice that one of Kroll Ontrack’s leaders, Joel Vogel , has a YouTube video
online. So I thought it would be fun to showcase him for specialÂ embarrassment. After all,
he did put up with several of my outbusts when I was fighting to get even more favorable terms for
our clients. JoelÂ is currently Sr. Vice President, Worldwide Legal Technologies , but
back in 2010 when this video was shot atÂ  Kroll Ontrack studios, he was known as the Chief
Service Evangelist .

I have no doubt that other law firms will soon follow our lead with Kroll Ontrack Â and other
vendors. It just makes sense for law firms to focus on the practice of law and leverage the
volume of their litigation for the benefit of all their clients.

It is true that some clients do not need this, the few sophisticated mega-corporations that
have already made vendor deals leveraging the volume of their e-discovery needs. But most
companies have not done so, at least not yet.

Some companies, since they are a business to begin with, and not a law firm, have set up and run
internal e-discovery business to serve their own needs. Some companies do this well, but many
do not, because again, like law firms, the e-discovery business is not their core competency.

Many of these companies are now realizing their limitations, and the complexity of running
e-discovery services, and are also turning to outsourcing. In fact, my due diligence of
outsourcing in general showed that in-house law departments are ahead of law firms, and many
have already turned to outsourcing. So although we are the first large law firm to outsource
all non-legal e-discovery, several corporations have already gone that route, but not many.
I predict that will change too, and change fast. Outsourcing non-legal e-discovery services
to professional vendors is inevitable for both law firms and corporations. The trend will
accelerate with the growing complexity of the technology and amount of data.

Electronic discovery vendors need to help themselves by making it easier for this shift to
happen. All full service e-discovery vendors should consider making similar deals with
other law firms and corporations for the general benefit of clients everywhere and our system
of justice. We need to be able to get to the relevant facts in large volumes of data quickly and
inexpensively.Â We need the new search and review technologies to be affordable for all
size cases.

No Slight Intended Against Other Vendors

Please do not construe my comments, nor my firm’s selection of Kroll Ontrack over others ,
Â as a slight against all of the other e-discovery vendors and software manufacturers. The
RFP had very stringent requirements, not just software excellence. We demanded not only the
best software, but also nationalÂ  one-stop-shopping for all non-legal e-discovery
services, not just search and review software. This included an area that is very important
for us, and our clients, namely forensic analysis and collection services. Very few national
vendors could provide all of the non-legal services we needed.

Further, although many software manufacturers now partner with full service vendors,
wherein their software is also bundled with other non-legal services, a few do not. One such
software vendor is Recommind who makes one of our favorite predictive coding products,Â 
Axcelerate . A few other software programs were eliminated for similar reasons.

So although I think Inview is a good product, and am especially impressed with the input that
information scientist David D. Lewis has had on the programing design, that does not mean that
I think all other competing programs are not good, or not at least as good.

I will say, however, without naming names, that not all software claiming to have predictive
coding capacities are created equal. In fact, I did not like some of them. But please remember,
as an avid software user and computer hobbyist since 1978, I have strong opinions about all
software , not just e-discovery software, and I can spot bs a mile away. Plus, as you may have
noticed, I tend to have strong opinions about things, when I have any opinion at all.

Predictive Coding Type Software Features Are Now Critical to the Practice of Law in the
Information Explosion Age

There are many fine software programs out there with predictive coding type features. These
advanced features, which I callÂ  artificialÂ intelligence type features, are now
critical to moving the law forward. The recent Rand Report agrees. Where The Money Goes :
Understanding Litigant Expenditures for Producing Electronic Discovery (2012); also see
my blog on this report.

Just as important are the legal methods now being developed to apply this new technology.
These days, that is what I spend most of my time working on. Here is one of the charts that I
created to summarize the new legal methods of review.



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/predictive-coding.png?w=450&h=290

Last week I spent three days in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, atÂ  Kroll Ontrack’s
Â headquarters teaching with several charts like this. With the help of several Kroll
Ontrack specialists, I taught forty of my liaisons how to useÂ  Inview Â and its
Intelligent Review Technologies (predictive coding). My training always includes
discussion of how predictive coding capacities fit into our firm’s core e-discovery legal
arguments of proportionality and cooperation.

I had previously had similar sessions with Kroll’s experts, including Joe White , and an
outside expert that we retained, Cliff Dutton . We have worked together for several months now
to develop very specific firm standards for search and review. In case you don’t know Cliff
Dutton , he is one of the original founders of EDRM whom we retained to provide us with
independent, non-legal, technical advice on outsourcing, costs, and e-discovery
standards. Cliff is the author ofÂ  eOPS 2010: Electronic Discovery Operational
Parameters Survey .

    One of the most exciting features of the new technology is that it allows for intelligent
    document ranking for the first time. This is a key feature of predictive coding that
    greatly facilitates proportional review.Â  See eg. a few of my recent articles on the
    topic of proportional review and on predictive coding:

    - Bottom Line Driven Proportional Review ;

As discussed at length in the above articles, predictive coding is far more accurate than the
alternatives of manual review or keyword search. It captures far more relevant documents, in
other words, has better recall, and does so with much greater precision. Better precision
means lawyers waste less time and money in final review of likely relevant documents before
production.Â This means significant costs savings in document review. The Rand
Corporation study understood this well.Â The conclusion of the report states at pages
97-99:

The most promising alternative available today for large-scale reviews is the use of
predictive coding and other computerized categorization strategies that can rank
electronic documents by the likelihood that they are relevant, responsive, or privileged.
Eyes-on review is still required but only for a much smaller set of documents determined to be
the most-likely candidates for production. Empirical research suggests that predictive
coding is at least as accurate as humans in traditional large-scale review. Moreover, there
is evidence that the number of hours of attorney time that would be required in a large-scale
review could be reduced by as much as three-fourths, depending on the nature of the documents
and other factors, which would make predictive coding one answer to the critical need of
significantly reducing review costs. â€Š

Conclusion

Better quality and lower costs. The long elusive promise of technology as applied to
e-discovery is finally coming true.Â That is why predictive coding is so important and why
every lawyer would be well advised to get on the bandwagon as soon as possible.

Clients are not stupid, especially sophisticated corporations with intelligent,
cost-conscious in-house counsel. Predictive coding technology, when used correctly,
saves money on review, perhaps as much as 75% according to the Rand Report. It also fits
hand-in-glove with proportionality arguments to counter would-be e-discovery
extortionists.

Yet, in spite of this, most litigation attorneys have, until very recently, been afraid to use
the new technology for the stated reason that it had never been approved by a court.Â When I
first heard of this popular excuse, I thought back to the good old days of the 1980s and a famous
trial lawyer I have always admired,Â  Brendan V. Sullivan . When representing Oliver North
who was testifying before Congress about his role in the Iran-Contra affair, Sullivan
responded to criticism from Senator InouyeÂ for his aggressive, bold objections with the
famous line:Â ” Well, sir, I’m not aÂ  potted plant . I’m here as the lawyer .”
That line was watched on tv by millions and was famous for years. All lawyers in the 80s admired
him for it, so did everyone else. We need more gutsy lawyers like that today in e-discovery, not
more e-discovery businessmen and techies.

The excuse of no-judicial approval for predictive coding is now gone. The main excuse still
remaining for lawyers to refrain from the adoption of predictive coding methods is the
perfectly valid and understandable one that they do not know how to do it. But that can be
rectified by time, training and effort. There are many vendors and consultants that can help.
I have been writing thousands of words to do my part to help the profession. More brass-tack
descriptions will be coming on this blog, plus just read the e-discovery newspapers on
popular cases.

We can do it.Â We are lawyers, not potted plants. Besides, we really have no choice if we want
to keep practicing law in theÂ Twenty-FirstÂ Century.Â All sophisticated
litigants will very soon rise up and demand that their lawyers use these new processes. Either
that, or they will get new lawyers. That is the way of the world.

E-Discovery Gamers: Join Me In Stopping Them

June 3, 2012





Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/greedy_man.jpeg?w=252&h=251
Many lawyers view litigation as just a game,Â  a game to be won at all costs.Â Electronic
discovery is just part of the game. The goal for such lawyers is not justice, and certainly not
truth. The goal is to win the game by any means possible. It’s about the personal profit and
power that comes from winning, either by final judgment or settlement.Â Law gamers
don’t care about justice. They are only in it for the money.

Truth Is Not Just A Construct

As a consequence, gamer lawyers do not see e-discovery as a way to get at the truth of a dispute.
They don’t care about the truth. Non-gamers ask for and look at documents to try to find out
what really happened. But not gamers. They view facts asÂ malleable. E-discovery for them
is just a way to find enough documents to construct a story. They only care about whether a story
will likely persuade a judge or jury to rule in their client’s favor. Not whether it is true.

Gamers view requests for discovery as potentially dangerous to their constructs. For that
reason, they will play endless, elaborate games to try to hide the facts. For them
hide-the-ball is just a game, one that might have economic consequences if they are caught,
but they rarely are. So the games go on.

E-Discovery Creates Leverage



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/greedy.jpg?w=297&h=244 Gamer
lawyers use discovery, especially e-discovery, as a way to impose an economic burden on the
other side, the person or person they are playing against. If they can make a document
production expensive enough, they can increase their leverage. They can drive up the
settlement value of a case. They can win and so make more money.

Conversely, if they dump a big enough pile of nearly irrelevant documents on the requesting
party, they can place a counter-burden. This burden of review creates an economic impact. It
may also be a good way to hide-the-ball. A smart move for a true gamer. Gamers lawyers play on
both sides, plaintiff and defense. Greed is an equal opportunity employer.

Gamers and Gamesmanship

Gamer lawyers tend to think that all lawyers are gamers like them, but just don’t play as
well. They assume that you have as little regard for the truth as they do. They assume that you,
like them, are just trying to win at all costs. They assume you are trying to hide the ball just as
much as they are. They assume your requests for production are asÂ exaggeratedÂ and
extortion oriented as theirs.

If someone, especially an opposing counsel, calls them on their gamesmanship, they think
that too if just another game tactic.Â They tend to view all lawyers who call them on their
gamesmanship as just Â irritated gamers or Â  spoiled sports. No doubt that is what they
are thinking about me right now.

When a gamer does sometimes realize that the other side is hamstrung by rules, and is not a gamer
like them, they tend to think that they are up against a naive patsy and play even harder.
Nothing gets them off their game.

They are delighted when their adversary is a moralist. They are more than happy to take
advantage of that. A true gamer does not care about rules of any kind. Rules are meant to be
broken, if you can gert away with it. Cheating is just another game tactic. Gamers only care
about winning. They find it hard to believe that everyone is not in it just for the money.

Do You Think Gamers Are A Minority?

Fortunately, in my experience, litigators with that kind of win-at-all-costsÂ 
mind-view are a small minority, but, nevertheless, they are often very successful. What do
you think? How common do you think this amoral attitude is among litigators? Compete the poll
below and share your thoughts. It is anonymous.

Take Our Poll

Are Gamers Unprofessional Money Grubbers?

I personally consider the mind-view or gestalt of gamer lawyers to an over-competitive
plebeian Â view of litigation. I consider them unprofessional and unethical because this
approach exalts winning and personal profit over the duty of a lawyer to serve as an officer of
the court. To me this service of justice is a near sacred duty. This is why I became a lawyer, not
to make money or amass power, and certainly not just to play games. But what do you think? Am I
just a naive idealist? AnÂ  irritated gamer?Â  Share your view with

Games, Gamers, and Game Theory

After all of this, it may surprise you to know that I myself am a gamer . I like games, especially
video games, and I even find game theory somewhat interesting.

I have been playing games all of my life, and computer games since Pong . The first computer
programs I ever wrote in the early 1980s were games, mostly for my kids. They still remember
myÂ  Mr. Computer Head , the world’s first make-a-face program, which I created on my
Texas Instrument 99/4A using TI basic, assembly language, and some macine code. It had color
graphics, music, some animation, and moving pixels (sprites). It even had one of the first
speech synthesizers. After you assembled a face, Mr. Computer Head would smile approvingly
and say: I sure look good now . It was fun creating and playing. I don’t have time to play much
these days, but I still keep up with the latest thing. Just last week I played the new Xbox
360Â KinectÂ  Star Wars Â game.Â Way cool.



Image: http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/kinectstarwars.jpg?w=450

Yes, I love games, butÂ only when there are rules. Without them it is just anarchy.
Moreover, as an adult I know that there is a time and a place for games and gamesmanship.
Litigation is not the time, not the place. Truth and justice are more important than winning.
Making a contribution to society is more important than making money.

I am also interested in game theory, although no expert on it. As Wikipedia explains , game
theory is the study of strategicÂ decision making. It focuses on the interplay of conflict
and cooperation and for this reason is a natural for legal analysis.

Grossman and Cormack on Game Theory, Ethics, and E-Discovery

The role of game theory in e-discovery was considered in an article by Maura Grossman and
Gordon Cormack,Â  Some Thoughts On Incentives, Rules, and Ethics Concerning the Use of
Â Search Technology in E-Discovery (Vol. 12, Sedona Conference Journal, 89-104) (2011)
(hereinafter “ Some Thoughts “). This article has been a sleeper, but well worth reading
for the game theory discussion alone, although this is Â just one part of their interesting
article on ethics and search.

The ethical issues involved in Some Thoughts are search specific and thus very timely to the
newsworthy cases of the day. It considers the ethics of a responding party who might wish to
game the system by deliberate use of ineffective search and review methods. It also considers
the ethics of a requesting partyÂ who might wish to game the system by deliberate use of
overly broad requests for production, either to hide the true nature of the information being
sought, or to ensure that the pertinent data are produced, even if the responding party is less
than diligent in its search efforts . Some Thoughts at pg. 95.

The bottom line for me on game theory and e-discovery is that it shows that any purely rational
Â  approach to discovery, one that disregards ethics and good faith, is doomed to failure.
It is a game that cannot be won. I base this conclusion on what is called in game theory as the
Prisoner’s Dilemma . Here is how Grossman and Cormack explain it:

The â€œlitigatorâ€™s dilemmaâ€� referenced in the second quotation above
refers to the well-known characterization of discovery as an example of the hypothetical
scenario from game theory, the â€œprisonerâ€™s dilemma,â€� in which there
is mutual advantage to both parties in pursuing common interests so long as both act
cooperatively and in good faith, but tremendous disadvantage to the party that acts
cooperatively and in good faith, if the other does not.14 There is a lesser disadvantage
â€“ but a disadvantage nonetheless â€“ if both parties act uncooperatively and in
bad faith. According to game theory, the â€œrational choiceâ€� in this situation
is for each party to act uncooperatively and in bad faith, incurring the lesser disadvantage,
so as to avoid the risk of the more severe disadvantage. Although the end result is
disadvantageous to both (relative to acting cooperatively and in good faith), the
disadvantage is less than would be incurred by one party behaving well, when the other party
behaves poorly. Uncertainty, fear, and distrust tend to preclude the mutually advantageous
outcome. …

Whether or not e-discovery truly is a prisonerâ€™s dilemma, the belief that it is
mayÂ be self-fulfilling â€“ with the effect of incentivizing counsel for either
party to engage in badÂ behavior, in the belief that it is the rational choice under the
circumstances.

Some Thoughts at 96-97. Here is how my favorite cartoonist Scott Adams’ explains it:



Image:
http://ralphlosey.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/prisonsers_dillema_dilbert.gif?w=450&h=165

Grossman and Cormack end theirÂ  Some Thoughts Â article with the following
conclusion:

Whether in the capacity of counsel for the responding party, counsel for the requesting
party, or as an officer of the court, a lawyer has many incentives to conduct an efficient and
effective search. Incentives to conduct an ineffective or inefficient search arise largely
from attempts to game the system, fear that an adversary will game the system, insufficient
knowledge of the efficacy and cost of available search methods, and financial profit from the
use (or failure to use) particular search methods. By and large, these incentives tend to be
neutralized by the existing rules and ethical proscriptions when counsel are knowledgeable
and competent with respect to search methods in e-discovery and strategies for their optimal
use. The net effect is that the approach most beneficial to the client, and to the justice
system, as well as least likely to violate the rules or ethical proscriptions, is to make an
informed choice of the most effective, most efficient search method. Lawyers should not
assume or insist that existing practices â€“ such as exhaustive manual review â€“
are always the best choice in the face of growing evidence that other methods can achieve as
good, if not better results, at a fraction of the cost.

Conclusion

Litigation is not a game. It is an important governmental process central to our democratic
system. Law is not a mere business. It is an important profession, a calling. Truth and
justice, law and ethics, are core cultural values.

Lawyers who ignore these values and employ game tactics are doomed to fail. If their
opposition is also a gamer, then both will both lie and cheat each other. The clients on both
sides will lose. If their opposition is not a gamer, they will also lose as soon as the judge who
controls the proceeding catches on to their gamesmanship. Once they are exposed, they are
done. You can easily stop unethical gamers by exposing them.

Message to lawyer gamers: quit the game. Play video games instead. If you just went into law to
make money. Get out. Go into business. They have different ethics, different rules. You can
win there. Maybe. But you cannot win here. The profession, especially the judges, will make
sure of that. So will thousands of lawyers like me. We care about the law, even if you don’t.

    Sedona Principles, 2nd Ed.

    1. Electronically stored information is potentially discoverable under Fed. R. Civ. P.
    34 or its state equivalents. Organizations must properly preserve electronically
    stored information that can reasonably be anticipated to be relevant to litigation.

    2. When balancing the cost, burden, and need for electronically stored information,
    courts and parties should apply the proportionality standard embodied in Fed. R. Civ. P.
    26(b)(2)(C) and its state equivalents, which require consideration of the
    technological feasibility and realistic costs of preserving, retrieving, reviewing,
    and producing electronically stored information, as well as the nature of the
    litigation and the amount in controversy.

    3. Parties should confer early in discovery regarding the preservation and production
    of electronically stored information when these matters are at issue in the litigation
    and seek to agree on the scope of each partyâ€™s rights and responsibilities.

    4. Discovery requests for electronically stored information should be as clear as
    possible, while responses and objections to discovery should disclose the scope and
    limits of the production.

    5. The obligation to preserve electronically stored information requires reasonable
    and good faith efforts to retain information that may be relevant to pending or
    threatened litigation. However, it is unreasonable to expect parties to take every
    conceivable step to preserve all potentially relevant electronically stored
    information.

    6. Responding parties are best situated to evaluate the procedures, methodologies, and
    technologies appropriate for preserving and producing their own electronically
    stored information.

    7. The requesting party has the burden on a motion to compel to show that the responding
    partyâ€™s steps to preserve and produce relevant electronically stored
    information were inadequate.

    8. The primary source of electronically stored information for production should be
    active data and information. Resort to disaster recovery backup tapes and other sources
    of electronically stored information that are not reasonably accessible requires the
    requesting party to demonstrate need and relevance that outweigh the costs and burdens
    of retrieving and processing the electronically stored information from such sources,
    including the disruption of business and information management activities.

    9. Absent a showing of special need and relevance, a responding party should not be
    required to preserve, review, or produce deleted, shadowed, fragmented, or residual
    electronically stored information.

    10. A responding party should follow reasonable procedures to protect privileges and
    objections in connection with the production of electronically stored information.

    11. A responding party may satisfy its good faith obligation to preserve and produce
    relevant electronically stored information by using electronic tools and processes,
    such as data sampling, searching, or the use of selection criteria, to identify data
    reasonably likely to contain relevant information.

    12. Absent party agreement or court order specifying the form or forms of production,
    production should be made in the form or forms in which the information is ordinarily
    maintained or in a reasonably usable form, taking into account the need to produce
    reasonably accessible metadata that will enable the receiving party to have the same
    ability to access, search, and display the information as the producing party where
    appropriate or necessary in light of the nature of the information and the needs of the
    case.

    13. Absent a specific objection, party agreement or court order, the reasonable costs of
    retrieving and reviewing electronically stored information should be borne by the
    responding party, unless the information sought is not reasonably available to the
    responding party in the ordinary course of business. If the information sought is not
    reasonably available to the responding party in the ordinary course of business, then,
    absent special circumstances, the costs of retrieving and reviewing such electronic
    information may be shared by or shifted to the requesting party.

    14. Sanctions, including spoliation ï¬�ndings, should be considered by the court
    only if it finds that there was a clear duty to preserve, a culpable failure to preserve and
    produce relevant electronically stored information, and a reasonable probability
    that the loss of the evidence has materially prejudiced the adverse party.
