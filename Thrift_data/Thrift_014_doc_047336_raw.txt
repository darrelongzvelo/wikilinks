Extraordinary Journeys with a world-class traveler





Dresden is music

September 1st, 2012

I arrived in Dresden by train on a grey afternoon in the middle of a very hot month of August. From
the taxi window on the way to the hotel, all I could see – at a distance – were the striking
silhouettes of an old church, few grand domes, spires and stately buildings. To my surprise,
they looked dirty, as if covered by soot. I was expecting more from the famous Saxon capital.

The next disappointment was the hotel: my room was right across the railroad that had just
brought me from Berlin – noisy. When I asked about air conditioning, the portly concierge
lady told me there was none, and by her voice it was clear she wasn’t pleased with the
question. There were no hangers in the closet, either. When I opened the window, a very fast
train was crossing like a bullet in front of me. Definitely not my day.

After spending most of the night awake, the next morning IÂ  noticed that everything in the
hotel was old, from the carpet to everything else, as if frozen in the 50′s or 60′s styles.
The people were old too, mostly East German couples staring at me with curiosity when I entered
the breakfast room. Having been locked behind the Iron curtain for over 40 years, they also
looked strange to me in their old-fashioned outfits and hairdos. Looking for orange juice and
finding none, I asked for a newspaper – in English, as I don’t speak German. Bad idea: the
whole room stopped eating to look at me disapprovingly. It must be the war, I imagined. They
probably cling to their memories, and English must be the last language they want to hear.

On each corner of Dresden, young musicians show their art

 

I was determined to see Dresden no matter what, but asking the concierge how to get a taxi to the
historic district didn’t seem to be the right thing, either: ‘ Why a taxi? Take the tram,
it’s cheaper’. What a strange place!

So I took the tram, actually very clean and efficient – and cheap, as I didn’t pay for it. I
was waiting for someone to pay the ride to, but no one came. Before stepping down, I saw a paying
machine by the exit door, but it returned the change I put in. Asking for instructions didn’t
help, either, as no one spoke English. I felt guilty, but the tram was already moving and I had to
get out.

NowÂ  in the town’s center, I could confirm that the buildings were indeed dark, but also
also majestic, in an elaborate rococo style, bold and imposing. Walking through narrow
streets and passages, I discovered surprising charming areas that seemed to have been
scrubbed clean, plenty of boutiques, elegant hotels – and tourists. Lots and lots of them,
everywhere.

In Dresden, the quality of street music is very high.

 

But what really caught my attention was the music coming from under medieval arcades, where
groups of young musicians sang and played instruments for the tourists. Street musicians are
not unusual in Europe, but the quality of the sounds produced by the young performers was
exceptional, the kind of talent we pay hefty prices to see in New York’s Carnegie Hall or the
Metropolitan Opera.Â  It was hard to resist the allure of the perfectly-tuned voices and
melodies, and for a long time I went from one group of musicians to another, leaving change in
each one of their hats. They sure deserved it.

 

Had I known more about Dresden’s history, the quality of its music wouldn’t have
surprised me. Reading a tourist guide while savoring an excellent cup of coffee in a plaza
surrounded by stately 18th-Century buildings, I learned that as far back as the 15th Century
Dresden was already a city of arts with a strong tradition of court music and choirs. Later,
Weber, Schumann, Wagner and many other heavyweights musicians of their time – of all times
– spent most of their creative years in the city; Richard Strauss even premiered nine of his
operas in its imposing Samper Opera House.

Some of Dresden’s old buildings are still covered by the soot left by the raids of WW II

Culture was a priority for one of Dresden’s most celebrated rulers, August the Strong,
whose gigantic statue now faces the opera house. With his son Augustus III, he transformed the
city in the most celebrated center of artistic activity in the 18th Century Germany, when it
was known as ‘the Florence of the north”. This outstanding legacy survives today in its
many orchestras, choirs and music schools.

 

But not all has been music in the city’s history. Dresden was also the stage for one of WW II
most controversial episodes, the seemingly indiscriminate destruction of the city by
Allied bombers in February of 1945, two days and nights during which most of the its center was
turned into a landfill, and 25,000 thousands were killed by air raids. I was captured by one
survivor’s description of it:

Image:
http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Dresden-after-the-air-raids-of-1945-300x225.jpg

In one of the most controversial episodes of WW II, Dresden was destroyed by Allied forces in
1945. It is not possible to describe! Explosion after explosion. It was beyond belief, wor se
than the blackest nightmare. So many people were horribly burnt and injured. It became more
and more difficult to breathe. It was dark and all of us tried to leave this cellar with
inconceivable panic. Dead and dying people were trampled upon, luggage was left or snatched
up out of our hands by rescuers. The basket with our twins covered with wet cloths was snatched
up out of my mother’s hands and we were pushed upstairs by the people behind us. We saw the
burning street, the falling ruins and the terrible firestorm. My mother covered us with wet
blankets and coats she found in a water tub.We saw terrible things: cremated adults shrunk to
the size of small children, pieces of arms and legs, dead people, whole families burnt to
death, burning people ran to and fro, burnt coaches filled with civilian refugees, dead
rescuers and soldiers, many were calling and looking for their children and families, and
fire everywhere, everywhere fire, and all the time the hot wind of the firestorm threw people
back into the burning houses they were trying to escape from.I cannot forget these terrible
details. I can never forget them. â€� â€”Lothar Metzger, survivor. [67

The reasons for the raids were never very clear. Dresden didn’t have any military
importance for the Nazis to justify such an attack, it’s said that president Roosevelt
himself was against it. Nevertheless, the cultural landmark of Germany, the Florence of the
north, was reduced to dust in two days in 1945, and its reconstruction is still taking place
today. Its mainÂ  cathedral, Frauenkirche, one of Dresden most beloved symbols, has
literally risen from the ashes after collapsing two days after the bombings – a spitting
image of the original, in 2005 its altar was reassembled from nearly 2,000 fragments by a
grass-roots movement dedicated to rebuild the capital of Saxony to its original splendor.

I remembered once hearing the German mother of a friend of mine saying ‘we washed by hand each
of those stones’. And I thought she was exaggerating…

Berlin is blooming

August 26th, 2012

My first trip to Germany.

The initial impression of the land of my ancestors I had while still on the plane from
Amsterdam, where my New York flight arrived early in the morning. Few minutes into the short
flight to Berlin, already above German territory, I was captivated by the exact lines
dividing the cultivated fields below, as if someone from above had drawn them with a ruler! For
as long as the eye could reach, every single inch of land was planted in exact squares. Here and
there, farm houses reminded that people lived there, and small forests separating
properties completed a gorgeous carpet of men-made precision in all shades of green and
yellow. Every once in a while, massive groups of giant white fans reached for the sky –
power-generating wind mills, something we don’t see in the US.Â  “This is a different
world”, I thought. So removed from everything I knew, yet so strangely familiar!

Brandenburger Gate



 

My immigrant elders on my mother’s side must have been very brave – or very desperate – to
venture out of this land of straight lines onto wild South America, at a time when traveling was
so difficult, knowing so little about the life that awaited them. I wished I knew more about
them, I thought while looking attentively a the changing landscape below. All I remember was
my grandmother telling that her father emigrated for being ‘tired of sending sons to
wars’. Was he referring to the Prussian conflict? Now flying over the land they left a
century or so ago, I felt sorry I didn’t ask her more questions. Did her parents find the peace
they were looking for? And could this trip of mine actually be a way of connecting with that
distant link?

 

Then Berlin.

Berlin is a punch in the stomach. In the course of my first day there I went from dazzled to
puzzled, from intrigued to awed, even perplexed. It takes time to process Berlin, it awakens
all sorts of emotions – even pity.

Yes, pity. As we all know, the German capital was heavily bombed at the end of WW II, when air
raids killed thousands of people and left hundreds of thousands injured and homeless. By the
end of the war, the city was a pile of rubble – magnificent churches, opera houses, museums,
theaters, schools, hospitals, homes, everything was bombed to bits. The reasons for the
tragedy are also well known,Â  but it’s hard not to be touched by the scope of the
destruction when looking at war photographs now in museums. Wars are stupidÂ  whatever
their reasons, but when they target some of the world’s dearest cultural riches, they
become pure insanity.

 

Image:
http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Berlins-wealth-visible-everywhere-300x225.jpg

The wealth of Germany, visible everywhere

 

Germany of course lost the war, and Berlin was divided. As the West’s stage against
communism, West Berlin received massive injections of American capital and started to
rebuild soon after, while the East had to pay 10 billion Deutsche marks to the Soviets as ‘war
reparation’. Then in 1961 the Berlin Wall came up almost overnight, and for decades the Cold
War divided not only the city but the world. Finally, em 1989, German reunification. I
remember as if today – I came out of my kitchen in New York to watch news programs showing
people on top of the Wall and huge numbers of East Berliners crossing to the West. History was
being made as I cooked dinner that night. Now that anyone can walk from East to West Berlin
crossing the Brandenburger Gate, it may seem like not a big deal. But few yards away, white
crosses remind us of the many East Berliners who lost their lives trying to escape the
so-called ‘Democratic East Germany’. Berlin is living history everywhere.

The Wall is mostly gone but for one or two parts still left up for tourists; East and West Berlin
are now one single city. To my surprise, I found East Berlin more charming and friendly,
perhaps because it was spared the sterile American architecture of the 60′s and 70′s, of
which West Berlin’s Postdamer Platz is the worst case – as soulless as a Midwestern
shopping mall. “Money was scarce in East Germany”, explained a local.Â  “There
wasn’t any to build anything”.

 

But unified Berlin is rich beyond anything I had seen, and signs of that wealth are everywhere
– expensive brand-new cars on the streets, good-looking and well-dressed people,
magnificent boulevards, high-price restaurants. In one of them, the traditional Lutter &
Wegner, a staple of East Berlin during the Cold War, I saw something quite interesting: three
different refrigerators, one for French wines, one for German Riesling and one just for –
cigars! I never even imagined that each type of wine requires different fridges, but the
Italian waiter tried to correct my ignorance explaining that this care is absolutely crucial
to preserve the taste of their wines. Oh well, if he says so….

And Berlin rebuilds with a vengeance, saving what was left of the city and adding to it an
elegant modern architecture with advanced energy-saving technologies. The buildings
being erected everywhere have a style of their own, pureÂ  Berliner, one that I hadn’t
seen anywhere else – glass and sunlight seem to be a big part of it. Like in the Reichstag Dome,
the old seat of the German parliament – set on fire, bombed, left to crumble, it now stands
proud again, a testament to all the dramatic events that took place there. Empty lots still
remind us that something – who knows what – once stood there. But at the pace things are
happening, in few years these spaces will be occupied again; cranes work full time and don’t
stop until it gets dark. The city is looking beautiful, like a teenager girl who becomes a
gorgeous woman. Embracing the River Spree, its many parks – yes, parks are everywhere, and
people on bikes and young couples with children – give this old city the feel of new.
Everywhere, art galleries remind us that Berlin is again about art. And fun – it boasts the
greatest night life in Europe, hands down.

Berlin mixes old and new architecture with energy-savings technologies

 

Five days are not enough in Berlin, there’s so much to see: castles, museums, shows,
exhibitions, sports events, or just watch a never-ending parade of European leaders come ask
chancellor Angela Merkel for money! Quite entertaining.

I wished I could stay longer, but Dresden waited. Leaving Berlin from the modern Hauptbahnhof
Â  station on one of Germany’s fast trains, I felt almost sad saying goodbye. I should
return in few years, hopefully, when all the work going on will be done. I am sure BerlinÂ 
will be one of the most beautiful cities in the world by then.

Paris will have a run for its money…

Belize, a gentle and warm country

April 30th, 2008

We know we are in the tropics as soon as theÂ flight attendants open the door of the
airplane,Â in Belize City. The air is suddenly hot and humid, the sunÂ and the colors
intense andÂ bright; quiteÂ aÂ dramatic change from the cold weather of New York we
had leftÂ in the morning.

And the contrasts don’t stop there.Â At the airport, people look warm and friendly
-Â they actually smile and make eye contact when they speak inÂ gentle voices!Â The
pace is definitely slower,Â  peopleÂ seem to move to a different rhythm here.Â We
would have toÂ slow down to adapt, I thought then.

We still had to flyÂ south toÂ Cotton TreeÂ Lodge, in the Toledo district, and
waiting for us on the airport runaway was aÂ small planeÂ lookingÂ beaten, not
inspiring much confidence.Â To disguise my nervousness, IÂ  joked with other
passengers on the boarding line:Â ”Will this fly”?Â  Yes it will, theyÂ assured
me.Â The airline – Mayan Air – isÂ well known and reliable, they
promised.Â ”Let’s hope they are right”.



Image: http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/belize-41.jpg

From the plane windows IÂ Â watched the landscape below change from a lush vivid green
around small villages to the bright blue of the ocean, shining under theÂ sun. Further on
weÂ movedÂ overÂ meandering rivers andÂ farmlands, untilÂ that
sceneÂ changed to aÂ massive tropical jungle, dark and green, compact and
mysterious.Â By the time weÂ arrived in Punta Gorda,Â  Belize’s southernmost
town and our final destination, we had flown aÂ long time over theÂ rain forest.

But we hadÂ notÂ arrived yet.Â Â At the “airport” in Punta Gorda,
Â aÂ small one room cabin withÂ a smiling MayanÂ at theÂ one desk, we met our
driver Scott, a friendly lookingÂ AustralianÂ man in his 20′s. He wouldÂ take us
– finally – to Cotton Tree Lodge, in aÂ funny looking old bus painted withÂ the
wildest colors and the Lodge logo.Â We had been flyingÂ for many hours -Â from New
York to Miami, from there to Belize City, then on to Punta Gorda -Â  and we were exhausted.

The road to the Lodge was aÂ narrow and difficultÂ dirt path.Â Scott stopped to give a
ride to two Mayan looking menÂ walking, theyÂ  were all smiles as they came in greeting
us,Â  happy to get a break from the intense heat.Â ”They are very poor around here”,
explained Scott after they got out,closer to their village,Â  Sant Anna. “We try to help
them as much as we can, asÂ theyÂ are nice people, and they don’t have cars or bikes. My
daughter Laura and I looked at each other in disbelief.Â What a difference a day makes, I
said. We have so much in the US, and here people live with so little…

As I was dwelling in the inequalities inÂ life, weÂ got to the Lodge. I felt so tired
allÂ I can remember isÂ  aÂ nice breeze suddenly blowing on our
faces,Â enormousÂ trees with trunks the size of houses, and the noise of birds and a
river on the background.Â Gloria, another smiling Belizean,Â greeted us at the front
desk as if we were old friends.Â SheÂ gave us the keys to our cabana,Â a beautiful
rustic but comfortable construction standing on wood poles and surrounded by aÂ veranda
with two hammocks. TheÂ place felt like heaven under the shady trees by the river.Â I
unloaded and crashed inÂ one of the hammocks.

“Tomorrow we’ll start exploring”, I thought, closing my eyes toÂ enjoy the breeze.
“Tonight all I need is a shower and some food”.

But Laura was already in her bathing suit, heading towards the river.

Just back from paradise – Belize

April 29th, 2008

 



Image: http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/belize-39.jpg

I’ve justÂ returnedÂ from a week in Belize with myÂ 15 year old daughter Laura, who
hadÂ time offÂ school forÂ Spring Break. And coming back from that tropical
paradise to a cold and rainy New York was quite a shock…

I would probably never have gone to Belize if it wasn’t for Laura. My younger daughter
isÂ one of those so called ‘green’ people,Â concerned about the environment, the
indigenous populations, saving energy, the forests, the seas, the world – youÂ get the
picture. I do believe she will end up working in one of these fieldsÂ in the
future,Â andÂ started toÂ lookÂ for a place where she couldÂ explore her
talents. I needed time off from my busy life in New York as well;Â little did I know that I was
about to have such an eye-opening adventure.

I hadÂ heard smart people taking about Belize before. Some scuba divers I know commented on
itsÂ coral reefs beingÂ perfect for theÂ  sport, and they travel there often.
Magazines I likeÂ have been publishingÂ articles on that small – but apparently very
interesting -Â Central American country,Â and I had a feelingÂ something was going
on in Belize…

Curious,Â I logged inÂ The New York Times online, always a good start. In itsÂ Travel
section, my favorite, IÂ foundÂ a number ofÂ articles on many Belizean subjects:
itsÂ preserved rain forest,Â MayanÂ population, Mayan ruins, snorkeling and
scuba diving outfitters (a whole bunch)Â and positive reader’s comments about
aÂ place called The Cotton Tree Lodge, in Southern Belize’s Toledo District. I just had
to check it out.

I did look at theirÂ website www.cottontreelodge.com a nd I am glad I did – I was about to
discover one real gem, a place so different from anything I hadÂ seenÂ before that it
took me few days there to start understanding what a great idea itsÂ American founders –
Chris Crowell and Jeff Pzena – had when they built it. Yes, the Cotton Tree Lodge – and
Belize, for that matter – is one of those places we need to adjust to, before we start
understanding it.

But once we do,Â we’ll be hooked forever.

A fine portrait

April 6th, 2008

There are few things as rewarding as looking at theÂ faces of our children. Seeing their
faces on a portrait painted by a fine artist is an even more specialÂ experience, one of pure
joy.Â Â Â 

This is whatÂ I experiencedÂ when The Connecticut Society of Portrait Artists –
CSOPA -Â and the Greenwich Arts Council selected my daughter’s Chiara portrait, by
Candance Taubner, to be part of theirÂ exhibition Faces of Winter 2008 – Fine Art
Portrait Festival .Â  Selected by an independent jury from hundred of entries,Â these
57 portraits represented some of the mostÂ talented artistsÂ from Connecticut and New
York.Â The show as a whole displayedÂ - once again – theÂ high standards of theÂ 
CSOPA and the Greenwich Arts Council.Â 



Image: http://goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/chiara.jpg

Chiara’s portrait painter, Candance Taubner (photo), is known for an outstanding ability
toÂ reveal the essence of her subjects in her portraits. She says ‘the face is a universe
unto itself – ever changing, surprising, mysterious and compelling. I seek to discover and
reveal the essence of my subjects, no matter what age they are. It never fails that I find unique
beauty in each person, and I delight in revealing it to them and to the world’.

Her portrait of my daughterÂ isÂ aÂ proof that she achieved her goal, once more.Â

Rio and beauty

January 25th, 2008



Image:
http://www.goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/jesus-rio-de-janeiro.jpg

Rio’s beauty dazzles visitors much before they land at Galeao airport. Even from the air,
this Brazilian city of 8 million people looks spectacular: the blue waters of the Atlantic
shining under the intense tropical sun, the white sands of its coastline against the lush
green mountains, and – on top the the highest peak – a colossal statue of Christ, the
Corcovado, blessing the city with open arms. The word dramatic doesn’t begin to describe
this view.

No city I know matches the scale and the exuberance of Rio’s landscape, or displays such a
colorful, musical and electric culture. Its natives, the cariocas , are warm, laidback,
lively and fun. Rio is the city of samba , and its contagious beat is everywhere. On top of that,
Rio’s Carnaval – the four days of hedonistic revelry right before Lent – is a feast to the
eyes and Brazil’s biggest party.



Image:
http://www.goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/watergirl.jpg

Rio is not only blessed by its geography; its people are also drop-dead gorgeous. The city
worships beauty in all its shapes and forms, and the sexiness of their women is well known. It
was probably made famous by the song ‘The Girl from Ipanema’ , a bossa nova tune talking
about a regular girl walking to the beach. ‘Tall and tanned and lovely’ , as the song goes,
she was far from an isolated case : some of the best looking creatures anywhere are seen on
Rio’s beaches everyday, showing off perfect and barely covered bodies. It was in Rio that
the tanga - a tiny biquini that leaves very little to the imagination – was first spotted.

This general genetic good fortune might be attributed to Brazil’s notorious mix of races,
but cariocas also put a lot of effort into health and beauty. At day break, the sidewalks of
Ipanema and Copacabana beaches start getting crowded with joggers and walkers of all ages, a
morning routine that’s part of life in Rio. And they not only take good care of themselves –
they also love to talk about it. As soon as I arrive in Rio I hear about the latest workout fads or
nutrition programs ‘guaranteed’ to prolong youth. Every friend seems to have a special
vitamin mix, a cream to keep wrinkles off their tanned faces, a formula to make their skin shine
or the hair grow stronger. Judging from their looks, these efforts are perfectly rewarded:
it’s not uncommon for women over 50 to look like mid -’30s elsewhere. So much so that a
friend of mine jokes that “Rio doesn’t know what a 50 year old woman looks like”.

While the aesthetic standards are very high , they are quite different from the ones in the
Northern Hemisphere: round shapes and feminine curves are a must, ‘noticeable’ butts
considered a blessing. Being skinny is associated with illness, not with elegance.
Brazilians definitely have their own beauty guideliness, and they are proud of it. Not
surprisingly, plastic surgery flourishes – Rio has some of the world’s best surgeons,
and are they busy! More surgeries of this kind are performed there than anywhere else in the
world.

With all this attention to beauty, one may be inclined to think that Rio is a superficial and
frivolous society. Not at all. Life is not easy for a big part of the population; people work
hard for their money, poverty is a reality in many areas, and crime a real problem in this
metropolis of huge gaps between the haves and have-nots.

Yet, even the poorest of the poor is high on life and exudes a contagious joie de vivre. People
with modest incomes save the whole year to buy a costly costume and be part of the Carnaval
parade . Visit a favela , as the slums are called, and you will see broad smiles on every face,
happy kids playing soccer on the streets, and crowded parties where on the weekends the samba
beat goes on until the morning.

Rio, in spite of its problems, is a happy place; it lives by its own standards and moves to its own
rhythm. One has to be able to step ‘out of the box’, so to speak, to understand the different
set of values they seem to live by.

I think we can only attempt to do that by being there and getting immersed in their fun-loving
culture. And once we understand it, we will love Rio forever.

Tango in Buenos Aires

January 18th, 2008



Image:
http://www.goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/tangodance.jpg

Buenos Aires is one of my favorite cities in the world. And not only because it is
cosmopolitanÂ  with loads of charm and world-class hotels, restaurants and shopping, but
also because the Argentine capital is where South American culture meets its European roots.
The result is a vibrant and sophisticated city like no other.

Buenos Aires offers the advantages of international centers like London, New York or Paris
– for a fraction of the cost. The exchange rate is 3 pesos for 1 dollar; and to give an idea,
dinner in a top restaurant with great Malbec wines costs less than $10 per person. Let it also be
said that the elegance and good looks of the Portenos , as the natives of Buenos Aires are
called, add a lot to this city’s allure.

Not surprisingly, our Tango in Buenos Aires tour, last November, was great. We arrived in the
Southern Hemisphere at the end of their Spring, but the hot Summer days Buenos Aires is famous
for had not yet started. Coming from a cold end of Fall in New York, this sudden change of weather
was most welcome – coats were off right on arrival at Ezeiza Airport.



Image:
http://www.goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/caesar-park-hotel.jpg

We were lucky with our hotel: five star Caesar Park Hotel was elegant and calm, yet in the center
of Recoleta , one of the most prestigious neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. Surrounded by grand
French-style mansions, embassies and upscale boutiques, we were right across the street
from Patio Bullrich , an international shopping center offering from Chanel and Yves
Saint-Laurent to the famous Argentine leather and wools.

But the main attraction of our tour was tango, and the high point of our days were dance classes
in the San Telmo studio of Maria Edith. A warm and friendly tango dancer of international
acclaim, she and her dedicated team of instructors introduced us to the magic world of this
dance that – in its theatrical movements and dramatic sounds -embodies their culture.
Maria Edith taught us not only steps, but also that for us women dancing tango means allowing
our bodies to be led by a male partner, following his moves and control. A fascinating cultural
experience, to say the least.

People in Buenos Aires love to have fun and seem to live by night; no self respecting citizen
goes out to dinner before 9 pm and the streets are crowded until late hours. We soon adjusted,
and each night took us to a different great restaurant: for the famous Argentine beef we chose
El Mirasol , in the La Recova area; meat never tasted that good. For a special treat with local
flavor, we drove far away to La Boca , a working class neighborhood where tango was born and
still rules, to a restaurant that is also a ‘shrine’ to soccer team Boca Juniors , the
leading team in this city where soccer is almost a religion.

Oh, and the tango shows! Fantastic! Totally off-the-beaten-path and hard to find, was a
presentation of Fernandez Fierro , a tango orchestra that is starting to attract attention
the way Ã�stor Piazzolla did, before achieving international fame. The audience at this
funky and far away place was mostly young people and Europeans, who always seem to know where
the special attractions are. We did, too, and this show was one of the best we saw.

We had an excellent driver in Matias, a P orteno who knew his city well and made sure we were
always safe. With him in tow we visited sophisticated Puerto Madero , hip Palermo Viejo , busy
Calle Florida , the museums Evita and Malba , and many other sites in that culture-loving city.
On our last day we were able to attend the opening match of the Argentine Open Polo
Championships , the major polo tournament in the world; the Argentines are the undisputed
leaders in the so called ‘sport of kings’. This event attracts a very international
crowd, and nowhere else it is played quite like there – as Matias told us, explaining its
rules. Nothing like a driver who knows his polo.

Only in Buenos Aires.

Charming Marais II

January 14th, 2008

I enjoy Paris more when I rent an apartment than when I stay in hotels. And not only because I save
money, but because I am able to do the very things that make Paris special – buying food at
local shops, cooking new recipes, savoring a warm baguette for breakfast with the smell of
fresh coffee coming from the kitchen. Real life things.

I guess I’m not alone, judging from the many rental agencies now specialized in short term
leases for tourists. I’ve tried many, good and bad ones. I once got such a poorly equiped
apartment I had to buy bed linens and a coffee maker. But after trial and error I came to like one
agency called Allorenta . They not only have a good inventory of properties for any budget, in
any part of town, they are also very correct.

Renting an apartment also allows me to explore the city the way I like – in a relaxed pace,
walking, really getting to know a neighborhood. Paris must be seen by foot, and nowhere this is
more true than in the Marais.

The Marais is perfect for walking. One of the oldest parts of the city, it is famous for narrow
pedestrian-only streets with small specialty stores, good restaurants, trendy boutiques
and inviting cafes ideal for short stops in the middle of the day. It is also the gay district of
Paris – art galleries and shops offer the latest in clothes, shoes, home decoration and
everything else in between. Even food looks better on their windows.

Some of those places are so ahead of their time that they merit a visit. Like L’Eclaireur , for
instance, an impressive avant-garde style store-cum-gallery that no self respecting trend
setter or fashion editor could ignore. Places like this abound in the Marais, and make sure
Paris will remain the fashion capital of the world, hands down.

Last December, while in the Marais for the holidays, my favorite walking route started with
leaving ‘my’ apartment on rue des Tournelles – just around the corner from excellent
Brasserie Bofinger – and walking towards rue du Pas de la Mule. On the way I’d pass a small
restaurant always full with locals, Bistrot de L’Oulette . Then I’d turn left at the
corner and go to Cafe Hugo, a small place right on Place des Vosges. Named after French writer
Victor Hugo , who used to live next door in what is now a museum with his name, the Hugo has good
food and great views of the Place. It’s sidewalk tables are crowded even in the winter,
thanks to movable heaters placed around an area covered in transparent plastic. I would just
get a table and have a capuccino, watching world pass by – people watching is one of the
greatest things to do in Paris.

After the Hugo I would visit the antique shops and art galleries under the arches of Place des
Vosges, where all styles – from very contemporary to more traditional works – are
represented. Moving on to rue des Francs Bourgeois , leaving Place des Vosges behind, I would
pass rue de Turenne, where I just can’t haelp doing some window shopping at the many
boutiques. This is an area crowded with sophisticated locals and well heeled tourists, all
sporting the latest fashion styles as well as the newest iPhones and Blackberrys models. Lots
of Americans there in December, by the way. So many, no one would say our dollar was $1.44
against the Euro, the weakest it’s been in a long time. God bless.

In spite of our ailing currency, I still love some to do a little shopping in the Marais: for
white shirts I go to Anne Fontaine or Rayure ; for the latest in fun designer clothes at
reasonable prices there is La Piscine, on 13 rue des Francs-Bourgeois, where I always find
something funky, yet elegant. Last time I bough such a good dress there, my 20 year old daughter
just had to have it for herself.

I like to stay on rue des Francs Bourgeois passing rue Sevigne, then turn left on rue Pavee
towards rue des Rosier , the heart of Jewish Marais. This is where the best delis and boulangers
-bakeries – in Paris are located. If you like falafel, look no further. If you are a shoe
lover, like me, there is Miguel Lobato , on 6 Rue Malher, right beyond rue des Rosiers. Many
elegant women I know shop there for their great selection of fine shoes.

I find rue des Rosiers one of the most charming in the city, and like to spend time there when I am
in Paris. Mid-way through it there is a deli called Chez Marianne , a perfect spot for a
mid-afternoon break. From there I walk on to rue du Vieille du Temple, home to many gay bars and
boutiques. After browsing their interesting store windows, I turn left at rue du Roi de
Sicile. Sometimes I go to a creperie called Page 35 , at 4, rue du Parc Royal. It is a small place a
bit removed from this crowded center, but their crepes are great and the service very
pleasant.

There is much more to the Marais than restaurants and boutiques: there is the Carnavalet
Museum, about the history of Paris, a great Picasso Museum that covers the whole extent of his
works and many cultural activities any time of the year. One needs time to see the whole Marais.

As I never have that much, I usually return to New York before getting to the end of my “to
see” list.

Next time, hopefully.

Paris, August 31st, 1997

January 13th, 2008



Image:
http://www.goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/lady_diana.jpg

I had actually been briefly to the Marais once, before the memorable lunch at Lâ€™
Ambroisie I described before. I was there to have dinner with my family and a Colombian baby
sitter we had then, Tatiana.

We had just arrived in Paris after a two week vacation in the South of France, where we had rented
a house in Mougins, near Cannes. At he hotel we were staying for one night someone mentioned a
restaurant called Ma Bourgogne , on Place des Vosges, and we decided to have dinner there. The
next morning we would be flying back to New York.

I remember the date very well: August 31st, 1997. Dinner was nice, the place very interesting,
but by 10 pm the kids were tired, and we headed back to our hotel. We will never forget that night:
it was the night Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris. And we had passed on the same tunnel
the accident took place, only half an hour before.

We learned about it the next morning, checking out of the hotel. Tatiana had been out and came
back almost in tears: “Princess Diana died not far from here last night”, she said. I
remember the silence that fell upon all of us in the hotel lobby. No one could say a word.

That strange silence stayed with us on the way to the airport. Paris was quiet that morning,
there was a weird stillness in the air, even the driver said nothing. My then ten year old
daughter commented on how quiet things were and on Princess Diana’s death. I replied with
something like “she was a beautiful person and she died in the most beautiful city”. But no
one really talked much.

We got to a Charles de Gaulle airport heavy with security guards, at the same moment Prince
Charles ‘ Royal Air Force jet was landing. He had come to Paris to claim Diana’s body.
Unreal.

A long time after that date, I learned that the young French woman who, with her doctor
boyfriend, got to Diana’s car crash site before anybody else, was the daughter of someone I
knew well. The girl herself had been my guest in New York, years before. Small world we live
inâ€Š

I still remember well the days that followed, the amazing display of emotions worldwide, the
feeling that Diana left too early. Some people capture our imagination more than others, I
guess. She had something different, something hard to describe – she was real.

I never met her, but each time I return to the Marais and beautiful Place des Vosges, I remember
Diana. And I feel that we all lost something, that night in Paris.

Charming Marais I

January 12th, 2008

I first fell in love with the Marais district of Paris in 1998.

I was coming to Paris via Geneva, Switzerland, where I had left my 11 year old daughter in a
summer camp at a school called Le Rosey . It was the first time she was going to be away from home,
and I was a bit anxious about it. Friends had assured me that the school was a great place for
girls to learn French fast. I knew it had a good reputation, but still… It’s a long way from
home in New York, I was thinking all along.

Knowing how I was feeling, my friend Sherry decided to come along to help. Our plan was to come
back to New York via Paris, after spending few days in the French capital. I would make sure my
daughter was fine in Geneva, before returning to the US. It was also a good excuse to see Paris
again, of course.

The night before we left Geneva, Brazil lost the world soccer championship to France. I was
born in Brazil, and soccer is a serious business for us. Needless to say, I was not in a good mood
leaving Geneva.

We got to Paris in the midst of huge commemorations. Our taxi driver decided to bypass Avenue
des Champs ElysÃ©es , which – he said – was chockfull of people going crazy about
France’s victory over Brazil. He then left us at our Ritz Hotel, but even that normally quiet
heaven was in a festive mood – I had never seen so many French flags on Place VendÃŽme .



Image:
http://www.goldenbeetours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ambroisie.jpg

It was at the Ritz that we first heard of a restaurant called Lâ€™Ambroisie , one of the
â€˜tres grandes tablesâ€™Â  of Paris, assured us the concierge. They were fully
booked for dinner that night; would the ladies be interested in lunch the next day? Yes, we
were. “Anything”…

I felt better the next morning; a night at the Ritz can cure me of any woes. The always perfect
doorman put us both on a taxi and told the driver: â€œPlace des Vosgesâ€�. I
remembered from French classes that Place des Vosges had been the residence of French writer
Victor Hugo, of Les Miserables fame, but I was not familiar with it. We were in for quite an
experience…

One enters Place des Vosges through vaulted arches that separate it from the rest of the Marais
area. It is the oldest square in Paris, a perfectly symmetric square surrounded by houses with
the exact same facade. The feeling is of being back to the Middle Ages – finished in 1612 to
commemorate the wedding of King Louis XII with Anne of Austria, the square and the houses
around it were built with red bricks and strips of yellow stone resting over square pillars.
For centuries these were the homes of the French aristocracy. Easy to see why.

Our lunch at Lâ€™Ambroisie didnâ€™t disappoint, either. Starting with the
building itself, a hotel particulier facing the square – antique tapestries on the walls,
chairs covered in velvet, wood floors – everything reminded of old world elegance and of a
different, more refined era. The food was extraordinary; each new serving opened the way to
new tastes and nuances never experienced. The plates were so beautifully presented, that at a
table next to ours few Japanese gentlemen â€“ all dressed in identical blue suits
â€“Â were filming it all. As soon as the waiter placed the food in front of them, each
man would get a camera, point it to his plate, and start recording. We were so amused by the scene
we could not help watching. Even the cooks came out of the kitchen to look.

After dessert, a waiter brought us a tray of cigars to choose from. Visibly confused as to whom
to offer them first, as cigars are always offered to men, he clearly felt better when Sherry
told him â€œwe donâ€™t smoke cigars, thank you. Our husbands do, but they could not
be with us todayâ€�. We all laughed at the sign of relief on his face.

This was a long, delicious and memorable lunch, one never to be forgotten. Leaving that temple
of great food and getting back to the ‘real’ world, we took time to walk around the Marais.
Charmed by its beautiful architecture, we were at the same time surprised at how lively,
modern and hip the area was. It is full of art galleries, bistros, brasseries, special
boutiques and people from all over the world. We just loved it, and vowed to go back some day.

It wouldnâ€™t be this time I would see the Marais again. Back at the hotel, there was a
message for me: my daughter was not happy in the summer camp, and needed to see me. Immediate
change of plans: I would be on the next train back to Geneva. As for Sherry, she decided to go to
London visit her Wellesley friends who live there, before returning to New York.

Never a dull moment, I thought to myself, as my train slowly left Parisâ€Š
