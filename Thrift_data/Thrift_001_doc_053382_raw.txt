There is Only One Gear

There is only one gear …

I was catching up with a friend the other day post 9-5 at Rock Bottom Brewery in Chicago —
(let’s be real, it’s more like 8-6) — and weÂ talked about the usual bar topics:
careers, the future,Â philosophy,Â food and life. In that order.

In the midst of that convo, he brought up a concern about potentially becoming a work-a-holic
and how it sometimes causes us to put other social endeavors on the back burner. We noticed
thatÂ oftenÂ times when you look to the top of corporations, organizations and the
like, a great deal of those folks are workaholics. There may be other slightly
moreÂ intrinsically intelligentÂ people working below them in the hierarchy but,

“hard work beats talent, when talent doesn’t work hard”

Similarly, when you look at Olympic athletes, the talent gap is minimal between most. The
Gold, Silver and Bronze goes to the guy or girl that a) wants it the most and b) put in the most prep
time.Â It makes sense.

But who wants to get wrapped up in an arms race of hours on the job?Â We’re social
creatures. Many of us thrive and gain fulfillment Â from relationships, altruism and more
“noble” ambitions than increasing corporate margins.

We often see work and social life as a trade off called work-life balance. To win at either, the
scale has to tip to one side or the other.

But my buddy made a good point — while that’s the blueprint right now for most, there’s
likely another, better one, that’s not widely applied. It’s up to our generation to
define what that archetype looks like.

Here’s my interpretation of his wisdom:

Why not give 100% to everything? Why not burn the candle at both ends?

Does that sound irrational or unreasonable? Of course.

To that I say this:

â€œThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world:Â the unreasonable one persists in
trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable
man.â€� – George Bernard Shaw

In reality, that might mean finding more efficient, effective, calculated ways of using
every minute you’re awake.

Hey, don’t give me that look. I never said it would be easy.

I think though, that to get all the places we want to go in this day and age, there is only the one
gear — FULL SPEED AHEAD .

Thanks for reading.

The End Game

June 25, 2012 Brent T Leave a comment



Everything has an ending and a beginning.

Image:
http://bgtrotter.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/michael_jordan.jpg?w=300&h=216

Michael Jordan after winning his first NBA Championship In 1991

Often times, the biggest challenge is getting started. People have written many books about
the subject–from Guy Kawasaki’s,Â  “The Art of the Start” Â to Eric Ries,Â 
“The Lean Start Up” Â (which just got added to my “to-read” list).

I’m sure these titles are packed with valid, tested and valuable insights, but we may not
really need them to get the motor running.

The bulk of the challenge is mostly in our heads.Â Before we even get started on a project or
set out to accomplish a goal, all the challenges, obstacles, time and sacrifice that are going
to stand in the way of our success make their way to the forefront of our minds. Sometimes it can
cripple your motivation and negatively effect your optimistic outlook. The road often seems
much longer than you first anticipated.

But I think there’s a better way to think about things; a better way to look towards the
future.

I call it “The End Game”. Rather than starting at the beginning, imagine how you might feel
once you’ve reached the top of the mountain–for lack of a better metaphor.

What does it feel like when you’ve finished that 5K or marathon? The rush of euphoria. The
sense ofÂ accomplishment. Knowing that all that training has paid off.

What does it feel like when your inbox is empty or that paper is finished and submitted; when
there’s nothing standing between you and the fresh air outside or the latest episode of
Breaking Bad (for you couch potatoes)?

One my favorite business leaders,Â  Gary Vaynerchuck Â once said inÂ  an inspiring
rhetoric in the sky ,

“the fear of losing often trumps the excitement of victory for so many people” .

In that same vein, the hardship of getting started up a steep hill often trumps the feeling of
reaching its peak, standing tall and saying to yourself, “I made it”.

I’d challenge you not only to begin with the end in mind, (to quote Steven Covey), but to
imagine indulging in the taste of victory before having experienced it; smell the aroma of
success before the pot has even started to boil.

At the very least, I think it’ll make you hungry.

The Best Part About Buying A Lotto Ticket

March 30, 2012 Brent T 2 comments

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner

So by now we all know the odds of winning the lotto are well, bad.

    In a less numerical context and more grounded one, it’d be like the odds of all these
    things happening in the same year all rolled up into one.

    - Â The St. Louis Rams and The Charlotte Bobcats winning their respective
    Championships

    

    - Ron Paul getting the Republican nomination

    

    - Gas prices dropping to $2.00/gallon nationwide

    

    - Apple going out of business…tomorrow.

    



Sounds about right.

Considering the likelihood, it’s not really something we should get all anxious about.

However, it is something worth getting dreamy about–thinking of all the things you would do
with the money should you get lucky enough.

Traveling the world, wiping out all your student loans, getting the capital for that start-up
you’ve been twiddling your thumbs about and even buying that 4.5MM yacht…That’s the
best part for me.

But when you really start getting aspirational about it, there’s this tinge of excitement,
and this imaginary dude that taps you on the shoulder to say, “hey man, what’re you waiting
for”?

Brian Tracy , one of those people who’s names you always see on the tail end of
“inspirational” quotes but have no idea why or how they’re famous once said,

“All successful people men and women are big dreamers. They imagine what their future could
be, ideal in every respect, and then they work every day toward their distant vision, that goal
or purpose”.

And even though you might not believe him because Wikipedia calls him a “self-help author
and motivational speaker” by trade, he’s right.

The first step in being the man is believing it. It’s a little backwards, I know, but that’s
what imagination is all about. We’re seldom prepared for the things we’re capable
of–but already believing you’ll be ready when the time comes is a good way to stay
prepared.

Happy Friday all. I’m gonna go daydream now.

Thanks for reading.

Don’t Mind the Weather

http://bgtrotter.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/as-the-light-breaks-through-christina-from-chicago.jpg?w=300&h=199

as the light breaks through... by Christina from Chicago

At U of I, I was an assistant Course Developer / Teaching Assistant for a course titled,
Creativity, Innovation & Vision taught by one of Illinois’ most admirable professors,
Bruce Litchfield .

The course description reads:

Personal creativity enhancement via exploration of the nature of creativity, how
creativity works, and how to envision what others may not. Practice of techniques and
processes to enhance personal and group creativity and to nurture a creative lifestyle.

It seems lofty, and even vague, but the course is mostly rooted in study of problem solving.

The advice that stuck with me most was the notion of looking at problems as opportunities.
I’ve heard that same sentiment echoed or exemplified from the likes of Peter Drucker to
Roger Martin to David Heinemeier Hansson to Michael Jordan . You may or may not recognize the
names, but you should check out their stories/work if you haven’t.

Now I don’t know if it’s the 75 and Sunny forecast in Chicago that’s got me all excited
about what the future holds today, but I thought I’d share my excitement with you (in a long
over due blog post).

Maybe I’m just being optimistic, as I always will be, but I’d strongly advise taking a look
at everything around you through the lens of opportunism today and see what the world looks
like. Remember, nothing is ever as bad or as good as it could be.

Now take my vague, provocative advice and run with it.

Thanks for reading.

Prosperity: What’s it to You?

February 20, 2012 Brent T 2 comments



Image: http://bgtrotter.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/yacht.jpg?w=300&h=187

I Want

A few days ago, my lady friend and I were heading to a friendâ€™s apartment for his
birthday. We’re old folks (23) so we were complaining about being tired and zapped of energy
at 6 p.m., and so we cranked up the radio to find some energy.

Flipping through the stations, we didn’t find much. Suddenly,Â  Fragma’s, “I Need a
Miracle” Â comes on and she goes, “Ooo I really like this”. I raise my eyebrow like
I’m Rocky Maivia .

“Never heard it before, babe”.

We talk and she goes on to say that she, like many people, enjoys when artists she likes are
relatively out of the limelight. For some, it allows for a more special connection with the
music. For others, I’m sure they just like being esoteric. I can relate to an extent. But
there’s a certain part of me that loves the idea of artists I like becoming “mainstream”
(provided they don’t conform to the pressures of the radio and let it compromise their
vision) because their messages get more exposure…I digress.

Looking at it from another angle, I do understand that thereâ€™s a certain sense of
credibility that comes from having perceived foresight of success; an eye for talent, if you
will. Being the Talent Manager that noticed Justin Bieber or the scout or analyst that saw the
Jeremy Lin phenomenon coming suggests some skill or knowledge on the part of the
â€œprophetâ€�. However, thatâ€™s under the assumption that
â€œbecoming mainstreamâ€� as an artist is how we define success.

Which brings me to my point: Success can and should have a different meaning for everyone.

As Iâ€™ve said countless time before, Iâ€™m a fan of Chipotle and the Dollar Menu.
Iâ€™m happy with that. But Iâ€™m also going to own a yacht. (Hence, the yacht
photo). Beyond material things, I want to be an inspiration to people and help redesign our
nauseating, broken, education systemâ€”just to name a few.

Defining success at the start puts you in a different class. Youâ€™re competing with a
smaller, more distinct host of peopleâ€”and that for you may make personal success more
attainable. You get to really zero in on how to get from point A to point B, and really envision
it.

Now this isnâ€™t to suggest that you should diminish your vision, either. Itâ€™s
quite the opposite. Â Iâ€™m suggesting you strive for more than traditional
success; a 4-bedroom beach house, a couple 2012 BMWâ€™s, and a nice corporate job with a
6-figure salary. We can have all that and more but we can do better, too.

Iâ€™ll leave it up to you to decide what â€œbetter than thatâ€� is.

Thanks for reading.

This is a Draft

February 12, 2012 Brent T 2 comments





Image: http://bgtrotter.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/first-draft.jpg?w=300&h=201 I
didnâ€™t plan on making my first post of the New Year about this topic. After over a
monthâ€™s in a blogging hiatus, I wanted this first post to be really â€œhard
hittingâ€�, ya know. (I really donâ€™t even know what that means). I guess
Iâ€™ll save that for the next one. This was actually inspired by a few text messages with
my friend Jordan yesterday, who I donâ€™t have nearly enough conversations with
anymore. Many epiphanies have come of convoâ€™s with her. But this one was surprisingly
relevant to some things Iâ€™ve been thinking about lately. Check it out:

Jordan : Hey you. What are you up to tonight?

Me : No plans yet. Meeting a few friends after work for drinks then who knows. U?

Jordan : I never make plans. No freaking idea. I wanna do something though.

Me : You sure donâ€™tâ€Šlol

Jordan : Haha I hate plans. Well, I hate making them. I like when theyâ€™re made for me.

Me : Iâ€™m a good planner but when you over plan, you might as well not have made plans in the
first place. The plan of plans is to reduce uncertainty and anxiety about whatâ€™s going
to happen. Over planning creates the same problem.

Jordan : True. Lol. Well if you could just plan what Iâ€™m doing tonight, thatâ€™d
be awesome.

Me : Thanks Jordanâ€Šgonna write a blog post today about planning.

Image: http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g
Well, likely tmrw.

And here we are.

We can spend so much time planning everything to the tee that we forget about just going with the
flow.

I especially notice it when writing. Think of the last time you had writers block. You
donâ€™t know what you want to say or how to say it or how much to say, so you stress out. A
whirlwind of thoughts (or sometimes emptiness) clogging your mind while your stare at a blank
page and a blinking cursor. Why not just get something, anything down and see where it leads
you?

Itâ€™s an even issue when it comes to planning our lives. Donâ€™t plan at all, and
you end up somewhere you donâ€™t want to be with no way out. Get too committed to a rigorous
plan and you risk the same fate.

Thatâ€™s not to say Iâ€™m not an advocate of outlines, RSVPâ€™s and having
â€œa planâ€�. You better believe I edit, proofread and re-read my work a bagillion
times. And itâ€™s definitely no fun being uncertain of what you want to do with your life.
Iâ€™ve spent much of the last month trying to really figure out what I want to do.

But when we try to draft everything up to the very last detail, thereâ€™s this tension and
anxiety that comes with making sure everything goes exactly according to our plans. Well, as
Ernest Hemmingway said, â€œthe first draft anything is shitâ€�. Thereâ€™s
this need to want to know exactly what the road ahead looks like for us. Itâ€™s
counterintuitive though, because everything these days is so dynamic and innovative;
itâ€™s hard to map out a real plan in advance. I think itâ€™s not so much the plan you
choose to take, but the plan you choose to make.

Sometimes the spontaneity of life can really make it luminous, ya know?

My advice is to get comfortable with uncertainty. Make amends with the first draft output not
being perfect. Try to learn how to live within a â€œworking planâ€�. Donâ€™t
worry so much about your first draft being your final one.

If you work on it, things will work themselves out.

Thanks for reading.

How Not to Suck at Ice Skating

December 22, 2011 Brent T 2 comments





Image:
http://bgtrotter.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/how-not-to-suck-at-ice-skating.jpg?w=300&h=199
I’m terrible at ice skating. I know that now for sure. I kind of assumed I would be because
I’m also pretty atrocious at roller-skating. But now I’m absolutely certain of it.

How do I know? My team and I went Ice Skating in Grant Park last week. They’re great when it
comes to social events–no surprise they were on AdAge’s, Best Places to Work . After 4
attempts to get the right skate size and twenty or so minutes of tightening and re-tightening
the laces, I finally got out on the ice.

There were some pretty good skaters out there. Some of my teammates seemed liked they’d been
skating forever and some were merely beginners. The advice they gave me was pretty solid.
“Just glide”. “Trust your skates”. “Don’t lift your legs so much”. I followed
it accordingly, taking careful baby steps.

I felt I was making a decent amount of progress. I had yet to fall after about an hour inching my
way around the rink when theÂ Zamboni guy sat us down to re-pave the ice. Little did I know
that’sÂ precisely what I was doing wrong.

When the ice had settled and the surfaced smoothed, I was ready for round 2.

As we got back on, we saw two little girls take to the ice with their mother–they couldn’t
have been any older than 5-years old. They followed a pretty distinct pattern as I observed
them. They would grab their moms hand, get pulled along for a bit, let go of her and then crash.
Over and over again. Each time though, the time between letting go and falling down got a little
bit longer. Soon they were waving off their moms assistance and actually enjoying Â the
falling down part. They were attempting spins, 1-footers and I think I saw one of the girls try a
triple axel (total exaggeration). All to no avail, but they were progressing.

They were fearless .

By the end of the day, they looked and probably felt more comfortable out on the ice myself. Yet I
still hadn’t fallen. That’s where I went wrong.

The fear of failure can and will stunt your growth. In order to grow, we have to seek out things
that challenge us. We have to find opportunities to fail–often. A lot of times, people who
care about us want to shield us from failure, pain or strife. But it’s okay. What doesn’t
kill you can only make you stronger, right ?

On the scale of “Worst Skater of All-Time” to “ Apolo Anton Ohno “, I finished
somewhere around “pretty awful skater” on my first time out. But I figured out (rather
remembered) the secret to success in skating and pretty much anything.

Fail early and often–and try not to take it so seriously.

Thanks for reading.
