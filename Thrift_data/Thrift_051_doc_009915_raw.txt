 Hokusai started the series "100 Poems Explained by the Nurse" (Hyakunin isshu uba ga etoki)
in 1835 and made 28 colour woodblocks and 62 drawings and drafts with the intention of helping
kids understand easily "100 Poems by 100 Poets" as if a nurse narrated the story to them.

The Great Wave off Kanagawa - Wikipedia

The Great Wave off Kanagawa ( ç¥žå¥ˆå·�æ²–æµªè£� , Kanagawa Oki Nami
Ura ? , lit. "Under a Wave off Kanagawa") is a famous woodblock print by the Japanese artist
Hokusai . It was published in 1832 ( Edo Period ) as the first in Hokusai's series 36 Views of
Mount Fuji and is his most famous work. It depicts an enormous wave threatening boats near the
Japanese prefecture of Kanagawa . As in all the other prints in the series, Mount Fuji can be
seen in the background. While sometimes assumed to be a tsunami , the wave is more likely to be a
large okinami . (Japanese " ocean wave ".) Like the other prints in the series, it depicts the
area around Mount Fuji under particular conditions.

Copies of the print are in many Western collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York City , the British Museum in London , and in Claude Monet 's house in Giverny , France .

Copies and derivative works



Like other well known Japanese prints, the Great Wave has been frequently copied using the
same techniques, as well as reproduced by photo-mechanical means. These copies are often
confused with the authentic original print.

The print is one of the most reproduced artworks in the world, and was one of the subjects of the
BBC documentary series, " The Private Life of a Masterpiece ", which detailed the fascination
surrounding the work in the East and West, its influence, and the artist's insights into a
number of different areas, as revealed through the piece.

Hokusai Katsushika Wiki



Katsushika Hokusai ( è‘›é£ŸåŒ—æ–Ž ? , October or November
1760â€“May 10, 1849) [ 1 ] was a Japanese artist , ukiyo-e painter and printmaker of the
Edo period . In his time, he was Japan's leading expert on Chinese painting . [ 2 ] Born in Edo (now
Tokyo ), Hokusai is best-known as author of the woodblock print series Thirty-six Views of
Mount Fuji ( å¯Œå¶œäž‰å��å…­æ™¯ , Fugaku SanjÅ«roku-kei ? , c.
1831) which includes the iconic and internationally recognized print, The Great Wave off
Kanagawa , created during the 1820s.

Hokusai created the "Thirty-Six Views" both as a response to a domestic travel boom and as part
of a personal obsession with Mount Fuji . [ 3 ] It was this series, specifically The Great Wave
print and Fuji in Clear Weather , that secured Hokusaiâ€™s fame both within Japan and
overseas. As historian Richard Lane concludes, "Indeed, if there is one work that made
Hokusai's name, both in Japan and abroad, it must be this monumental print-series...". [ 4 ]
While Hokusai's work prior to this series is certainly important, it was not until this series
that he gained broad recognition and left a lasting impact on the art world. It was also The
Great Wave print that initially received, and continues to receive, acclaim and popularity
in the Western world.

Early life and artistic training



Hokusai was born on the 23rd day of 9th month of the 10th year of the HÅ�reki period (October
or November 1760) to an artisan family, in the Katsushika district of Edo , Japan . [ 5 ] His
childhood name was TokitarÅ�. [ 1 ] It is believed his father was the mirror-maker Nakajima
Ise, who produced mirrors for the shogun . [ 1 ] His father never made Hokusai an heir, so it's
possible that his mother was a concubine . [ 5 ] Hokusai began painting around the age of six,
possibly learning the art from his father, whose work on mirrors also included the painting of
designs around the mirrors. [ 5 ]

Hokusai was known by at least 30 names during his lifetime. Although the use of multiple names
was a common practice of Japanese artists of the time, the numbers of names he used far exceeds
that of any other major Japanese artist. Hokusai's name changes are so frequent, and so often
related to changes in his artistic production and style, that they are useful for breaking his
life up into periods. [ 5 ]

At the age of 12, he was sent by his father to work in a bookshop and lending library , a popular
type of institution in Japanese cities, where reading books made from wood-cut blocks was a
popular entertainment of the middle and upper classes. [ 6 ] At 14, he became an apprentice to a
wood-carver, where he worked until the age of 18, whereupon he was accepted into the studio of
Katsukawa ShunshÅ� . ShunshÅ� was an artist of ukiyo-e , a style of wood block prints and
paintings that Hokusai would master, and head of the so-called Katsukawa school. [ 1 ]
Ukiyo-e, as practiced by artists like ShunshÅ�, focused on images of the courtesans and
Kabuki actors who were popular in Japan's cities at the time. [ 7 ]

Mount Fuji

After a year, Hokusai's name changed for the first time, when he was dubbed ShunrÅ� by his
master. It was under this name that he published his first prints, a series of pictures of
Kabuki actors published in 1779. During the decade he worked in ShunshÅ�'s studio,
Hokusai was married to his first wife, about whom very little is known except that she died in
the early 1790s. He would marry again in 1797, although this second wife also died after a short
time. He fathered two sons and three daughters with these two wives, and his youngest daughter
Sakae, also known as ÅŒi, eventually became an artist like her father. [ 7 ]

Upon the death of ShunshÅ� in 1793, Hokusai began exploring other styles of art, including
European styles he was exposed to through French and Dutch copper engravings he was able to
acquire. [ 7 ] He was soon expelled from the Katsukawa school by ShunkÅ�, the chief disciple
of ShunshÅ�, possibly due to studies at the rival KanÅ� school . This event was, in his
own words, inspirational: "What really motivated the development of my artistic style was
the embarrassment I suffered at ShunkÅ�'s hands." [ 4 ]

Travellers Crossing the Oi River , one of the ten prints Hokusai added to the original 36 prints
in 36 Views of Mount Fuji . He was prompted to add these prints because of the popularity of the
original series.

Hokusai also changed the subjects of his works, moving away from the images of courtesans and
actors that were the traditional subjects of ukiyo-e. Instead, his work became focused on
landscapes and images of the daily life of Japanese people from a variety of social levels.
This change of subject was a breakthrough in ukiyo-e and in Hokusai's career. [ 7 ] Fireworks at
RyÅ�goku Bridge (1790) dates from this period of Hokusai's life. [ 8 ]

[ edit ] Height of his career



The next period saw Hokusai's association with the Tawaraya School and the adoption of the
name "Tawaraya SÅ�ri." He produced many brush paintings, called surimono , and
illustrations for kyÅ�ka ehon (illustrated book of humorous poems) during this time. In
1798, Hokusai passed his name on to a pupil and set out as an independent artist, free from ties
to a school for the first time, adopting the name Hokusai Tomisa.

Cranes from Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing

By 1800, Hokusai was further developing his use of ukiyo-e for purposes other than
portraiture. He had also adopted the name he would most widely be known by, Katsushika
Hokusai, the former name referring to the part of Edo where he was born and the latter meaning,
'north studio'. That year, he published two collections of landscapes, Famous Sights of the
Eastern Capital and Eight Views of Edo . He also began to attract students of his own,
eventually teaching 50 pupils over the course of his life. [ 7 ]

He became increasingly famous over the next decade, both due to his artwork and his talent for
self-promotion. During a Tokyo festival in 1804, he created a portrait of the Buddhist priest
Daruma said to be 600 feet (180 m) long using a broom and buckets full of ink. Another story
places him in the court of the Shogun Iyenari , invited there to compete with another artist who
practiced more traditional brush stroke painting. Hokusai's painting, created in front of
the Shogun, consisted of painting a blue curve on paper, then chasing a chicken across it whose
feet had been dipped in red paint. He described the painting to the Shogun as a landscape
showing the Tatsuta River with red maple leaves floating in it, winning the competition. [ 9 ]

1807 saw Hokusai collaborate with the popular novelist Takizawa Bakin on a series of
illustrated books. The two did not get along due to artistic differences, and their
collaboration ended during work on their fourth. The publisher, given the choice between
keeping Hokusai or Bakin on the project, opted to keep Hokusai, emphasizing the importance of
illustrations in printed works of the period. [ 10 ]

In 1811, at the age of 51, Hokusai changed his name to Taito and entered the period in which he
created the Hokusai Manga and various etehon , or art manuals. [ 1 ] These etehon , beginning in
1812 with Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing , served as a convenient way to make money and
attract more students. The first book of Hokusai's manga , sketches or caricatures that
influenced the modern form of comics known by the same name, was published in 1814. Together,
his 12 volumes of manga published before 1820 and three more published posthumously include
thousands of drawings of animals, religious figures, and everyday people. They often have
humorous overtones, and were very popular at the time. [ 10 ]

In 1820, Hokusai changed his name yet again, this time to "Iitsu," a change which marked the
start of a period in which he secured fame as an artist throughout Japan (though, given Japan's
isolation from the outside world during his lifetime, his fame overseas came after his
death). It was during the 1820s that Hokusai reached the peak of his career. His most famous
work, 36 Views of Mount Fuji , including the famous Great Wave off Kanagawa , dated from this
period. It proved so popular that Hokusai later added ten more prints to the series. Among the
other popular series of prints he published during this time are A Tour of the Waterfalls of the
Provinces and Unusual Views of Celebrated Bridges in the Provinces . [ 11 ] He also began
producing a number of detailed individual images of flowers and birds, including the
extraordinarily detailed Poppies and Flock of Chickens . [ 12 ]

First Westerners in Japan, by Hokusai, 1817. Caption: "On August 25, 1543, these foreigners
were cast upon the island of Tanegashima , Okuma Province" , followed by the two names
Murashukusha (unknown) and Kirishimota ( António da Mota , also known as Christopher da
Mota). [ 13 ]

The next period, beginning in 1834, saw Hokusai working under the name "GakyÅ� RÅ�jin
Manji" (The Old Man Mad About Art). [ 8 ] It was at this time that Hokusai produced One Hundred
Views of Mount Fuji , another significant landscape series. [ 12 ]

In the postscript to this work, Hokusai writes: â€œ From around the age of six, I had the
habit of sketching from life. I became an artist, and from fifty on began producing works that
won some reputation, but nothing I did before the age of seventy was worthy of attention. At
seventy-three, I began to grasp the structures of birds and beasts, insects and fish, and of
the way plants grow. If I go on trying, I will surely understand them still better by the time I am
eighty-six, so that by ninety I will have penetrated to their essential nature. At one
hundred, I may well have a positively divine understanding of them, while at one hundred and
thirty, forty, or more I will have reached the stage where every dot and every stroke I paint
will be alive. May Heaven, that grants long life, give me the chance to prove that this is no lie.
[ 1 ] â€�

In 1839, disaster struck as a fire destroyed Hokusai's studio and much of his work. By this
time, his career was beginning to wane as younger artists such as AndÅ� Hiroshige became
increasingly popular. But Hokusai never stopped painting, and completed Ducks in a Stream at
the age of 87. [ 14 ]

Constantly seeking to produce better work, he apparently exclaimed on his deathbed, "If only
Heaven will give me just another ten years... Just another five more years, then I could become
a real painter." He died on May 10, 1849, and was buried at the SeikyÅ�-ji in Tokyo (Taito
Ward). [ 1 ]

A short four years after Hokusai's death, an American fleet led by Matthew C. Perry sailed into
Tokyo Bay and forced Japan to open its arms to the west. Hokusai's career spanned the last age of
Japanese history before its interaction with the west would change the course of the nation. [

The Strong Oi Pouring Sake

Hokusai had a long career, but he produced most of his important work after age 60. His most
popular work is the ukiyo-e series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji , which was created between
1826 and 1833. It actually consists of 46 prints (10 of them added after publication). [ 4 ] In
addition, he is responsible for the 1834 One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji
(å¯Œå¶œç™Ÿæ™¯ Fugaku Hyakkei ), a work which "is generally considered the
masterpiece among his landscape picture books." [ 4 ] His ukiyo-e transformed the art form
from a style of portraiture focused on the courtesans and actors popular during the Edo Period
in Japan's cities into a much broader style of art that focused on landscapes, plants, and
animals. [ 7 ]

Both Hokusaiâ€™s choice of nom d'artiste and frequent depiction of Mt. Fuji stem from
his religious beliefs. The name Hokusai means "North Studio (room),"
(åŒ—æ–ŽïŒ‰ an abbreviation of Hokushinsai (åŒ—èŸ°éš›) or "North
Star Studio." Hokusai was a member of the Nichiren sect of Buddhism , who see the North Star as
associated with the deity MyÅ�ken (åŠ™èŠ‹è�©è–©). [ 4 ] Mount Fuji has
traditionally been linked with eternal life. This belief can be traced to the The Tale of the
Bamboo Cutter , where a goddess deposits the elixir of life on the peak. As Henry Smith
expounds, "Thus from an early time, Mt. Fuji was seen as the source of the secret of
immortality, a tradition that was at the heart of Hokusai's own obsession with the mountain."
[ 3 ]

The largest of Hokusai's works is the 15-volume collection Hokusai Manga
(åŒ—æ–ŽæŒ«ç”»), a book crammed with nearly 4,000 sketches that was
published in 1814. [ 4 ] These sketches are often incorrectly considered the precedent to
modern manga , as Hokusai's Manga is a collection of sketches (of animals, people, objects,
etc.), different from the story-based comic-book style of modern manga. [ 4 ]

[ edit ] Influences on art and culture



Hokusai inspired the Hugo Award winning short story by science fiction author Roger Zelazny ,
" 24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai ", in which the protagonist tours the area surrounding Mt.
Fuji , with each stop being a location painted by Hokusai.

His influences also stretched to his contemporaries in nineteenth century Europe whose new
style Art Nouveau , or Jugendstil in Germany, was influenced by him and by Japanese art in
general. This was also part of the larger Impressionist movement, with similar themes to
Hokusai appearing in Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir . Hermann Obrist 's whiplash
motif, or Peitschenhieb , which became seen to exemplify the new movement, is visibly
influenced by Hokusai's work.
