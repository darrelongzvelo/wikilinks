CHARLES MUNGOSHI & DAMBUDZO MARECHERA 1986



Charles Mungoshi is a writer in both Shona and English. He was born in 1947 in a village near
Chivhu in Manyene Tribal Trust Land. His novel 'Waiting for the Rain' has been prescribed
reading for years in Zimbabwean schools. This novel was published in1975, the same year as his
Shona novel 'Ndiko kupindana kwa mazuva' (How time passes). He received an International PEN
award for both these books. Mungoshi's other publications include two collections of short
stories, 'The Setting Sun' and 'The Rolling World' (1987), two collections of children's
stories, 'Stories from a Shona Childhood' (1989) and 'One Day Long Ago' (1991) and a
collection of poems, 'The Milkman Doesn't Only Deliver Milk' (1998). His latest book is
'Walking Still', a collection of short stories, which was awarded the Commonwealth Writers
Prize. He also has a short story in the anthology 'Writing Still' (ed. Irene Staunton, Weaver
Press 2004).



The following text is from a conversation between Charles Mungoshi and Mai Palmberg, an event
arranged within the framework of the series "The Writers' Africa" on 30 September 2003 at the
Nordic Africa Institute in Uppsala. The evening ended with questions from the floor,
indicated below with Q. Mai Palmberg's two closing questions are indicated with MP.

Let me start by asking you why you became a writer?

I don't know what else I should have become. I don't know how these things come about, but I think
my parents wanted me to be something else, and even as late as, well, just before Walking Still
was published, which is about five years ago, my mother said, "I'd wish you'd burn your
library". Anyway, she didn't mean it and some good things have happened also. It probably has
got to do with having your nose in the book and hardly saying anything at all to anyone; I am
talking about when I was growing up.



But I always want to think that it was the loneliness, the way I grew up that led to my choice of
career. It was not a career that I chose, I think it chose me. Traditionally in Shona culture you
live in a round village and with the head of the kraal, somewhere there. But some time in the
1950s my father had to move from our village to start a farm of his own, a farm in the modern sense,
with machines and all the modern technology, although not that productive.



This farm was about 17-something acres and you could get out with 20, 25 to 30 head of cattle for
the whole day, feeding on wild fruits and you did not come back home until probably five o'clock
in the evening. So most of the time I was alone and when I could read, which was five years after I
started school, four or five years, I could read very well in both English and Shona. I always
had books with me.

I am the first son and first child and after me there were three girls, then four boys, and as a boy
you are expected to work with men. I didn't have any friends on this farm; the nearest friend was
about a mile or so away. We were not allowed to visit anyone at all, not because they were cruel,
but there was so much work to do on the farm and I was supposed to be always there, minding the
cattle or running errands, and so on.



Even when I started going to school, my father would go to the school and tell the headmaster
that his son would not be attending the Sunday school because he was the only one he had to help
him on the farm.



And in school, when on Monday, Wednesday and Friday pupils stayed over after school – which
closed at about 1 o'clock – to do sports or outdoor games, my father made sure that I didn't
join the other pupils in those games.



My sisters being girls, I couldn't heard cattle with them. I couldn't work with them because
they were women and they would be with our mother doing other things, so I was always almost on my
own. When I was with my father, you can imagine the kind of conversation we had, "Pick that",
"Did I say to?", "Did I tell you to?", "Run!" and so on, so you would wish to be as far away from him
as possible.



So most of my life was really lived in my head and talking to trees and birds and animals. So I want
to think the loneliness, being on my own, turned me sort of inside and the reading helped along.
It wasn't long before I thought, "Well, I think I can also write a story". I think that's what
happened.



What kind of reading, do you remember?

The very first book I read and I could only identify words like 'this' and ‘was' and 'it' and
'the', something like that, but I couldn't tell how the story went. But I remember very well the
title, it was "Flamingo Island" and I loved the sound of the word 'flamingo'. I would say that
word 'flamingo' and I thought it was wonderful. I didn't know what it meant.



Later on there was a proliferation of Second World War comics and cowboy comics, American
literature, I think, from a publisher called Dell. These are the kind of comics I read. I didn't
realise that then, but I think from very early I was a victim of the power of the word, so from
reading those comics I easily identified with the heroes there and I found I cultivated a
hatred for the Germans, or the Jerries as they were called in these comics, and the Nips or the
Japs, as the Americans put it, and I was several cowboys. I never thought about the Red Indians.
They were my enemies and I looked down upon them.



At that time there was not much literature from here. We are looking at 1959 and the oldest
published Shona novel had been published in 1956. Then there was of course the Christian Bible
the Bible, and it was in a very weird, very old print with letters and it was hard to read. It had
been translated I think by some very enthusiastic white missionary. Some of what was supposed
to be poetry, sounded very strange to the ear. Well, nobody read much, they read the Bible but
otherwise what we called stories we heard from our grandmothers.



I think I became a writer was simply something out of this loneliness, I had to make something
out of my life. I was amassing a lot of words and you either sing them or you shout them, you have to
do something with those words, and I started putting together stories.



So did you do that already in school?

I did. I remember; the first poem I wrote was when I was the first year in school. I had to ask
somebody how to spell the name of a certain girl who sat next to me. I wrote the word down and sent
the letter to her. I think that's the first poem I wrote. Siphiwe.



So it's a one-word poem?

Yes, a one word poem with a whole lot of feelings behind it. Later on I wrote about valleys and
mountains and trees and then the inevitable longer poem, longer version of Siphiwe, "The Love
Story", which was published in a school magazine. And 4-years later in secondary school,
2-years away from my leaving school for good, I had a story published in a commercial magazine
in Harare , Zimbabwe , and the following year another story. These stories were of course love
stories and adventure stories. At that time I used to believe that a good story should have
about two deaths on every page and a lot of blood right from page one to the end and so on and a bit of
the bedroom scene, that was a good story as far as I was concerned.



Later on it came as a surprise when I was reading some English short stories in the school
library. I read some stories, for instance, Ernest Hemingway's stories, and there didn't
seem to be anything happening in those stories. I mean you can have a love story without people
sleeping together; you can have a murder story without anyone being killed on the page and so
on. It was something about the shot, the sound of the gunshot when the curtain is closed, that
was something from Chekov I suppose, and the whole thing about writing a story in a manner that
leaves a lot unsaid. I got interested in that and I found myself writing stories.



But what had happened again was this loneliness, which did not end by going to school. In fact I
think it worsened because I couldn't sort of get myself together to become part of the other
pupils at school. I think the final rift between myself and being part of whatever crowd I was
supposed to have been part of came when I was, I think, thirteen and we were playing football. I
always tried to avoid games where competition was required because I'd never lived or stayed
with anyone or competed with anyone in anything, everything I did it by myself and I was the best
by myself. So whenever I found myself competing I always came out the worst. So I was goalkeeper
in this and somebody kicked the ball right on me and I fell back and I think I must have been out for
two hours, and from there I hated football or any games that could kill, could hurt somebody.



From there I think I became friends with just my books and walking through the forest and I would
maybe avoid going to, play truant from church and go out into the bush. I was very good at hunting
for fruit and people like me for the strange fruits that I brought from the bush.



So when your stories got published and won these competitions, your parents were not very
proud?

No, they were not. In fact what happened with this loneliness the other thing I did was I started
keeping a diary. It was very strange, after writing about a painful experience, I felt very
relaxed, very refreshed and very cheerful and in fact I became a kind of clown, I think. There
was a kind of euphoria after writing a story or something that really pained me I became very
funny. I don't know how to say it but one of the things that I became good at is acting on stage and
so on.



And I think that also served me, that held me from writing gory stories, melodramatic stories
into writing actually the kind of writing that I'm writing now, when.



Do you think that literature in Zimbabwe has gone through a stage of literature for education
and social/political values?

Yes, when I went to school the teachers wrote on the black board "Think in English, Talk in
English, Act in English". So they were very serious about education and that is what they
taught. In secondary school we had plays, simplified stories; we had Shakespeare, we had
Oliver Twist – all those stories. Some I don't know where they came from but I had those in
primary school and in secondary school.



Well, I meant after independence. Some say that the early literature of independent Zimbabwe
was not sort of following the nationalist call?

OK, looking at literature in Zimbabwe, and books like my 'Waiting for the Rain', Stanley
Nyamfukudza's 'Non-Believer's Journey', Dambudzo Marechera's 'House of Hunger' and the
other books – yes, they were seen as books without political ideologies, without any
historical content, and as books that are individual or egoistic, and all that kind of things;
there was nothing at all that would help there.



And our only response was that it was at least an analysis of and we were looking into the
individual to see how and why the individual suffers and could you please offer an answer, if
there is any answer? It's simply a laying open of what is bothering, a diagnosis of what's wrong
with us, and they said, "No, ideologically this is empty".



But then, only recently I hear, and it's the same university and probably these might have been
students in secondary school but now they are the lecturers, they are talking of this same book
of mine again. I haven't changed a single word, but now they say it means something, this is one
of the greatest things that have happened too. So it is interesting in the light of talk on
self-censorship that a criticism of the present seems to have been written already in a book
many years ago, which was then stamped as being ideologically empty.



Q. You have written your short stories, novels, and columns, but you have also translated, for
example, Ngugi wa Thiongo's The Grain of Wheat. Could you tell us why you did that, and what that
novel meant to you?

I was editor of a publishing house and we were all eyes open, looking around for the great novel
of out of the struggle. I felt very bad, I couldn't write the Shona war novel. I really liked 'The
Grain of Wheat', it was skilfully plotted and it did not tell that this is how it was, and this is
right and this is wrong, and he has complex characters, and gave alternative
interpretations.



And I felt reading The Grain of Wheat it that it was almost the same as in Zimbabwe, the British of
the Highlands, the farms and the people living in the compounds and the people of the land
dissatisfied, the educational system, the same sort of characters, headmasters and so on and
the priests, all of it. I felt that Mau Mau was just like our Chimurenga.



So I felt that this would be of some help to the Shona writers who were trying to write about the
war. I am not sure whether any of our authors did get inspired by it or learnt how to chisel the
characters. But some have later written very well about the struggle, not as speeches but as
subjective experiences, such as Alexander Kanengoni. 'Effortless Tears', I think that is
one wonderful story. It is someone being honest about his or her experience, not trying to
cover it up with pseudo-heroics and that kind of thing.



Q: You were talking about the characters in the Chimurenga, and you have described the second
Chimurenga. If you wrote about it, how would you describe the characters in the third
Chimurenga?

The characters? Which one is this third? Is it to be fought or has it been fought already?



Q: Are you very straight?

Where is it, the third Chimurenga? When was it?



Q: Why do you ask me?

Because you used the expression.



Q: But you know perfectly well what it is.

No, I don't. Oh, the one they call the third Chimurenga?



Q: The one going on right now.

I'm still confused about it, I don't know who is right or who is wrong. I don't even know whether
we talk of right or wrong.



I think they are all what they've always been, trying to cheat each other. It's intrigue, and
I'm better then you are and it is survival of the fittest. It is the old story, isn't it? It is lies
you can do this thing it as long as you don't get caught. I think it's the same old - I need to sit
down and write a story to illustrate. As the father who gives his children a snake when they ask
for bread.



MP: Can I ask one thing that I forgot to ask before, this book 'Walking Still' was produced in
1997, right? Looking to the future, are you working on anything now?

I think I'll deal with the third Chimurenga.



MP: Now that you hear about it?

Now that I hear about it, it's interesting how we say third and second Chimurenga when the
people are really the same people who are afraid, who fight, who are greedy, who hate their own
or who twist, the same old - who love. I mean, they loved in the second, now they still love, they
hate, and it's always about people who don't deliver, isn't it? It is the old hat and the same old
characters, I suppose. With cell phones.

Walter Kamba was the first Vice Chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe. Appointed in 1981,
his devotion to the principle of academic freedom led to public disagreement with Robert
Mugabe, and eventually to early retirement in 1991.However, he was nevertheless appointed
Vice Chairman of the Constitutional Commission set up with Mugabe's agreement in 1999 to
advise on a route for the President's retirement - proposals which were never acted upon.



During the years of Southern Rhodesia's illegal declaration of independence, when senior
academic positions were not open to black Zimbabweans, Kamba pursued his academic career
abroad.



He obtained BA and LLB degrees from University of Cape Town and after serving his

articles in Harare, practiced as an attorney in the country before moving to Yale University
in the US where he completed an LLM and later became dean of law at the

University of Dundee.



In 1979 he attended the constitutional conference on the future of Rhodesia at Lancaster
House as legal adviser to the delegations of Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, playing a
substantial part in the development of the constitution of the newly independent state of
Zimbabwe.



Returning to Harare in 1980, he took charge of the University, which he transformed from a
small colonial university college . Kamba's great achievement was to expand substantially
the overall size of the University, of its black Zimbabwean intake and of its range of academic
studies, without compromising the quality of education.



At the ceremony for 1982 graduates, Kamba was brave enough to speak out publicly, and in the
presence of Mugabe, about the undesirability of government interference in the academic
affairs of the University.



Kamba was involved in numerous other organisations, as Chairman of the Association of
Eastern and Southern African Universities, President of the International Association of
Universities, Founding Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Namibia, amongst
others, and at the time of his death, was the Herbert Chitepo UNESCO Professor of Human Rights,
Democracy, Peace and Governance at the University of Zimbabwe <!--

Canaan Sodindo Banana (5 March 1936 – 10 November 2003) served as the first President of
Zimbabwe from 18 April 1980 until 31 December 1987. A Methodist minister, he held the largely
ceremonial office of the presidency while his eventual successor, Robert Mugabe, served as
Prime Minister of Zimbabwe.



During his lifetime, Banana brought together two of the country's political parties, the
Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU),
became a diplomat for the Organisation of African Unity, and headed the religious department
of the University of Zimbabwe. His later life was complicated by charges of sodomy - a crime in
Zimbabwe - which he denied and for which he was later imprisoned.

Zimbabweans owe a great debt of gratitude to Rev Canaan Banana. As speakers from across the
political divide and those representing the Christian community said, Rev Banana was,
despite his weaknesses, a good and patriotic Zimbabwean. He played a very crucial role in the
liberation struggle and in the unification of the country following the early 1980s
Matabeleland troubles. He did justice, he loved mercy, he walked humbly with his God.



Banana was born in 1936 in Esiphezini Communal Area, Southern Rhodesia near Esigodini (now in
Matabeleland South). His parents were a Ndebele-cultured mother and a Malawian father who
had emigrated to Rhodesia. He was educated by missionaries in a local school and later studied
at a teacher training institute.[1]



He married Janet Mbuyazwe[2] in 1961, and they had four children together. He took a diploma in
theology at Epworth Theological College in Harare and was ordained as a United Methodist
minister in 1962. He was a student at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C. in 1974
and 1975. Becoming involved in politics, he denounced Ian Smith's practices as a prime
minister, took part in the rising[3] transnational black liberation ideo-religious
movements, and came to be vice-president of the African National Council.[1]



He wrote a book entitled The Gospel According To The Ghetto, and a personalised version of the
Lord's Prayer.

Sodomy charges and imprisonment



The former president's term in office was a subject of scandal in later years, marking his
legacy to national independence social movements in Africa and abroad. In 1997, Banana was
arrested in Zimbabwe on charges of sodomy, following accusations made during the murder
trial of his former bodyguard, Jefta Dube.[1] The charges related to allegations from the
state prosecutor that Banana had misused his power while he was president to coerce numerous
men in positions of service (ranging from domestic staff to security guards, and even members
of sports teams for whom he had acted as referee) into accepting sexual advances. Banana was
found guilty of eleven charges of sodomy, attempted sodomy and indecent assault in 1998. He
denied all charges, saying that homosexuality is "defiant, abominable and wrong", and the
allegations made against him were "pathological lies" intended to destroy his political
career.[5] Janet Banana later acknowledged her husband's indiscretions, even though she
considered the charges against him to be politically motivated.[6]

He fled to South Africa whilst released on bail before he could be imprisoned, apparently
believing Mugabe was planning his death. He returned to Zimbabwe in December 1998, after a
meeting with Nelson Mandela, who convinced him to face the ruling. Banana was sentenced on 18
January 1999 to ten years in jail, nine years suspended, and was also defrocked. He actually
served six months in an open prison before being released in January 2001.



On 10 November 2003, Banana died of cancer,[7] in London, according to a report delivered by
the Zimbabwean High Commissioner. The Guardian, a London-based newspaper, has claimed that
Banana had traveled to South Africa, where he eventually died, in order to receive
appropriate treatment for his cancer; however, this dispute relies upon uncorroborated
testimonial evidence.[1] He was buried in Zimbabwe in late November 2003. President Robert
Mugabe called him "a rare gift to the nation" in a radio address.[8] Banana was buried without
the full honours that are traditionally accorded to former heads of state.[4] The then
politburo Secretary for Information and Publicity Nathan Shamuyarira told state radio that
"they (the politburo) could not accord Banana hero status as a matter of principle."[9] His
wife sought political asylum in Britain in October 2000 under a preexisting accord.[4]

MARK CHAVHUNDUKA JOURNALIST & PUBLISHER 100 GREATEST ZIMBABWEANS

A s founding editor of Zimbabwe 's independent Sunday newspaper, the Standard, the
award-winning journalist and publisher Mark Chavunduka, who died aged 36, was a champion for
media freedom in southern Africa .



His paper became a symbol of resistance among his country's journalists, and a thorn in the
flesh of President Robert Mugabe's government. He exposed the corruption and political
intimidation rife in Zimbabwe , and his outspokenness made the Standard an internationally
recognised voice for those opposed to Mugabe's tyranny.

<!-- /* set the domain in anticipation of the ad*/ if(setDomainForAds) { setDomainForAds();

Chavunduka entered the limelight in 1999, when the Standard's chief writer, Ray Choto,
reported on widespread Zimbabwean army unrest over the deployment of up to 14,000 troops in
the civil war then raging in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Choto claimed that 23
disgruntled soldiers had been detained for inciting mutiny against Mugabe.



For more than 10 days, Chavunduka and Choto were detained incommunicado at Cranborne
barracks near Harare . Their lawyer, Simon Bull, said both men were subjected to electric
shocks on their genitals, hands and feet by military interrogators, and had their heads
submerged in drums of water.



They were also blindfolded, stripped naked, made to do push-ups in the rain, and to roll in wet
grass to clean the blood from their bodies after beating.



Independent medical sources confirmed the torture allegations, and the incident, seen by
many as the most outrageous attack on press freedom in Zimbabwe since independence, drew
worldwide condemnation.



President Mugabe, however, refused to condemn the torture. Instead, he threatened "very
stern measures" against the independent press, warned writers not to antagonise the army,
and ignored a court order to release the two journalists.



Chavunduka was born into a prominent Zimbabwean family in the capital, Salisbury (now Harare
). His father, Dr Dexter Chavunduka, was Zimbabwe 's first black veterinary surgeon, and a
member of parliament nominated by Mugabe for his expertise in animal husbandry.



As vice chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe , Mark's uncle, Professor Gordon
Chavunduka, a veteran nationalist, had conferred an honorary degree on Mugabe. His aunt,
Sarah Kachingwe, was a top civil servant.



Educated at the prestigious St George's secondary school, Chavunduka graduated from Harare
Polytechnic with a diploma in mass communication and journalism. He began his career as a
business reporter, and later news editor, with the Financial Gazette.



In 1991, aged 24, he became the youngest editor of a national publication when he took over the
monthly magazine, Parade, whose readership he increased to more than two million.



He became editor of the Standard in April 1997, and, under him, the circulation rose from
12,000 to 37,000.

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwzH__R8L6I/AAAAAAAAALA/e6eZHPrWN_M/s400/thestandard_logo.gif

After his release, he was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder at the London-based
Medical Foundation for the Treatment of Torture Victims.



Two years ago, Chavunduka won a Nieman fellowship at Harvard University , but, last year,
returned home.



"My family all said I should have stayed in the US, but I am so angry about the way we were
treated," he said, "and I won't give the government the satisfaction of knowing I've run
away."



Last April, he resigned as editor of the Standard after taking over the majority shareholding
in the local Thomson Publications (Pvt).



The cause of the illness that led to his death was not announced. He is survived by his wife, two
daughters and a son.



Mark Gova Chavunduka, journalist and publisher, born November 28 1965 ; died November 11,
2002.

Enoch Dumbutshena (20 April 1920 – 14 December 2000) was a distinguished Zimbabwean judge
known for defending the independence of that country's judicial branch.



He became Zimbabwe's first black judge in 1980 and served as Chief Justice from 1984 to 1990.
Dumbutshena's decisions were often highly critical of President Robert Mugabe and his
government.



A former member of the International Commission of Jurists, he unsuccessfully attempted to
launch a political career of his own in 1993 by founding the market liberal Forum Party. He died
in late 2000 of liver cancer.

Henry Khaaba Olonga (born 3 July 1976 in Lusaka, Zambia) was a cricket player for Zimbabwe. He
made his international debut in a Test match against Pakistan at Harare in 1995, at age 18
years, 212 days, becoming the youngest player to represent Zimbabwe. He helped Zimbabwe to
its first ever Test victory in that game. A right arm fast bowler, Olonga was the first black
cricketer to play for Zimbabwe and is the second Zambian-born Test cricketer after Phil
Edmonds of England.

Olonga achieved international recognition (along with team mate Andy Flower) in 2003 by
wearing a black armband in a Cricket World Cup match to protest against the policies of
Zimbabwe's government, led by Robert Mugabe.

OLONGA WEARING A BLACK ARMBAND TO PROTEST POLICIES OF ZIMBABWE'S GOVT

He and Flower released a statement on 10 February, stating in part: In all the circumstances,
we have decided that we will each wear a black armband for the duration of the World Cup. In doing
so we are mourning the death of democracy in our beloved Zimbabwe. In doing so we are making a
silent plea to those responsible to stop the abuse of human rights in Zimbabwe. In doing so, we
pray that our small action may help to restore sanity and dignity to our nation.



This act led to a warrant issued in Zimbabwe for Olonga's arrest on charges of treason (which
carries the death penalty in Zimbabwe) and forced him to retire from international cricket
and temporarily go into hiding. He is now pursuing a career as a singer and a cricket
commentator.

Tribute to Luciano Pavarroti by Henry Olonga, Nessun Dorma







Olonga played 30 Test matches for Zimbabwe, taking 68 wickets with a bowling average of 38.52,
and 50 one-day internationals, taking 58 wickets at an average of 34.08. He holds the record
for the best bowling in a one-day international by a Zimbabwean, with figures of 6/19 against
England at Cape Town in 2000.

We acknowledge and recognize the contribution made by the late veteran politician and
businessman Honorable Dr Patrick Kombayi.



Patrick Kombayi (November 2, 1938 – June 20, 2009[1]) was a Zimbabwean businessman, a
former mayor of Gweru and an active member of the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai
faction in the Midlands Province. He served in the Senate of Zimbabwe for Chirumhanzu-Gweru
senatorial constituency.



Dr Kombayi was buried in Gweru on the 27th of July 2009, after he succumbed from gunshot wounds
sustained in the 4 March 1990 foiled assassination attempt by the late Simon Muzenda’s
bodyguards Kizito Chivamba and Elias Kanengoni.



The late Kombayi played a pivotal during the liberation struggle when he housed, clothed,
financed and fed leaders of the revolutionary movements ZIPRA and ZANLA IN Zambia.



Robert Mugabe, Hebert Chitepo, Rugare Gumbo, and many other comrades in the liberation
struggle all benefited from Kombayi’s courtesy during their stay in Zambia.



In 2001 he assisted several student leaders who had been expelled at the Midlands State
Universty (MSU).The union continued to get assistance and support from him up until the time
of his death.



Go well great politician, go well great businessman, go well great revolutionary, Five Star

Byron Black



He is the brother of Cara and Wayne Black, both professional tennis players. He attended the
University of Southern California and was an All-American as named by the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association (ITA).



In 1995 Black was a US Open quarterfinalist and in 2000 he reached the same round at Wimbledon.
His highest career singles ranking was World No. 22, which he achieved in June 1996.



An accomplished doubles player, Black became world no. 1 in doubles in February 1994. He won
the 1994 French Open partnering Jonathan Stark. Black was a doubles finalist in three other
majors, the 1994 and 2001 Australian Opens and 1996 Wimbledon.



Black is one of the few professional players to have played with a double-handed forehand.



Black formed the core of the Zimbabwean Davis Cup team with his brother Wayne.



Byron's father Don had a grass court in Highlands, Harare on which Byron honed his skills. As a
junior Byron played tennis for Prince Edward School in Harare. On one occasion as a 13 year old
he thrashed an 18 year old Bunny Eales of Oriel Boys 6-1 6-1 in an interschools game. He moved to
Oriel Boys High School to increase his exposure to stronger players, like Greig Rodgers and
Mark Gurr, future Davis Cup players for Zimbabwe. Byron played in Club Open Tournaments in
Harare as well as the Zimbabwe Open tournament for several years before turning
professional. At that time, anyone could enter the Zimbabwe open and you could find yourself
playing Byron in the first round.

Simon "Chopper" Chimbetu, one of ’s most successful and beloved local musicians died on
Sunday, August 14, in Harare . He was 50. A veteran of Harare ’s intense nightlife for over two
decades, Chimbetu saw his highs and lows. As he died, he was emerging from controversy
surrounding his backing of the government’s land-grab policy. But his 2004 album “10
Million Pound Reward” was bringing him back into public favor in recent months. Six years
earlier, when I lived in Harare, Chimbetu’s shows were the top draw in Harare, as stylish,
polished, and tuneful a take on Zimbabwe’s own brand of guitar-based rumba—sometimes
called sungura—as you could find.



Chimbetu was born and raised in Makwiru, Chegutu area, Mashonaland West in 1955. His parents
were amateur musicians, and he fondly recalled his father drumming and his mother singing
when he was a child. During the liberation war he and his three brothers and four sisters lived
on Dendera Farm in Mozmbique. He returned after independence to work with a pioneering
sungura band called The Marxist Brothers. When we spoke in 2001, he seemed a little
embarrassed about the name, calling it a “nickname,” and explaining that it made more
sense in the afterglow of the independence struggle, which was supported by communists in the
USSR and China.

When he formed his own band in the early 90s, he called it the Dendera Kings. The name harks back
to his experience during the war years, but as he explained in 2001, it has a deeper meaning.
“Dendera is an African bird,” he said. “It is found in tropical savannah areas. In
English it is called a ground hornbill. It’s quite a big bird. Why we chose that title is that
the bird can be heard from 10 km away. Very early in the morning, it produces a powerful sound,
like a drum. That is a very respected bird in the region.” The band too was very respected,
producing over 15 albums, and performing long, ecstatic shows all over the country.







Chimbetu was never a political singer, but he did address social issues, and sometimes that
was perceived as political. “I think when you are a writer, a musician, an artist,” he
said, “an artist is mostly concerned about the poor. An artist is supposed to be concerned
with the majority of the people. That’s where we belong.” His 2000 song “Ndare Newa”
dramatized the plight of workers who spent their entire Friday paycheck by Sunday night, and
had to scrounge all week before receiving another. The song stirred minor controversy as some
took it as implicitly critical of the government. His loyalty to the Mugabe regime was later
reinforced, however, when he participated in its aggressive land grab policy by occupying a
500 hectare farm in Kadoma. At the same time, he spoke out against violence and declared
himself “a friend to all Zimbabweans.”



The farm episode nevertheless cost him some popular support, but at the time of his death, he
was clearly on the rebound, playing frequent shows in the as well as . A journalist in 2004
described him as “fit as a fiddle,” and reports say he died quickly from an “undisclosed
illness.” When he was buried on August 17, hoards of people clogged the streets of Harare .
All Zimbabweans mourn Chimbetu, clearly one of the musical giants of his time.

Zimbabwe Surgeon Provides Relief to Cataract Patients



The current political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe has severely affected hospitals and
other public service providers.. Essential drugs such as painkillers are in short supply and
many medical personnel have left the country in search of money, status and safety. Despite
the demand for Zimbabwean doctors and nurses overseas, some have remained home to assist
their fellow countryman. From Harare, reporter Derek Moyo takes a look at one medical
professional who’s bringing relief to thousands who never thought they’d see another
day.



The 22-year-old woman had not seen her mother in years, and had never seen her own baby. Her life
changed the moment Dr. Solomon Guramatunhu traveled to her village in Ndola, Zambia, and
removed her cataracts.



He recounts the experience..



"You can imagine,he said, "this is somebody who is now totally blind, has given birth and [she]
had not seen their child and had not seen her mother for 3 years. When we operated on her, she
opened her eyes. She could see her child for the very first time and could see her mother again. I
can never forget her face. She just could not believe it and then she smiled and she started
crying and everybody around started crying."

Dr Solomon Guramatunhu (R)



The young woman is just one of thousands who’ve had their futures brought back into focus by
Dr. Guramatunhu and fellow colleagues of the Eyes for Africa program.



Cataracts occur when any part of the primary focusing mechanism, the crystalline lens behind
the iris, becomes cloudy, opaque or yellow. This result is the failure of the lens to let in
light, and vision is reduced or eliminated.



For paying clients, the 30-minute operation would cost about 55 million Zimbabwe dollars For
the continent’s poor, the service is free.



EYE SIGHT, AIDS, AND THE ELDERLY





Dr Guramatunhu estimates that one percent of all Zimbabweans is blind – and an overwhelming
majority of the cases are due to cataracts.



Many of those affected are elderly people with children who have died of AIDS. As surviving
grandparents, they are expected to look after the children. But because of their own
blindness, it’s sometimes the other way around.



"In the rural areas today," he said, "we talk of a double tragedy because we have elderly
people, grandmothers, grandfathers who have lost off spring due to hiv/aids, so they become
the custodians of the orphans. The grandparents then go blind because of cataracts, which
means they can not look after those orphans. [So] you end up with these little children looking
after their grandparents, and most of them then opt out of school to be able to look after
[them]."



ECONOMICS AND SURGERY



So far, over 10, 000 people, including the elderly, have been helped.



They include between 100 and 120 people over the three-day periods Dr Guramatunhu allots for
travel to rural areas.



He says logistical problems prevent the doctors from reaching more people.



" A lot of these people cannot afford the bus fare to come to the hospital." he said. "….The
ordinary person, if you have a grandmother or grandfather has cataracts or is blind, we do
expect you to do your bit maybe provide them transport to come to the clinic."



A LIFE OF PRIVILEDGE



Most of those helped are the disadvantaged.



In contrast, the well-known ophthalmologist has led a life of relative privilege, with a
costly education in Scotland cushioned by scholarships.



He said, "If you speak to a lot of people who today are privileged, somewhere along the line they
would have obtained assistance from somebody else. So I think, privilege comes with
responsibility. One can help in various ways and I think everybody is in a position to help
somebody else regardless of their status."



Today, Dr Guramatunhu is an honorary lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe and has his own
private eye surgery in Harare.



During a stint in government, he helped convince medical aid societies to purchase eye
equipment so that local people no longer had to travel to South Africa for cataract surgery and
laser treatment.



EYE ON THE FUTURE



Dr. Guramatunhu’s own future means expanding the number of operations, and the number of
countries, Eyes for Africa can cover.



The group conducts up to 5,000 operations per year, but the Zimbabwean ophthalmologist would
like to see that number doubled, or even tripled.



For this, the soft-spoken doctor has a new hat – as aggressive fund-raiser.



His group has been raising money in various countries to ensure that more people have their
sight restored. Dr Guramatunhu said this year several golf tournaments have raised millions
of Zimbabwean dollars. Rotary clubs in Zimbabwe and South Africa have offered generous
support to the program.



A holder of the International Ophthalmologist Education Award, Dr Guramatunhu is the
founding president of the Ophthalmological Society of Zimbabwe and the founding chairman of
Eyes for Africa.



He is also a member of the American Society of Cataracts and Refractive Surgeons, the European
Society of Cataracts and Refractive Surgeons, the International Society of Refractive
Surgery, the Corneal Society, the European Vitreo-retinal Society and Euretina.

Apart from heading Eyes for Africa, he has partnered with regional and international
colleagues to offer free surgery in Zambia, Namibia, Angola and Vietnam.



Earlier this month, Dr Guramatunhu participated in The Sunday Mail and Partners in the
Community initiative, which seeks to facilitate sustainable relief and growth to
vulnerable members of society.

He conducted an eye clinic at Copota School for the Blind in Masvingo where he examined 50
students. There was renewed hope among some of the students that they could regain their sight
once corrective measures were taken.



Speaking after the clinic, Dr Guramatunhu said: “I believe it is important for us to make a
difference in society.



“We should have new thinking and change our mentality towards society.”

BETTY MAKONI GIRL CHILD NETWORK 100 GREATEST ZIMBABWEANS CHIEF

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hope was 14 years old when her uncle raped her.



"He trapped me to the ground and covered my mouth with his hand," said the 18-year-old from
Zimbabwe. "He threatened to kill me if I ever told anybody."



So, she kept quiet.



"After a while people around the villages started saying that I looked pregnant," she said.



Hope was not only pregnant, but her uncle had infected her with HIV.







Like many young girls in Zimbabwe, Hope was the victim of a widely held belief that if a man with
HIV or AIDS rapes a virgin he will be cured of his disease. This so-called virgin myth,
perpetuated by Zimbabwe's traditional healers, has led to the rape of hundreds of girls,
according to UNICEF. Some of those victims are too young to walk, much less protect
themselves.



Betty Makoni has fought for nearly a decade to protect her country's young girls from sexual
abuse. And she's witnessed some of the worst cases of the myth in action.



"The youngest girl I ever came across was a day-old baby who was raped," said Makoni, 37.



Through her Girl Child Network (GCN), Makoni has helped rescue 35,000 girls from abuse --
including Hope; thousands more have found an empowering community and a public forum in which
to speak out. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year



"Ten girls per day report rape cases," she said. "It means if we keep quiet, at least 3,600 girls
per year may just be contracting HIV and AIDS."



Makoni's own tragic experiences fuel her fierce determination.



"I was raped when I was 6 years old," she recalled. Her attacker was a local shopkeeper. Makoni
said her mother would not allow her to report the abuse.



"She said, 'Shh, we don't say that in public,' " Makoni remembered. "I had no shoulder to cry
on."



Three years later, she witnessed her father murder her mother. In that moment, Makoni said she
realized the potentially deadly consequence of a woman's silence.



"I told myself that no girl or woman will suffer the same again," she said.



Believing an education would provide her the best opportunity and means to speak out, Makoni
earned two university degrees and became a teacher. While teaching, she noticed that girls
were dropping out of school at an alarming rate. She approached her students with an idea.



"I [said] to girls, 'Let's have our own space where we talk and find solutions,' " Makoni said.
Girl Child Network was born.



By the end of the first year, there were 100 GCN clubs throughout Zimbabwe where girls could
find support. Makoni said she was not surprised: "Every woman and girl identified with the
issues that we were raising," she said.



In 2000, she quit her teaching job to volunteer with GCN full time. "I decided to become an
advocate because I walked my own journey to survival," she said.



The following year Makoni successfully procured a piece of land and opened the
organization's first empowerment village, designed to provide a haven for girls who have
been abused. Girls are either rescued or referred to the village by social services, the
police and the community. The healing begins as soon as a girl arrives.



"In the first 72 hours, a girl is provided with emergency medication, reinstatement in
school, as well as counseling," said Makoni.



It is important to her that the girls are in charge of their own healing. "It gives them the
confidence to transform from victims to leaders," she explained.



The process helped Hope work through the times when she said "I thought my life had come to end."



"They offered all they could ... as I was in a traumatized state," she said. "I really
appreciate what [Betty Makoni] has done and is doing in my life."



Today, GCN has grown to 700 girls' clubs and three empowerment villages across Zimbabwe. An
estimated 300,000 girls have received assistance.



For those who were at greatest risk, Makoni believes that help was especially critical. "If my
organization didn't exist, the 35,000 girls I've saved from rape and abuse could have died by
now," she said.



But for Makoni, speaking out came with a high personal cost. In 2008, she was forced to flee her
native country. "I left Zimbabwe because my life was in danger as a result of my project being
interpreted politically."



Today, she lives with her family in the United Kingdom. She still serves as executive director
of her organization and shows no signs of slowing down.



GCN has partnered with the DOVE project, a group based in Essex, England, that deals with
domestic violence.



"We are now bringing the girls from a local community to the international scene," she said.



Her efforts in Zimbabwe will also be highlighted in an upcoming documentary, Tapestries of
Hope.



Makoni says nothing will end her fight for the rights of women and girls. "This is the job I have
always wanted to do, because it gives me fulfillment. And in girls I see myself every day."

Geoffrey Nyarota began his journalism career at The Herald in Zimbabwe in 1978. Nyarota also
served as editor of The Chronicle , a daily in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city.
During his tenure, The Chronicle published a series of articles exposing large-scale
corruption involving government ministers and officials. As a result, the government,
which owned the paper, removed Nyarota as editor. He then moved to The Financial Gazette , a
weekly business and financial newspaper, and later joined the Nordic-Sadc Journalism
Centre in Maputo, Mozambique.



On his return to Zimbabwe in 1999, Nyarota founded The Daily News , the country's only
independent daily newspaper. The newspaper's aggressive efforts to uncover corruption and
human rights abuses made it the most widely read paper in the country. On Dec. 30, 2002, Nyarota
was fired as editor on what management said were administrative grounds. But his dismissal
came amid an escalating campaign by President Robert Mugabe's government to quiet criticism
from independent news outlets. Nyarota fled to South Africa after police visited his home at
midnight. Previously he had been arrested on six occasions while his newspaper was the target
of a bomb attack twice.

He has been at Harvard University since the beginning of 2003 under the auspices of the Nieman
Fellowship Program for Journalists. As a Carr Center Fellow, he proposes to undertake
research on ethnicity as a factor in the liberation struggle and post-independence national
politics of Zimbabwe. He was awarded a Knight International Press Fellowship Award in 2001
and an International Press Freedom award from the Committee to Protect Journalists.







In May 2002, Nyarota was awarded the 2002 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize and
the World Association of Newspaper Golden Pen Award the same year. In all, he has received nine
international media awards for his work as a journalist in Zimbabwe.

SOMEWHERE in the rural area of Buhera, lies the Man Mountain -- known to the world simply as
Kilimanjaro -- who boxed his way from Mbare to rule the African continent.



Proud Chinembiri, the late heavyweight boxing champion, took his sport to another level in
this country in the category where the biggest and meanest boxers fight.



The big man turned himself into a fierce fighting machine and made his country proud by winning
the African heavyweight championship and even getting into contention for a fight for the
world heavyweight crown.



No Zimbabwean heavyweight boxer has scaled similar heights like Kilimanjaro.



Even those who lost in their duel against him are proud of the moment that they went into the ring
with this fighting machine.



One of them is John "Bombaphani Bonyongo Destroyer" Mutema -- the last man to fight the Man
Mountain.

He was beaten in the fourth round of their contest and, this week, told The Herald Sport about
his pride of having faced Kilimanjaro.



"I was the last man to fight Kilimanajaro and he beat me on technicality after I suffered a gash
above the right eye," said Bonyongo this week.



"It was the greatest fight of my life. I quit boxing in 1999 after the death of Kilimanjaro since
there was no longer a heavyweight boxer to fight at that time.

ZIMBABWE soccer captain and Manchester City striker Benjani Mwaruwari’s success story
reads like a fairytale. He played in the Zimbabwean Premier League for not more than a year, and
he was off on a journey that has taken him around the world. This is The Truth About Benjani
Mwaruwari:

Born: August 13, 1978



Home Town: Bulawayo



Marital Status: Married to Thembi, with four children.



Briefly, tell us where it all started, and how you got here?



I first played for Young Blood, a junior team in Bulawayo, and then I moved to Highlanders and
played in the reserves there. I joined Lulu Rovers, and then moved to the University of
Zimbabwe before a stint at Air Zimbabwe.



I was on the verge of joining AmaZulu in 1999 but I was called up for the Zimbabwe national team
which played at Thabo Mbeki’s inauguration in South Africa. I played well in the game and I
was approached by Jomo Sono who signed me for Jomo Cosmos.



I didn’t stay long there as I soon moved to Grasshoppers Zurich in Switzerland. A move to
Auxerre in France followed. Harry Rednkapp signed me for Portsmouth in 2006 and a few years
later, I am here at Manchester City.

What did you want to be when you were little?



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwmonjaZh9I/AAAAAAAAAHY/Ma_kAJOgWzU/s400/benjani+mwariwaru.jpg



I never really wanted to be anything … You can say I had no serious ambition. Some kids had all
these grand ambitions of being doctors and so on, but I never really set myself a target. I was
just floating along.



What were you like at school?

I was always an athlete at primary school. I liked running, long jump and football. I did
everything, I was a proper athlete and I was quick. I think I set the 100m and 200m records at
Mhali Primary School in Bulawayo.



I lost interest in running when I got to secondary, because I got more hooked on football. At
that time, I was inspired by Ian Wright. I followed his career like religion, and I liked his
natural goal scoring ability. I guess that makes me an Arsenal supporter, yes I was!





What would you say has been the highlight of your career?



I think more than anything else I would say playing for all these years in Europe. It’s the
hardest thing to break into European teams and I have managed it at four teams. I have scored
some memorable goals along the way. Two goals stand out -- one scored against Barcelona when I
was still at Grasshoppers, and the other for Jomo Cosmos against Kaizer Chiefs. The goals were
almost similar in that I just stepped out of the centre circle and struck the ball sweetly into
the nets.



What habit do you wish you could change?



I am always sleeping when I have nothing to do. When I do have some things to do, I am usually
tired.

How do you deal with anger and what gets you upset?



That’s my other problem. I have a short temper, but now I am trying to be calmer. There are a lot
of things that get me upset, because usually when you have a short temper, you easily get angry
at the slightest provocation. Sometimes you get upset but handle it better. I guess it goes
with patience, I have no patience. When I want something, I want it done there and then. I
don’t want to wait.

What are you most afraid of?



Ships and planes! I use planes because there is no other means, but flying wrecks my nerves.
With ships, I tell myself that if there is any funny mishap, then I am dead because I am a very bad
swimmer. So before going on one, I would be thinking what will happen when it sinks?

If your house burnt down, what would you save?



My phone and passport. Invaluable.



How would you describe yourself in a personal ad?



I am very, very shy and you know when you are shy, you are also quiet. I like being where the people
are, because I grew up among people. I am very sociable and easy going.

How is your love life?



I am married to Thembi and have four kids -- Colines, Benjani Junior, Belle (which is French for
Beauty) and Tiyezhe who was born in January.

What’s your idea of a sexy woman?



Someone like Angelina Jolie. Perhaps I would do myself a favour byHow would you describe

When you stop playing, how are you going to spend your time?

TRIBUTE TO BENJANI MWARUWARI FROM FANS





I want to raise my kids until they are employed and able to fend for themselves. I want them to
have a better childhood than I had and a good life. I also plan to have a football academy in
Zimbabwe for our promising young players and hopefully get them to play in Europe. There is no
reason why we can’t have more Zimbabweans playing in the European leagues. saying someone

Moses Chunga (born 17 October 1965 in Lytton, a suburb in the west of Harare) played for
Dynamos, one of the greatest Zimbabwean football teams, and for the Zimbabwe national
football team in the position of playmaker. He was born to parents of Malawian descent and like
Benjani Mwaruwari chose to represent his nation of birth, Zimbabwe, internationally.



Moses Chunga is considered by many football enthusiasts as arguably the greatest football
player ever produced in Zimbabwe. Actually, he has attained legendary status, and many
rumours abound him.

One frustrating issue when trying to gather information about him, other Zimbabwean legends
of his time, and before is that there is sparse written literature on them, which may tend to
reduce anything said about them to red herring. However, there seems to be some verifiable
facts about him that give him his legendary status. For example, Moses Chunga was the first
(black) Zimbabwean to join a European league (after independence). Only one or a very few
(Black) player(s) – e.g., Freddie Mukwesha- appear to have achieved this feat before him,
although many more were to follow his footsteps, some joining much better leagues than the
Belgian second division, which he had played for (e.g., Peter Ndlovu, Benjani Mwaruwari,
Norman Mapeza etc). Therefore, those who question Moses Chunga’s brilliance point out
that he never managed to play for Europe’s elite leagues.

Chunga is also revered for being a midfielder who managed to score a record 46 goals in a single
season, a record that has stood ever since; for being a dead ball specialist who could even
score from corner kicks, an exceptionally good passer of the ball, and a dribbling wizard. For
example, it is widely rumored that he once dribbled and bamboozled a defender to the point
where he back peddled and twisted his knee causing a career ending injury. As a crowd puller, it
appears Moses Chunga sometimes enjoyed playing to the gallery, which included standing on
the ball.



Sunday Marimo, the former Zimbabwe National Team coach, who led Zimbabwe to its first
appearance at the African Cup Nations final in 2006, admitted that Zimbabwe “lacks a
natural ball player, a playmaker in the mould of Moses Chunga”.



Chunga’s professional career fizzled out within less than 5 years in Belgium, possibly
because of a knee-injury. He tried his luck with his former team Dynamos after quitting his
Belgian team, but it never really worked out well for him on the field, forcing him to retire
from playing. He then began his coaching career, which has produced mixed results, but which
most football followers in Zimbabwe would consider an utter failure.



For all his brilliance on the football field, it appears Moses Chunga had some major flaws in
his personality. It is widely believed, for example, that he refused to play for the Zimbabwe
National Team during his days in Belgium as they were offering him “peanuts”. This is
difficult to verify. However, what can be said with certainty is that he is an assertive
character, which does not seem a common trait in the cultural environs of Zimbabwe.
Therefore, people may struggle to understand or accept him.



Moses Chunga's legendary status was not misplaced as he truly was a genius with a ball,
although he did like to take the mickey out of other players on the football field. He arguably
rivals people like David Beckham as a dead ball specialist. He was however stubborn to the
point of obstinacy which is why some national coaches could not work with him and left him out of
the Zimbabwe national teams (especially the European coaches). Most local coaches however
bowed to popular pressure and named him in their squads.



Chunga had an elder brother, Kembo, who also played for Dynamos.

PETER NDLOVU 100 GREATEST ZIMBABWEANS

Peter Ndlovu was originally spotted by John Sillett, prior to his official signing from
Highlanders by Terry Butcher in July 1991. He made an immediate impact by scoring away at
Arsenal and then became the toast of Highfield Road with a thunderbolt winner against Aston
Villa in November 1991, endearing him to the Sky Blues fans.





Although he would go on to play a major role at several clubs in the second tier, his time at
Coventry will always stand out due to its top flight status. He would play a significant role in
two major teams, Bobby Gould's attacking team of the early 90s and Ron Atkinson-Gordon
Strachan's expansive squad of the mid-late 1990s.

Bobby Gould's team in 1992/93 must surely go down as the archetypal under-achievers. Having
acquired the legendary striker Micky Quinn in November 1992 they continued what had already
been a blistering start, with away wins at Tottenham Hotspur (2-0) Sheffield Wednesday (2-1)
and Wimbledon (2-1) to add to already impressive home wins against the likes of Middlesbrough
(2-1). By the early autumn the Sky Blues briefly topped the inaugural Premier league and would
only lose five league games prior to Christmas. The addition of Micky Quinn to the squad led to
further outstanding home wins against the likes of Aston Villa (3-0) and Liverpool (5-1).
They would eventually go to Championship contenders Blackburn Rovers and leave with a (5-2)
victory in February 1993. However, a barren March/April programme and a run in that would see
back to back games against Man Utd, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leeds Utd saw them slip from 5th in
the league in February to 15th by the end of May. A league position secured with a thrilling
performance from Ndlovu in a last day 3-3 draw against Leeds Utd. Ndlovu was a key component
throughout the season in Gould's fast pacey front line which included John Williams, Kevin
Gallacher (until his departure to Blackburn) and Robert Rosario, who formed a worthy
partnership with Micky Quinn. Peter Ndlovu's goal against Norwich City, in a 1-1 draw in late
September, was a signature piece of Ndlovu flare which earned him the Match of Day 'Goal of the
month' competition.[1]



The 1993/94 season would see a managerial shift in the autumn as Phil Neal, Bobby Gould's No.2,
took over the reins from his passionate Coventry born boss but not before the legendary
curtain raiser to the 93-94 season. Bobby Gould's first day gamble would be to play without
traditional full backs. This novel formation gave Peter Ndlovu full licence to play a large
part in a memorable opening day triumph in the capital. The 3-0 victory on a sunny 14 August,
against double-cup winners Arsenal, saw Micky Quinn score a hat-trick in front of the newly
refurbished North Bank. It also ensured that the Sky Blues made one of their customary
lightning starts to the season, so synonymous of the early 1990s. After an early Ian Wright
threat on the Coventry goal, it was Ndlovu who made a darting run into the Arsenal penalty box
which produced a clumsy challenge from Lee Dixon. The resulting penalty was calmly converted
by Micky Quinn for the opener. The second half would see Ndlovu and Roy Wegerle lead the Gunners
defence a merry dance-Wegerle in particular enjoying possibly his finest game for the club.
So shocked were Arsenal by the 3-0 defeat that manager George Graham cancelled the proposed
post-match lap of honour at the final whistle, which was to parade their Coca Cola and FA Cup
silverware. The explanation given by Arsenal was 'Reasons beyond the club's control!'. It is
thought the Sky Blues turned down a then-massive £4 million offer from Arsenal at the end of
the same 1994 season for Ndlovu's services. The dramatic resignation of Bobby Gould, after a
5-1 mauling at Loftus Road in October 1993, was reputedly inspired by the possible imminent
sale of Ndlovu to a top six club. However, Ndlovu stayed but the 11th place finish secured that
season was not repeated in the 94-95 campaign. Phil Neal was replaced by Ron Atkinson. Big Ron
saved the club from relegation in the spring of 1995 whilst also bringing in Gordon Strachan as
his player-coach No.2.



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/Swmf2SW5YwI/AAAAAAAAAG4/v8eUTOqgweQ/s400/peter++ndlovu.jpg



This second significant phase for Ndlovu would once again promise much; the 'new era' of big
money signings heralded by Atkinson's appointment saw the arrival of Huckerby, Whelan,
Salako and McAllister together with earlier signing Dion Dublin. Big Ron provided vital
impetus in the spring of 95, but the following season his stylish and classy team sheet rarely
'clicked' in the traditional sense. However, Ndlovu scored some memorable goals for the Sky
Blues during this period, including the first away player to secure a hatrick at Anfield for 30
years. Other memorable goals in Sky Blue included a vital winning goal away at Wimbledon in a
relegation six-pointer and a dynamic last minute rifling winner in a 3rd Round FA Cup tie at
West Bromwich Albion.



Ndlovu gradually suffered due to inconsistency. The large and expansive side Gordon
Strachan inherited, well equipped with attacking options, saw fierce competition for
places from the likes of Whelan, Huckerby, Salako and Telfer. An increasingly cosmopolitan
Premier league too would eventually see Coventry turn to the likes of Steve Froggatt and
Moroccan internationals Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo in the years following Ndlovu's
departure. However, if a 'Best Of' goals compilation were ever undertaken by Coventry City,
focusing on their top flight era, then Peter Ndlovu's name would figure prominently. He was
known as 'Nuddy' by the die hard Coventry City fans in Highfield Road's 'West End' and as 'The
'Bulawayo Bullet' by the media of the day. A likeable and mischievous character off the pitch,
Peter Ndlovu is well placed in the top flight Coventry City goalscorers table with a return of
41 goals. The 'Gould-Neal' and 'Atkinson-Strachan' tenures in the Premiership remain some
of Coventry City's most exciting-and indeed frustrating-spells in top flight football.
