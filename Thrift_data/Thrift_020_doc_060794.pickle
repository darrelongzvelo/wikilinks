In \nnineteen-fifties\nBritain there were one million motorcyclists and only four million cars. Most of the latter\nwere driven by ex two-wheelers. Bob Foster (who rallied a Javelin), Geoff Duke,\n          <a href="http://www.motorsportshalloffame.com/halloffame/1996/John_Surtees_main.htm" shape="rect">John Surtees</a>\n          ,  Mike Hailwood, \nPhil Read, Barry Sheene - they were household\nnames for us all, much more so than the racing car drivers. And the camaraderie! If you\nbroke down (as sometimes happened - they were\n          <b>British</b>\n          bikes we rode after all) the\nnext bike would always stop.

From 1956-1960 John was the outstanding \nrider of the day, taking his seven World Championship titles on 350cc and 500cc \nmachines. In 1960 he raced a Ken Tyrrell Cooper car at Goodwood - and won. John \nmade his Grand Prix debut in 1960 for Team Lotus, and in 1964 he won the Formula \n1 World Championship driving for Ferrari. In total John drove in 111 Grands \nPrix, scoring a total of six wins, eight pole positions and eleven fastest laps.\n      </p>\n      <div align="center">\n        <center>\n          <table width="80%" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4" bordercolor="#0000ff" border="2" style="border-collapse: collapse;" id="table2">\n            <tbody>\n              <tr>\n                <td width="47%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">\n                  <img width="290" height="241" border="0" src="surteesyoung4.jpg"></img>\n                </td>\n                <td width="53%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">\n                  <font face="Verdana">\n                    <b>\n                      <i>John Surtees in motorcycle leathers, taken around the time he was a Jupiter owner.\xc2\xa0</i>\n                    </b>\n                  </font>\n                  <p>\n                    <font face="Verdana">\n                      <b>\n                        <i>He remembers the car with great affection. </i>\n                      </b>\n                    </font>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <font face="Verdana">\n                      <b>\n                        <i>A saloon-bodied Jupiter resides in his collection today - see below.</i>\n                      </b>\n                    </font>\n                  </p>\n                </td>\n              </tr>\n            </tbody>\n          </table>\n        </center>\n      </div>\n      <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;">\n        <font size="3">\n          Surtees\' first car \n(after taking his driving test in his mother\'s Morris Minor which ran out of \npetrol during the test) came about as follows &quot;\n          <b>\n            <i>When I was travelling backwards and forwards to Stevenage </i>\n            [serving his apprenticeship at Vincent-HRD]\n            <i> one particularly foul day I stopped at a garage in Hatfield and saw </i>\n          </b>\n        </font>\n        <i>\n          <b>this lovely gold Jupiter in a showroom and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist it</b>\n        </i>\n        <font size="3">\n          <b>\n            <i>.

Born in Tatsfield, Surrey, \n  Surtees won seven world titles in motorcycle racing, winning the 350cc \n  championship from 1958 to 1960, and the 500cc title four times, in 1956 and \n  1958, 1959 and 1960. Surtees then switched to cars full time in 1960 making \n  his Formula 1 debut with Lotus in the Monaco GP that year. He then moved to \n  Ferrari and won the world F1 title for them in 1964.\n        </p>\n        <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;">\n          In recent times\n          <b>John</b>\n          <b>Surtees</b>\n          added a special bodied Jupiter\n    (by\n          <strong>Coachcraft of Egham</strong>\n          ) to his collection of two and\n    four-wheelers, and here I have scanned in a couple of pictures of this handsome vehicle for your\n    delight.
