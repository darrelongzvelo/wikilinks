What IS a Geode?



My sister had a brilliant idea today. We’ve been noticing not everyone knows what a geode is
or how exactly to pronounce it. We also noticed that many people do know what they are, they just
don’t know they know what they are. The idea was to post about what geodes actually are to help
people see where this project has evolved from. Thanks for the helpÂ  Wikipedia ! (sorry for
the not great quality of the photos, I liked these examples most)

From Wikipedia

Geodes Â ( Greek Â  Î³ÎµÏŽÎŽÎ·Ï‚ – ge-Å�dÄ“s ,
“earthlike”) areÂ  geological Â secondary sedimentary structures which occur
inÂ  sedimentary Â and certainÂ  volcanic Â rocks. Geodes are essentially
spherical masses of mineral matter that were deposited syngenetically within the rock
formations they are found in. Geodes have aÂ  chalcedony Â shell containing various
minerals, usuallyÂ  quartz . Geodes differ fromÂ  vugs Â in that they were formed as a
separate entity from the surrounding rock, whereas vugs are voids or cavities within a rock
formation. Geodes also differ from “nodules” in that a nodule is a mass of mineral matter
that has accreted around the nodule nucleous. Both structures had the minerals contained
within deposited from groundwater or hydrothermal processes. The exterior of most geodes
generally consists of chalcedony, a cryptocrystalline form of quartz. Inside the
chalcedony shell many minerals have been found such asÂ  calcite ,Â  pyrite ,Â 
kaolinite ,Â  sphalerite ,Â  millerite ,Â  barite ,Â  dolomite ,Â  limonite
,Â  smithsonite Â and quartz, which is by far the most common and abundant mineral found
in geodes. Geodes are found mostly inÂ  basaltic Â  lavas Â andÂ  limestones .
TheÂ  Warsaw Formation Â in theÂ  Keokuk Â region near the area where Missouri,
Iowa, and Illinois join contains abundant geodes.

 

Formation



Geodes can form in any cavity, but the term is usually reserved for more or less rounded
formations in igneous and sedimentary rocks, while the more general term “vug” is
applied to cavities in fissures and veins. They can form in gas bubbles inÂ  igneous rocks ,
such as vesicles in basalticÂ  lavas , or as in the AmericanÂ  Midwest , rounded cavities
in sedimentary formations. After rock around the cavity hardens, dissolvedÂ  silicates
Â and/orÂ  carbonates Â are deposited on the inside surface. Over time, this slow
feed of mineral constituents fromÂ  groundwater Â orÂ  hydrothermal Â solutions
allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber. Bedrock containing geodes eventually
weathers and decomposes, leaving them present at the surface if they are composed of
resistant material such as quartz.
