Online Marketing vs. Campagne Pubblicitarie tradizionali





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015391f86bb9970b-320wi Tempo
fa ho affrontato le contraddizioni proposte da una ricerca sulle piccole e medie imprese per
quanto riguarda i social networks e alcune componenti legate al marketing virale al giorno
d'oggi.

Le statistiche  confermano il forte utilizzo di internet e si prevede l'aumento rapido ed
esponenziale dello stesso, a livello globale.

L'incredibile sviluppo della tecnologia, la nascita di varie piattaforme sociali ( Web 2.0 )
e l'avvento del Web of Data ( Web Semantico 3.0 ) sono dei fattori estremamente importanti per
chiunque. 

L'arte di comunicare

Le l eve tradizionali del marketing non ottengono l'effetto desiderato, se utilizzate nella
sfera virtuale. E' necessario sottolineare che, per alcuni decenni l'ossessiva supremazia
della pubblicitÃ  unilaterale, da molti indesiderata e veicolata tramite i media
tradizionali ( TV, Giornali, Radio, etc .) ha da tempo perso il suo arcano fascino.

Ora, tutti hanno ri-guadagnato la propria voce. Ognuno ha la possibilitÃ  di interagire
con chiunque, aziende o persone. Fondamentalmente, si tratta sempre di comunicazione.

L'errore piÃ¹ profuso Ãš quello, per l'appunto, di applicare strategie e tattiche del
marketing tradizionale nel mondo virtuale. Spingere la propria offerta di prodotti o
servizi con un accento tipicamente pubblicitario Ãš considerato altamente
controproduttivo dalle comunitÃ  online.



Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015391f8b93f970b-320wi

Sorge spontaneo pensare al Direct Marketing. Nella piccola Svizzera, ad esempio, piÃ¹ del
55% della popolazione (sottoscritto compreso) ha apposto un adesivo sulla buca da lettere
con la dicitura: NO PubblicitÃ , Grazie!



Viviamo in un'era dove il tempo Ãš diventato un privilegio. Un'era dove siamo molto piÃ¹
informati, molto piÃ¹ selettivi e - soprattutto - stanchi di essere bombardati da
pubblicitÃ  che non ci servono e che interrompono le nostre attivitÃ  giornaliere, alla
stregua dello spam.

Il mondo virtuale

Banner Ads, Pop-Ups, Tweets inviati senza alcun ritegno dalle aziende ai bloggers piÃ¹
influenti per farsi conoscere, Fan-Pages in Facebook dove le aziende "taggano" le persone
senza il loro permesso per fare della pubblicitÃ ... Insomma, si assiste a qualsiasi
sortilegio per attirare un po' di attenzione.

Gli esperti del settore, cosÃ¬ come la gente comune, condannano questo tipo di
atteggiamento. Attrarre non significa interrompere, nÃ© tantomeno spingere il proprio
prodotto e/o servizio sino all'esasperazione. 

In aggiunta, ognuno di noi, in qualitÃ  di consumatori si rivolge ai motori di ricerca per
qualsiasi tipo di necessitÃ . Una ricerca? Un prodotto particolare? Un servizio?
Semplice divertimento? Informazioni? Educazione? Vacanze? Business?



Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c014e8becad15970d-320wi
L'ostacolo piÃ¹ grande risiede nel generare " traffico " al proprio sito web, vera e propria
" frontline " dell'azienda, o organizzazione. A tal riguardo ci sono molte strategie
incentrate sull'ottimizzazione della propria piattaforma nei confronti dei motori di
ricerca.



Nondimeno, quantitÃ  non equivale a qualitÃ . In prospettiva, sicuramente piÃ¹
allettante un (potenziale) cliente interessato a quanto si offre ed a relazione stabile e
duratura piuttosto che una moltitudine di contatti che non servono praticamente a nulla.

La sfera online offre una grandiosa possibilitÃ : l'interazione. Non Ãš dunque di buon
auspicio interrompere le persone oppure inondarle di spam. Interazione significa scambio
di comune accordo e reciprocitÃ . Non dimentichiamo che una delle " leggi della
persuasione " di uno dei massimi esperti in materia, il Dr. Cialdini, Ãš proprio basata
sulla reciprocitÃ .

Per quanto concerne il marketing online sono convinto del fatto che la spiegazione offerta
dallo stratega David Meerman Scott sia la piÃ¹ accreditata per spiegare, in poche parole,
il marketing digitale:

Non Ãš piÃ¹ necessario spendere grosse somme del budget aziendale per conquistare
l'attenzione della gente ( PubblicitÃ  ), neppure pregare per un po' di attenzione dai mass
media ( Pubbliche Relazioni ) e neanche irritare una persona alla volta, per ottenere
l'attenzione desiderata ( Vendite e Vendita personale ).

Oggigiorno, Ãš di vitale importanza guadagnarsi l'attenzione desiderata. CiÃ²
risulta possibile creando contenuti interessanti e degni di nota che altri considerano
preziosi e di valore, e quindi condividono. La sfera virtuale offre poi la possibilitÃ  di
divulgare gli stessi in modo totalmente gratuito ( Blogs, YouTube, e-Books, Rapporti, etc.
).

CiÃ² non accade entro le tempistiche di una tradizionale campagna pubblicitaria. La
comunicazione Ãš continuativa, Ãš uno sforzo per taluni non indifferente ma che alla
fine porterÃ  i frutti ricercati.

"While technologies for each form of online content are a little different, the one common
aspect is that through all of these media, your organization can exercise thought leadership
rather than simple advertising and product promotion"

(David Meerman Scott, The New Rules of Marketing and PR)

Human Resources love Quizzes





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015391f29ee2970b-320wi
Ability is considered as being an individual's capacity to perform some task. A person's
overall abilities contains two distinct sets of factors: intellectual & physical
abilities .

Physical ability relates to the capacity to perform tasks demanding power, stamina,
strenght and characteristics alike, whereas intellectual abilites might be defined in
various ways with regards to our mental processes.

HR Dept. love Quizzes

Intelligence Quotient (IQ) , for instance, is often cited as a method for assessing a person's
intelligence on the basis of several standardized tests; whereas the Emotional
Intelligence (EI) is more concerned with the set of mental abilities related to emotions and
the processing of emotional information that contribute to logical thought and
intelligence, in general.

The frequently mentioned dimensions of the standardized tests usually are: number
aptitude, verbal comprhension, perceptual speed, inductive and deductive reasoning,
spatial visualization and memory .

Multiple intelligence, on the other hand, considers a broader range of subparts: cognitive,
social, emotional and cultural.

Many believe that results are a prediction of good or bad performance,  a mirror of either job
and life fit and how you cope with any challenge. These standardized tests are often used by
Human Resource (HR) Departments and widely taught in Universities at Bachelor and Master
Degrees levels worldwide.

To my personal opinion these tests might give cues on how the person is but their validity shall
be questioned seeing that, eventually, a "psycho-test" cannot stand a comparison with the
real-life hands-on performance.

Learning occurs throughout the entire life

Researches space from Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov 's findings on the stimulus -
response classical conditioning to the operant conditioning theory by Harvard Professor 
Burrhus F. Skinner , who argued that behavior is a function of its consequences on a
reinforcement/punishment basis; to social learning , by observing other people or being
told about something.

It has to be taken into consideration that we are a needy species and we are innately curious
through our developmental stages, throughout our lives. We are born with a predisposition to
learn and it is argued that each of us can learn to perform any task. 

As obvious as it might be, we can all learn to play tennis but we probably won't beat Roger
Federer in a competition. The same goes for everything else, from sports to classical music
and so on.

American Psychologist and researcher A. Maslow discovered that we all go through a 4-steps
process in order to gain competency and mastery :

1. Unconscious Incompetence

We do not even know that we are ignorant about something.

2. Conscious Incompetence

We become aware that we do not know a thing about something.

3. Conscious competence

We are learning and we become effective in that something.

4. Unconscious Competence

We are no longer aware on how we do something, we master it and perform naturally.

The funny thing is that we then have difficulties in teaching others how we do that something.
If asked to we'd need to go through a fifth step, rediscovering the "how-to".





"Knowledge is gained by learning; trust by doubt; skill by practice; and love by love"

(Thomas Stephen Szasz)

Are You Charismatic?





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c014e8bdff711970d-320wi It is
impossible not to communicate. We do it all the time. Studies demonstrate that  55% of the
meaning of communication is body language , 38% is in tonality , and 7% rests in the words
themselves.

This shows the need of paying attention to the whole body for effective communication, either
in our business and private lives.

We do often hear about charisma and charismatic people. Napoleon Bonaparte ,  Winston
Churchill ,  Martin Luther King ,  Adolf Hitler ,  Bill Clinton  and others have all been
portrayed as possessing charismatic qualities.

Charismatic traits

    Researches find charismatic people as having an infectuous personality. Their
    personality traits induce others to follow them, to copy their body language and even to
    mime their facial expressions. Documented studies isolated 5 main characteristics of
    charismatic leaders :

    - They have a vision.

    

    - They are willing to take risks to achieve the vision.

    

    - They are sensitive to the environmental constraints.

    

    - They are sensitive to followers needs.

    

    - They display behaviors out of the ordinary.

    



Charismatic people have optimistic views, passion and they might be considered a catalyst
for generating enthusiasm and fervour. They master the art of communication and enhance
either the followers' Self-esteem and Self-confidence.

Leaders cannot exist without followers, and viceversa. 

Never ever make people wrong

Sharing secrets of personal magnetism,  Kevin Hogan  & Mary Lee Labay  say that the secret
of charisma is to feel good being around someone. Being drawn to someone like a magnet.
Needless to highlight again, one characteristic of charismatic leaders is to make others
feel well about themselves and being sensitive to their followers needs.

This is to be considered vital in any business setting, presentation, interpersonal
relationship or even a romantic conversation. After all, we live in a world where it is not
possible not to communicate, don't we?

    As simple as it might be, Kevin and Mary's formula is to know what is important to people and
    to help them being right, even if they are wrong , because when you make others feel bad in
    your presence you are considered as not being attractive and negative feelings might be
    associated with you. To this regard their research uncovered 8 deadly sins of
    unattractive communication , the following:

    1 - The Argumentative Communicator:  I n a conversation, i f you keep taking opposite
    views, you end up destroying rapport. You make others feel wrong, silly, not informed.
    This will generate negative feelings about you.

    

    2 - The Comparison Maker: If you keep comparing what others have to say to your personal
    experiences you are not really listening, you will be perceived as not being really
    interested in what others have to say.

    

    3 - The "Better Than" Talker: You'd be quite similar to the Comparison Maker but with the
    perceived intent of creating superiority in a dialogue.

    

    4 - The "Hear My Old Baggage" Communicator:  Are you begging for Self-pity? In other
    people's eyes you are just  showing despair, sadness and pessimism.

    

    5 - The Judgmental Communicator:  The need of judging others shows lack of
    Self-confidence.

    

    6 - The Interrupting Communicator: It is absolutely not nice to interrupt people all the
    time.

    

    7 - The Complaining Communicator: Same traits as the " Old Baggage " communicator. You are
    carrying around negative feelings. Others do not need your nonstop complaints.

    

    8 - The Gossiping Communicator: It is very tempting to Gossip around. Do not do it. It shows
    low Self-esteem seeing that you are perceived as needy to find faults in other people (&
    living in some small world of yours).

    



One of the keys to effective communication lies in active listening, communicating with our
whole bodies and a mutual disclosure that is respected and welcomed.

if you want to be perceived as charismatic and make others feel well when around you, do your
very best to avoid the 8 deadly traps of unattractive communication.

"The way we communicate with others and with ourselves ultimately determines the quality of
our lives"

(Anthony Robbins)

The map is not the territory





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015391e674b2970b-320wi

Cognitive psychology is a subdiscipline of psychology. The term cognition derives from
the Latin word " Cognoscere " ( to know, to conceptualize ). This branch of
psychology investigates internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and
language. In few words, information processing, knowledge and human thinking.

As psychology disciplines proliferated throughout the twentieth century, many theories
and models were offered suggesting numerous approaches about the mind and the human brain's
internal processes.

In 1890,  Wilhelm M. Wundt , one of the founding figures of modern psychology, specified
the "senses", or the "sensory system", as being the components of "thought".

Later on,  Alfred Korzybski , the developer of the theory of  General Semantics  (1933)
and in the 1970's,  John Grinder and Richard Bandler , made it possible to turn these findings
into a brand new field of study: Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP).
Then Neuro-Semantics (NS) was given birth by Michael L. Hall .

Either NLP & NS accept the macro-level of the "senses" as the components of human being's
thinking.

Information processing

We all know that, in our mind-body dichotomy, we have the power to gather and process
information. We might infer that our brains work like a computer.

However, we were not born with a software or hardware inside our heads. Initially, our brain
needs to Self-program itself until we are able to develop a constancy of representation.

We see, we hear, we feel. We represent things in our minds and we construct maps to help us
navigate into the world. Thinking itself creates information and vice versa.

The VAKOG model

The only way that we have, as human beings, to perceive the external world is through our
senses. The various senses play their role as information processors and are also known as 
representation systems , or  sensory modalities .

The name of the model comes from the initial letters of the sensory-specific modalities:
Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Olfactory, Gustatory. 

It is argued that outside our neurology there are energy forces from which we pick up clues,
data and information with the help of our senses.

We then create our maps of the world.

Either NLP and NS agree on the fact that the images, sounds and feelings in our minds (and
bodies) affect us and that there are many ways to change our sensory maps. However, both
disciplines differ quite a lot in their teachings, from terminology to strategy.

One important premise is considered as being the foundation of the relationship between an
object and the representation of the object itself. Our abstracted representation of
reality differs from reality itself.

"The map is not the territory"

(Alfred Korzybski)

Give Me Your Eyes That I Might See





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015435b3fba7970c-320wi
Leonardo Da Vinci  believed that the eyes are the window of the soul. Leading experts are
still trying to discover what the  Mona Lisa is conveying with her enigmatic eyes.

Others believe that body language is a window to our minds.

Understanding Eye Movement

There is a great deal of research into understanding eye movements with regards to the
fascinating relationship with our internal representations.

Original research begun early in the 1950's.  Ernest Hilgard distinguished himself
through his studies of the role of hypnosis in human behavior and response-ability. He was
interested in how eye movements related to behavior and he did extensive research with the
human eye lid.

In the 1970's  Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP)  co-founders,  John Grinder  and 
Richard Bandler  did further research to explore the relationship between eye movements
and the different sensory modalities, as well as other different cognitive processes.

    Within NLP, the various senses are considered as being information processors, and are
    known as  sensory modalities . This includes our sensory-specific modalities:

    - Visual               (sight, images)

    

    - Auditory          (sounds, speech, dialogue)

    

    - Kinesthetic       (feelings, emotions)

    

    - Olfactory         (smell)

    

    - Gustatory        (taste)

    



Eye accessing cues



Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015435b423f5970c-320wi As
pointed out and agreed by many, eye movements as indicators of cognitive processes is one of
the most well known and valuable discovery of NLP. 

Eyes may or may not be the windows to our souls but they are surely inter-related with our
emotions, feelings and responses. It is argued that the eyes do not lie and reveal a great deal
of information about what is happening inside our bodies and minds.

For instance, as far as eye movements are concerned, research tells us that:

    LOOKING TO THE RIGHT

    - UP (Visually Constructed = constructing images, something never seen)

    

    - LEVEL (Auditory Constructed = constructing sound and/or words, never heard before)

    

    - DOWN (Kinesthetic feelings = sensing inner past or future feelings)

    



    LOOKING TO THE LEFT

    - UP (Visually Remembered = seen before, remembering)

    

    - LEVEL (Auditory Remembered = sounds and/or words from the past, remembering)

    

    - DOWN (Auditory digital = internal dialogue, self talk)

    



Eye movement cues can be easily observed. These movements might be habitual but, for sure, are
a part of our body language that cannot be consciously controlled by our minds.

This gives important cues on a person's preferred sensory modality system and can be a
detector for either truth, or deception.

 "The eyes are the mirror of the soul"

(Yiddish Proverb)

Where is my Mind?





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015435a54463970c-320wi The
brain is considered as being the center of the nervous system, either in vertebrate and most
invertebrate animals.

It is argued that evolution took part in adapting brains to particular environmental
conditions. This means that, to a certain degree, the brain has evolved over time in order to
face new circumstances  and solve problems related to our changing needs.

It is fascinating that this vital organ, that has been at the center of debates for centuries,
is still magically "unknown" in its processes. Mysteriously charming.

Healing methods of the past

Evidence from Neolithic remains from around the globe shows clear signs of holes of a smooth
edge pattern in some skulls.  Trepanning  is a surgical intervention which consists in
drilling or scraping a hole into the human skull to expose the Dura mater  for healing
purposes and was practiced widely until relatively recent times in many cultures.  The main
question could be, what exactly they were trying to heal? Mind, body, soul?

Theoretical arguments in favor of the modern techniques of  Electro-convulsive Therepies
(ECT) , also known as electroshock, have not been stronger than Trepanning, with regards to
healing purposes. 

Is the brain the vehicle of our minds?

Homer was the most important and  earliest  of the Greek and Roman writers. He is considered
the writer of the  Iliad , which is among the oldest substantial works of Western
literature and, possibly another work ascribed to him, the  Odyssey . The lliad recounts the
siege of Troy and its (in part) sequel tells the journey back home of Ulysses.

Astonishingly,  in these masterpieces, Homer's vocabulary makes absolute no reference
to words suggesting any mental terms such as thought, behavior, decision making, belief,
doubt or introspection. Furthermore,  these master works tell us that at that point in time
(8th century B.C.) feelings and emotions were believed to be located in some parts of the body
(e.g. heart or, often, the midriff).

Years later, literate Greeks at the time of Plato and Aristotle  created a metaphorical
space where to house thinking, intention and desires: the psyche . Now known as Mind.

Where is my Mind?

There is no simple answer to this question. The concept of mind is understood in many ways by
different traditions, schools of thought and various disciplines.

In history, many brilliant thinkers like  Hippocrates , Plato , Aristotle , Galen  up to
Copernicus , Galilei and Da Vinci  tried to explain the relationship between mind, brain and
body.

However, it was not until the early 19th century that theories started to be focused on the fact
that the brain is the organ of the mind and that different mental and moral faculties could be
localized in particular cortical regions, by neuro anatomists  Gall  and  Spurzheim .



Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015391d5ca57970b-320wi

This, as a reaction to phrenology , led to the study of cortical localization by other famous
neuro explorers (e.g. Flourens , Fritsch , Hitzig ); leading to several discoveries related
to languaging disorders.

Nowadays, the primary goal of neuropsychology is to use detailed behavioral analyses to make
inferences with regards to the underlying structure and functional properties of this vital
organ. At the same time, clinical neuropsychology is concerned in examining and explaining
particular patterns of disorders in human behavior, that might arise from disruption in
brain processes.

However, we might argue that the elaborate developments in the medicine field do not offer a
satisfying answer in terms of the relationship between mind and brain and its processes. This
means that there is still no scientific evidence outside other disciplines (e.g.
philosophy, religions, etc.) 

Late discoveries

At the  Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL)  researchers are
trying to integrate knowledge gained by multidisciplinary approaches across different
disciplines to understand the fundamental principles of brain function by using and
developing unique experimental, theoretical, technological and computational
approaches. 

It has been reported to The Journal of Neuroscience that the  Digital Holographic
Microscopy (DHM)  can now be used to observe neuronal activity in real-time and in three
dimensionsâ€”with up to 50 times greater resolution than ever before. Great
advancements.

But... Where is my Mind?

Semantic Web Tech: Linking Data Open Cloud # overview





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c014e8bbe8160970d-320wi

Linked data is about connecting data. It is about linking data that was not previously linked
in the web sphere or lower any barriers to linking current data, using other methods.

Linking Data is a  W3C  project of the  Semantic Web Education and Outreach (SWEO)
 interest group, or task force.

This brings together the movement to open Data with the Linked Data principles for publishing
Data  by making Data public and freely accessible. Its progress is documented with the use of
the Cloud, as shown in the picture.

Linking Open Data Cloud

    For instance,  DBpedia   is a community effort to extract structured content
    from  Wikipedia  (covering resources from all domains) and to make this
    information available on the Web by publishing it as Linked Data.

    - It provides a rich source for interlinking by providing common URI's (for real and
    fictional worlds).

    

    - Sparql endpoints are provided.

    

    - OWL ontologies contain more than 200 Classes and more than 1000 Properties defined by
    DBpedia metadata.

    

    - Other Classes & Properties are re-used when appropriate.

    

    - Interlinkage is with several datasets ( e.g. Geonames, the NewYork Times & Music Brainz
    ).

    



Geonames

Geonames   is a geographical database that covers all countries and contains over eight
million placenames that are available for download, free of charge. It provides a rich source
for interlinking by providing URIs for geographical areas and any point of interest.

NewYork Times

The popular  NewYork Times  published their subject index catalogue  under a  Creative
Commons  attribution 3.0 license. This provides a rich source for interlinking by
providing URIs for Subjects used regularly in tagging human language articles.

Music Brainz

MusicBrainz  is an open music encyclopedia that collects, and makes available to the
public, music metadata information and provides a rich source for interlinking by providing

quoted in Wikipedia, the basic idea is  that certain Data should be freely available to
everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright,
patents or other mechanisms of control.

Since its starting debut in year 2007 the diagram has grown and the datasets in the cloud
consist of over 30 bn. Triples and interlinked by 504 mio. RDF links.

Growing.

Semantic Web Tech: Linked Data consumption # overview





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015391c46757970b-320wi
Having had a look at  Linked Data Publishing   it goes without saying that one shall turn to
its consumption, as well.

Linked data consumption follows a couple of strategies that are pretty much comparable to the
current Web, with some additional advantages.

In fact, Linked Data browsing exploits best practices and interlinkages to offer guidance to
the human reader. Moreover, Linked Data search exploits the semantics to improve searches
over the Web and, lastly datasets are mashed-up together to create new applications.

Traditional vs. Linked Data browsers

Traditional Web browsers render pre-existing documents and display them to their fixed HTML
representation, providing navigation according to pre-existing hyperlinks in documents.
On the other side of the coin, Linked Data browsers render resources according to HTML as the
traditional Web plus representation of RDF terms, such as, for instance: rdfs:label,
rdfs:comment, foaf:depiction . 

Linked Data browsers may use the understanding of Predicates and Classes to display
information about Subjects in a more flexible and meaningful way; allowing navigation to
related datasets, even if not nominated by the publisher.

Examples

The  Tabulator Linked Data browser  is an extension of the Firefox browser with views for
maps, timelines, calendars, etc. and a mechanism for extension to other views, based on RDF
Classes & Predicates.

The Marbles application  is a a server-side application that formats Semantic Web content
for XHTML clients that aggregates Linked DAta about nominated resources. It uses colored
dots ("marbles") to illustrate the origin of an item and allows navigation between different
datasets. For instance,  Marbles provides display and database capabilities for 
DBpedia Mobile .

Differences in Data search

    The Traditional Web search

    - is keyword based

    

    - crawls documents via hyperlinks

    

    - judges popularity by using hyperlinks

    

    - stores documents as bags of words

    

    - presents the results as a set of links

    



    The Semantic Web search

    - crawls documents via interlinks as described in RDF graph-like structures

    

    - integrates information about unambiguous resources

    

    - uses inference to find matches and interprets queries in a general way

    

    - presents results in a coherent and meaningful fashion, intelligently

    



For instance,  Sig.ma  is a data aggregator for the Semantic Web, it allows keyword based
searches and presents aggregated results from many sources, using  Sindice , in style of
Linked Data browsing, in order to present an integrated view.

Furthermore, as another interesting example, search engine nr. #1  Google  is
increasingly using Semantic annotations in order to improve on traditional search results
on the Web.

In conclusion, there are further strategies known from Web 2.0 to building an application
which aggregates Linked Data. However, significant effort is still needed to achieve
reusable visualization an results of Linked Data.

Parisienne Promotion: Green Pack vs. Red Site





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c015391bdfa4b970b-320wi A
couple of days ago I received a nice little pack at home. By opening it, I found out that it was a
promotional gift (a new cigarette pack) from  Parisienne , one of the most popular
cigarette brands in Switzerland.

Green news

The little information booklet sent along with the gift highlights the idea that it is a matter
of taste, by pointing out the perfect tobacco blending and underlining the fact that new
packages are made without using cellophane, additives & aluminium foil. Great news: Eco
Friendly.

Interesting but..

The booklet is in German. Admittedly, my German knowledge is just scholastic, hence not so
proficient as I'd wish.

For this particular reason, being quite curious with regards to this promo, yesterday
evening I went online in order to get some more information ( most Swiss websites offer the
three main National languages ).

The online dilemma

The company's website  front page is nice and welcomes you in German , French and Italian .
However, you need either to be registered or to register. Presumably, I thought, it is built in
this way in order not to offer access to people under 18. This should be related to the fact that,
in Switzerland, there are several restrictions dictated by laws when it comes to sales and
promotion activities of tobacco.

Fair enough. Although I do not like to give out my personal data to enter a site, I decide to go on
and submit my private details such as address, nationality, birth date, mobile phone and so
on.

3/5

    On the third "data-submission page" I discover that access to the website is allowed only
    to people over 18 (as I supposed) and I am given three choices to continue :

    - Swiss ID Card (on the page Credit Card is mentioned as well, but I guess it is a mistake)

    

    - Swiss Passport Number

    

    - Manual procedure

    





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c014e8bb1dd83970d-320wi

The funny thing is that the first two alternatives are temporarily unavailable .

As a consequence, the only choice I'd have in order to enter the website is to send a scanned copy
of my document by e-mail or to fill in some documents to send by post mail .

What?!?!

Studies and researches demonstrate that people are impatient, busy and eager to click, If you
do not offer the right thing to click " on the now " people will just leave your site by hitting the
back button .

In this particular instance I did not behave differently and just left the site. It would be a
good idea for Parisienne's marketing team to review their online marketing strategies to see
if there is an alternative to force registering.

  Or, at least, to quickly fix the " out of service " alternatives in their website's third
page.

Semantic Web Tech: Linked Data publishing # overview





Image:
http://actualizink.typepad.com/.a/6a015432d72bcf970c0154358bc0db970c-320wi As far
as  Linked Data  is concerned there are several popular means to publish it.

Host RDF/XML as static files

The easiest way to create simple Linked Data content is to host a hand-edited file on the web
server.  Clearly, the web server should be configured to accept different content types
(e.g. Html, RDF/XML, N3 or Turtle) seeing that it would be messy to offer alternative
serialisation that would cause useless duplications.

Include RDFa in HTML generated from existing Content Management Systems (CMS)

Some argue that this method could be minimally invasive to augment a existing web system. For
instance, web servers would need minimal configuration, some generic CMS and other
e-Commerce solutions already include RDFa support and some other technical features might
be considered as being optional.

Publishing direct from Triple store

It is also suggested to follow principles and best practices for large datasets and to store
data in RDF format in a dedicated database, a triple store. This would lead to a number of
advantages seeing that most triplestores allow HTTP negotiations in terms of
serialisation, allow direct processing of Sparql queries and implicitly support - with
respect to retrieving data via a URI - resource deferencing via DESCRIBE queries.

Arguably, this is a great solution for hosting new datasets but in a number of cases there is
already a infrastructure which cannot be (easily) replaced.

Exposing relational database via translation

Many large databases are managed using relational Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) to
expose existing relational data as Linked Data. For example D2R  server is a tool for
publishing relational databases on the Semantic Web.

Popular vocabularies

    Several vocabularies have become de facto standard in the Linked Data community:

    - The Dublin Core (DC) defines generic metadata terms

    

    - The Friend of a Friend vocabulary describes people and relationships

    

    - The Creative Commons (CC) describes copy right and licensing

    



Other applications (e.g. e-Commerce, Media, etc) also have their standard vocabularies.

Basically, Linked Data's goal is to use the Web to connect related data that was not previously
linked or improve current links using other methods. More specifically, as defined in
Wikipedia, it is a a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and
become more useful.
