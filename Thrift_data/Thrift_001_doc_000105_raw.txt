Knee-Deep in Bluegrass with Cindy Baucom



Posted by Henri Deschamps on November 10, 2011 ·

Knee-Deep in Bluegrass with Cindy Baucom â€¢ A love of Bluegrass was instilled in me early
in life. My father, a Bluegrass musician, frequently had band practices at our home as I was
growing up in the mountains of Ashe County , North Carolina .



"As a child I attended Fiddlers Conventions and Bluegrass Festivals , having the opportunity
to hear some of the best music anywhere. More important, I started building many close
friendships which remain with me today."

My radio career started at the age of 17. Over the years, I have served as Emcee for many top
festivals including Merlefest in Wilkesboro, NC, Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver Bluegrass
Festival in Denton, NC , Bass Mountain Bluegrass Festival in Burlington, NC, IBMA FanFest in
Nashville, and many others. I have been a contributor to Bluegrass Unlimited Magazine as both
a writer and photographer.

"I have loved to sing as long as I can remember. When I was 14, I started playing guitar; shortly
after that, I learned to play acoustic bass. My husband, musician Terry Baucom , has been
working with me on banjo (he is so patient!). I have also performed locally and regionally with
a number of bands."

I am extremely honored to have been named the 2005 Broadcaster of the Year in Nashville by the
International Bluegrass Music Association .

Knee-Deep in Bluegrass with Cindy Baucom is a 2-hour weekly Bluegrass Show, highlighting the
best Bluegrass from new releases to classics. The Knee-Deep Artist Spotlight features an
interview with one of the top entertainers in Bluegrass. The Vintage Vault goes back many
years with one of the pioneering legends of Bluegrass. Nearly 100 radio stations nationwide
air the program each week. Click Here for Station Finder. Click Here for Blog

"I host the syndicated radio show, Knee Deep In Bluegrass, distributed by the John Boy & Billy
Radio Network in Charlotte, North Carolina. I am married to Terry Baucom. I am the mother of
three smart, beautiful, athletic, talented, polite and loving children-Houston, Molly and
Hunter-that I love very much. We have three precious pets-Buzz, Odie and Max. Because Terry
and I both have careers in the music and entertainment business, much of our time is spent at
concerts and festivals. We are truly blessed to be able to make our living doing what we are
passionate about-Bluegrass Music."
