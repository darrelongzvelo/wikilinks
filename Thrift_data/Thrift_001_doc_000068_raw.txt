Early life



Sting was born in Wallsend , Newcastle upon Tyne , England, [3] the eldest of four children born
to Audrey (nÃ©e Cowell), a hairdresser, and Ernest Matthew Sumner, a milkman and engineer.
[4] His siblings were Philip, Angela and Anita. Young Gordon would often assist his father
with the early-morning milk-delivery rounds, and by age 10 he became obsessed with an old
Spanish guitar that had been left behind by an emigrating friend of his father. [5]

He attended St. Cuthbert’s Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne. He would often sneak into
nightclubs like the Club A Go-Go, where he would watch acts such as Cream and Jimi Hendrix ,
artists who would later influence his own music. After jobs as a bus conductor, a construction
labourer, and a tax officer, he attended Northern Counties College of Education, (which
later became part of Northumbria University ) from 1971 to 1974 and qualified as a teacher. [6]
He then worked as a schoolteacher at St. Paul’s First School in Cramlington for two years.
[7]

Sting performed in jazz bands on evenings, weekends, and during breaks from college and from
teaching. He played with local jazz bands such as the Phoenix Jazzmen, the Newcastle Big Band,
and Last Exit . He gained his nickname after he performed wearing a black and yellow sweater
with hooped stripes while onstage with the Phoenix Jazzmen. Bandleader Gordon Solomon [8]
thought that the sweater made him look like a bee, which prompted the nickname “Sting”.
[9] In the 1985 documentary Bring on the Night he was addressed by a journalist as
“Gordon”, and replied: “My children call me Sting, my mother calls me Sting, who is this
Gordon character?” [10] In a 2011 interview for Time magazine, he stated: “I was never
called Gordon. You could shout Gordon in the street and I would just move out of your way.”
[11]

Musical career



The Police

Main article: The Police

In January 1977, Sting moved from Newcastle to London, and soon thereafter he joined Stewart
Copeland and Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers ) to form the New Wave band
The Police . Between 1978 and 1983, they released five chart-topping albums and won six Grammy
Awards . Although their initial sound was punk inspired, The Police soon switched to reggae
-tinged rock and minimalist pop. Their last album, Synchronicity , which included their most
successful song, “ Every Breath You Take “, was released in 1983. According to Sting, who
appeared in the documentary Last Play at Shea , he decided to leave The Police while onstage
during the 18 August 1983 concert at Shea Stadium because he felt that playing that venue was
“ Everest “. [12] While never formally breaking up, after Synchronicity the group agreed
to concentrate on solo projects. As the years went by, the band members, particularly Sting,
dismissed the possibility of reforming. In 2007, however, the band reformed and undertook a
world tour . [13]

Early solo work



In September 1981, Sting made his first live solo appearance, performing on all four nights of
the fourth Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policeman’s Other Ball at the
invitation of producer Martin Lewis . He performed solo versions of “ Roxanne ” and “
Message in a Bottle “. He also led an all-star band (dubbed “The Secret Police”) on his
own arrangement of Bob Dylan ‘s “ I Shall Be Released “. The band and chorus included Eric
Clapton , Jeff Beck , Phil Collins , Bob Geldof and Midge Ure , all of whom except Beck later
worked together on Live Aid . His performances were featured prominently in the album and
movie of the show and drew critical attention to his work. Sting’s participation in The
Secret Policeman’s Other Ball was the beginning of his growing involvement in raising
money and consciousness for political and social causes. In 1982 he released a solo single,
“ Spread a Little Happiness ” from the film version of the Dennis Potter television play
Brimstone and Treacle . The song was a re-interpretation of a song from the 1920s musical Mr.
Cinders by Vivian Ellis , and was a surprise Top 20 hit in the UK. [14]

1980s



His first solo album, 1985′s The Dream of the Blue Turtles , featured a cast of jazz
musicians, including Kenny Kirkland , Darryl Jones , Omar Hakim , and Branford Marsalis . It
included the hit singles “ If You Love Somebody Set Them Free “, (backed with the non-LP
song “Another Day”) “ Fortress Around Your Heart “, “Love Is the Seventh Wave”,
and “ Russians “, the last of which was based on a theme from the Lieutenant KijÃ© Suite .
[15] Within a year, the album reached Triple Platinum . This album would garner Sting a Grammy
nomination for Album of the Year. The film Bring on the Night , directed by Michael Apted ,
documented the formation of the band and its first concert in France.

Sting performing in 1985

Also in 1985, he sang the introduction and chorus to “ Money for Nothing ” by Dire Straits .
Sting was reportedly embarrassed when his publishing company insisted on a co-writing
credit (and royalties) since his “I Want My MTV” line, was sung to exactly the same notes as
the chorus of “Don’t Stand So Close to Me”. He performed this song with Dire Straits at
the Live Aid Concert at Wembley Stadium . [16] Prior to the Live Aid concert, in November 1984
Sting performed “ Do They Know It’s Christmas? ” with Band Aid for the relief of poverty
in Africa. [17] In 1985 Sting provided a short guest vocal performance on the Miles Davis album
You’re Under Arrest . He also sang backing vocals on Arcadia’s single “ The Promise “,
and on two songs from Phil Collins ‘ album No Jacket Required . He also contributed a version
of “ Mack the Knife ” to the Hal Willner -produced tribute album Lost in the Stars: The Music
of Kurt Weill . In September 1985, Sting performed “If You Love Somebody Set Them Free” at
the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards at the Radio City Music Hall in New York. [18]

Sting released …Nothing Like the Sun in 1987, including the hit songs “ We’ll Be
Together “, “ Fragile “, “ Englishman in New York “, and “ Be Still My Beating Heart
“, dedicated to his mother, who had recently died. It eventually went Double Platinum. The
song “The Secret Marriage” from this album was adapted from a melody by German composer
Hanns Eisler , and “Englishman In New York” was about the eccentric writer Quentin Crisp .
The album’s title is taken from William Shakespeare’s Sonnet 130 . [19]

Soon thereafter, in February 1988, he released Nada como el sol , a selection of five songs from
Sun sung (by Sting himself) in Spanish and Portuguese. He was also involved in two other
recordings in the late 1980s, the first in 1987 with jazz arranger Gil Evans , who placed Sting
in a big band setting for a live album of Sting’s songs (the CD was not released in the U.S.),
and the second on Frank Zappa ‘s 1988 Broadway the Hard Way album, where Sting performs an
unusual arrangement of “Murder By Numbers”, set to the tune “ Stolen Moments ” by jazz
composer Oliver Nelson , and “dedicated” to fundamentalist evangelist Jimmy Swaggart .
October 1988 saw the release of Igor Stravinsky’s The Soldier’s Tale with the London
Sinfonietta conducted by Kent Nagano . It featured Vanessa Redgrave , Sir Ian McKellen and
Sting in the role of the soldier. [20]

1990s



His 1991 album The Soul Cages was dedicated to his recently deceased father and included the
Top 10 song “ All This Time “, which reached No. 5 on the U.S. Pop chart, and the
Grammy-winning “The Soul Cages”. The album eventually went Platinum. The following
year, he married Trudie Styler and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in music from
Northumbria University . In 1991, Sting appeared on Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton
John & Bernie Taupin , an album dedicated to the singer/songwriter duo. Sting performed
“Come Down in Time”, for the album which also features other popular artists and their
renditions of John/Taupin Songs. The album was released on 22 October 1991 by Polydor. Also in
1991, a recording of Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf was made by Deutsche Grammophon,
narrated by Sting, and played by Claudio Abbado and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. This was
also used as the soundtrack to the television special Peter and the Wolf: A Prokofiev Fantasy.
In 1993, he released the album Ten Summoner’s Tales , which peaked at number two in the UK and
US Album Charts, and went triple platinum in just over a year. [14] [21] Ten Summoner’s Tales
was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1993 and nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the
Year in 1994. The title is a wordplay on his surname, Sumner, and The Summoner’s Tale , one of
The Canterbury Tales . Hit singles on the album include “ Fields of Gold ” and “ If I Ever
Lose My Faith in You .”, the latter earning Sting his second Grammy Award for Best Male Pop
Vocal Performance at the 36th Grammy Awards . [22] Concurrent video albums were released to
support Soul Cages (a live concert) and Ten Summoner’s Tales (recorded during the
recording sessions for the album).

In May 1993, he released a cover of his own Police song from the Ghost in the Machine album,
“Demolition Man”, for the Demolition Man film. Together with Bryan Adams and Rod Stewart
, Sting performed the chart-topping song “ All for Love ” for the film The Three Musketeers
. The song stayed at the top of the U.S. charts for five weeks and went Platinum; it is to date
Sting’s only song from his post-Police career to top the U.S. charts. In February, he won two
more Grammy Awards and was nominated for three more. [22] The Berklee College of Music gave him
his second honorary doctorate of music degree in May. In November, he released a greatest hits
compilation called Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting , which eventually was certified Double
Platinum. That same year, he was featured in a duet with Vanessa Williams on the song “Sister
Moon,” which appeared on her album The Sweetest Days . At the 1994 Brit Awards in London,
Sting won the award for Best British Male. [23]

His 1996 album, Mercury Falling debuted strongly with the single “Let Your Soul Be Your
Pilot”, but it dropped quickly on the charts. He reached the Top 40 with two singles the same
year with “You Still Touch Me” (June) and “ I’m So Happy I Can’t Stop Crying ”
(December) (which became a country music hit the next year in a version recorded with American
country singer Toby Keith ). During this period, Sting was also recording music for the
upcoming Disney film Kingdom of the Sun , which went on to be reworked into The Emperor’s New
Groove . The film went through drastic overhauls and plot changes, many of which were
documented by Sting’s wife, Trudie Styler . She captured the moment he was called by Disney
who then informed him that his songs would not be used in the final film. The story was put into a
final product: The Sweatbox , which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival . Disney currently
holds the rights to the film and will not grant its release. That same year Sting also released a
little-known CD-ROM called All This Time , which provided music, commentary and custom
computer features describing Sting and his music from his perspective.

Also in 1996, he provided some vocals for the Tina Turner single “ On Silent Wings ” as a part
of her Wildest Dreams album. In the same year, his performance with the Brazilian
composer/artist Tom Jobim in the song “ How Insensitive ” was featured in the AIDS benefit
album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization . Sting has also cooperated with Greek
popular singer George Dalaras , giving a common concert in Athens . “Moonlight”, a rare
jazz performance by Sting for the 1995 remake of Sabrina , written by Alan Bergman, Marilyn
Bergman and John Williams, was nominated for a 1997 Grammy Award for Best Song Written
Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television. In September 1997, Sting performed
“I’ll Be Missing You” with Puff Daddy at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards in tribute of the
late Notorious B.I.G. . [24]

2000s



The Emperor’s New Groove soundtrack was released with complete songs from the previous
version of the film, which included Rascal Flatts and Shawn Colvin . The final single used to
promote the film was “My Funny Friend and Me”. Sting’s September 1999 album Brand New
Day included the Top 40 hits “Brand New Day” and “ Desert Rose “. The album went Triple
Platinum by January 2001. In 2000, he won Grammy Awards for Brand New Day and the song of the same
name. At the awards ceremony, he performed “Desert Rose” with his collaborator on the
album version, Cheb Mami . For his performance, the Arab-American Institute Foundation gave
him the Khalil Gibran Spirit of Humanity Award. However, Sting was criticised for appearing
in a Jaguar advertisement using “Desert Rose” as its backing track, particularly as he
was a notable environmentalist.

In February 2001 he won another Grammy Award for his rendition of “She Walks This Earth
(Soberana Rosa)” on A Love Affair: The Music Of Ivan Lins . His song “After The Rain Has
Fallen” made it into the Top 40. His next project was to record a live album at his Tuscan
villa, which was to be released as a CD and DVD, as well as being simulcast in its entirety on the
internet. The CD and DVD were to be entitled On such a night and was intended to feature
re-workings of Sting favourites such as “Roxanne” and “If You Love Somebody Set Them
Free.” The concert, scheduled for 11 September 2001, was altered in various ways due to the
terrorist attacks in America that day . The webcast was shut down after one song (a reworked
version of “ Fragile “), after which Sting let it be up to the audience whether or not to
continue with the show. Eventually they decided to go through with the concert, and the
resultant album and DVD was released in November under a different title, …All This Time .
Both are dedicated “to all those who lost their lives on that day”. He performed a special
arrangement of “ Fragile ” with Yo-Yo Ma and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir during the
opening ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , Utah, US. [25]

In 2002 he won a Golden Globe Award for the song “ Until… ” from the film Kate and Leopold .
[22] Written and performed by him, “Until…” was also nominated for Academy Award for
Best Song . [22] At the 2002 Brit Awards in February, Sting received the prize for Outstanding
Contribution to Music. [23] In June he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame . In the
summer, Sting was awarded the British honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire
(CBE). At the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards in September, Sting won an Emmy Award for Outstanding
Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program, for his A&E special, Sting in
Tuscany… All This Time . [22] In 2003 he released Sacred Love , a studio album featuring
collaborations with hip-hop artist Mary J. Blige and sitar performer Anoushka Shankar . He
and Blige won a Grammy for their duet, “Whenever I Say Your Name”. The song is based on
Johann Sebastian Bachâ€™s Praeambulum 1 C-Major (BWV 924) from the Klavierbuechlein
fuer Wilhelm Friedemann Bach though Sting gave little comment on this adaptation. [26] The
album did not have the hit singles like his previous releases. The first single, “Send Your
Love” reached only No. 30 and reviews were mixed. However, the album did reach platinum
status by January 2004.

His autobiography Broken Music was published in October. He embarked on a Sacred Love tour in
2004 with performances by Annie Lennox . Sting went on the Broken Music tour, touring smaller
venues, with a four piece band starting in Los Angeles on 28 March 2005 and ending this
“College Tour” on 14 May 2005. Sting appears as a guest on the 2005 Monkey Business CD by
American hip-hop group The Black Eyed Peas , adding vocals to the track “Union” which
makes heavy use of samples from his Englishman in New York . Continuing with his involvement in
Live Aid , he appeared at Live 8 in July 2005. During 2006, Sting collaborated with Roberto Livi
in producing a Spanish language version of his cult classic “ Fragile ” entitled
“Fragilidad” on the album Rhythms Del Mundo by Latino recording legends “The Buena
Vista Sound” (previously known as the Buena Vista Social Club) available via
www.apeuk.org.

Sting with The Police at Madison Square Garden, New York, 1 August 2007

In October 2006, he released an album, to mixed reviews, entitled Songs from the Labyrinth
featuring the music of John Dowland (an Elizabethan -era composer) and accompaniment from
Bosnian lute player Edin Karamazov . Stingâ€™s musical interpretation of this English
Renaissance composer and his cooperation with Edin Karamazov brought him significant
recognition in classical music circles. [27] As a part of the promotion of this album, he
appeared on the fifth episode of Studio 60 during which he performed a segment of Dowland’s
“ Come Again ” as well as his own “ Fields of Gold ” in the arrangement for voice and two
archlutes . Reports surfaced in early 2007 that Sting would reunite with his former Police
band mates for a 30th anniversary tour. These rumours were confirmed by posts on the popular
fanzine Stingus and on various other news websites such as De Standaard , Yahoo! etc. In May
2007, Deutsche Grammophon released the opera Welcome to the Voice (composer Steve Nieve),
with Sting portraying Dyonisos.

On 11 February 2007, he reunited with the other members of The Police as the introductory act
for the 2007 Grammy Awards , singing “ Roxanne “, and subsequently announced The Police
Reunion Tour , the first concert of which was held in Vancouver on 28 May 2007 for 22,000 fans at
one of two nearly sold-out concerts. The Police toured for more than a year, beginning with
North America and eventually crossing over to Europe, South America, Australia & New Zealand
and Japan. The last concert was at Madison Square Garden on 7 August 2008, during which his
three daughters appeared with him onstage. Toronto documentary producer Vanessa Dylyn, who
was producing a film called The Musical Brain , featuring neuroscientist Daniel Levitin,
approached Sting about participating in the film. Sting was interested in the experience of
having his brain scanned by fMRI while different types of music were played to him. The film was
financed by CTV in Canada and National Geographic International (broadcast
internationally as My Music Brain ). Sting was also featured in Levitin’s second book, The
World in Six Songs , where several of his songs (including “ Russians “) are discussed.

He is featured as a playable character in the video game Guitar Hero World Tour . [28]

“Brand New Day” was the final song of the night for the Neighborhood Ball , one of ten
inaugural balls honouring President Barack Obama on Inauguration Day, 20 January 2009.
Sting was joined by Stevie Wonder on harmonica.

According to an article posted on his official website, Sting entered the studio in early
February 2009 to begin work on a new album If on a Winter’s Night… , [29] released on October
2009. [30] Initial reviews by fans that had access to early promotional copies were mixed, and
some questioned Sting’s artistic direction with this album. [31]

In October 2009, Sting played a concert in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, for an arts and cultural
festival. Despite claiming he thought the concert was sponsored by UNICEF , he faced
criticism in the press for receiving a payment of between one and two million pounds from Uzbek
president, Islam Karimov, for the performance. Karimov is accused by the UN and Amnesty of
human rights abuses and UNICEF stated they had no connection with the event. [32] In addition
to this the role of British diplomacy in general and this matter is discussed in this article by
Eurasianet.org. [33]

Name Is Nicole . The song was released on Scherzinger’s 2011 debut album Killer Love .

Sting recorded a new version of the song “Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot” as a duet with Glee
actor/singer Matthew Morrison , which appears on Morrison’s 2011 eponymous debut album .

Sting narrated the American premiere of the musical Yanomamo (1983), by Peter Rose and Anne
Conlon , outlining problems that existed in the Amazon rainforest. This was made into a film
and later broadcast as Song of the Forest . He also provided the voice of Zarm on the 1990s
television show Captain Planet and the Planeteers . In 1989 he starred as Macheath (Mack the
Knife) in John Dexter ‘s Broadway production of The Threepenny Opera . Sting also appeared
as himself in the video game Guitar Hero World Tour .

Activism



Sting’s first involvement in the human rights cause came in September 1981 when he was
invited by producer Martin Lewis to participate in the fourth Amnesty International gala The
Secret Policeman’s Other Ball following the example set at the 1979 show by Pete Townshend .
[36] Sting performed two of his Police compositions as a soloist â€“ “Roxanne” and
“Message in a Bottle”‘ â€“ appearing on all four nights of the show at the Theatre
Royal in London. Sting also led an impromptu super-group of other musicians (dubbed The
Secret Police ) performing at the show including Eric Clapton , Jeff Beck , Phil Collins ,
Donovan , Bob Geldof and Midge Ure in the show’s grand finale â€“ Sting’s own reggae
-tinged arrangement of Bob Dylan ‘s I Shall Be Released . The event was the first time that
Sting had worked with Geldof, Collins and Ure â€“ an association that developed further
with 1984′s Band Aid and 1985′s Live Aid . Sting’s performance at the Secret
Policeman’s Other Ball â€“ his first live appearances as a solo performer â€“
was prominently featured on the album of the show (being its lead tracks) and in the feature
film of the show.

His association with Amnesty continued throughout the 1980s and beyond and he was a
pioneering participant in many of Amnesty’s Human Rights Concerts â€“ a series of
music events and tours staged by the US Section of Amnesty International between 1986 and
1998.

In June 1986, Sting reunited with The Police for the last three shows of Amnesty’s six-date A
Conspiracy of Hope concerts of the US. The day after the final concert, he was interviewed on
NBC ‘s Today Show about the origins of his support for Amnesty International and he stated:
“I’ve been a member of Amnesty and a support member for five years, due to an entertainment
event called The Secret Policeman’s Ball and before that I did not know about Amnesty, I did
not know about its work, I did not know about torture in the world.” [37] Also in 1986, Sting
contributed a haunting song made famous by Billie Holiday, “Strange Fruit,” to a
fund-raising compilation album entitled Conspiracy of Hope: Honouring Amnesty
International’s 25th Anniversary .

A high point in his many contributions to the human rights cause came in 1988, when he joined a
team of other major musicians â€“ including Peter Gabriel and Bruce Springsteen
â€“ assembled under the banner of Amnesty International for the six-week Human Rights
Now! world tour commemorating the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights .

Sting with Chief Raoni in Paris, in April 1989

Sting had first shown his interest in social and political issues in his 1980 Police song
“Driven to Tears”, an angry indictment of apathy in the face of world hunger. Sting took
part in Bob Geldof ‘s “ Feed The World ” project in December 1984. Sting sang on “ Do They
Know It’s Christmas? ” â€“ the single recorded by Geldof’s super-group “Band
Aid” that eventually led to the Live Aid concert in July 1985, in which Sting also took part,
performing with Branford Marsalis , Phil Collins and Dire Straits .

In 1988, he released the single “ They Dance Alone ” which chronicled the plight of the
mothers, wives and daughters of the “disappeared”, the political opponents of the
regime killed by the Pinochet Government in Chile. Unable to publicly voice their grievances
to the government about their missing loved ones, for fear that they would “go missing”
too, the women of Chile would pin photos of their “disappeared” relatives on their
clothing, and dance in silent outrage against the government in public places. [38] Later,
Sting would perform the song on stage in Chile and Argentina, dancing with some of those same
women. He has said it was one of the most moving moments in his life.

With his wife Trudie Styler and Raoni Metuktire, a KayapÃ³ Indian leader in Brazil, Sting
founded the Rainforest Foundation Fund to help save the rainforests and protect the rights of
the indigenous peoples living there. In 1989 he flew to the Altamira Gathering to give a press
conference offering his support while promoting his charity. [39] His support for these
causes continues to this day, and includes an annual benefit concert held at New York’s
Carnegie Hall with Billy Joel, Elton John, James Taylor and other music superstars. A species
of Colombian tree frog, Dendropsophus stingi , was named after him in recognition of his
“commitment and efforts to save the rain forest”. [40]

On 21 October 1991, Sting joined Don Henley and Billy Joel at New York’s Madison Square
Garden for a benefit rock show, The Concert for Walden Woods.

On 15 September 1997, Sting joined Sir Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Sir Elton John, Phil
Collins and Mark Knopfler at London’s Royal Albert Hall for Music For Montserrat, a benefit
concert for the Caribbean island that had recently been devastated by an eruption from a
volcano. Sting and his wife Trudie Styler were awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience
award in Sherborn, Massachusetts on 30 June 2000. Singer/song writer, documentary film
producers for their commitment to the environment through the establishment of the
Rainforest Foundation; to human rights in China through the documentary film on Tiananmen
Square; and to peace and social justice through the powerful gift of song. [41]

In September 2001, Sting also took part in the post-9/11 rock telethon America: A Tribute to
Heroes singing “Fragile” to help raise money for the families of the victims of terror
attacks in the United States. Sting lost a close friend in the collapse of New York’s World
Trade Center towers.

In February 2005, Sting performed at the Leeuwin Estate Concert Series in Western Australia,
with the concert raising $4 million for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami relief
efforts. [42] [43] [44]

On 2 July 2005, Sting performed a complete set at the Live 8 concert, the follow-up to 1985′s
Live Aid concert.

In 2007, Sting joined Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland and played the closing set at the Live
Earth concert at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey . Joined by John Mayer and Kanye
West , Sting and The Police fittingly ended the show singing “Message in a Bottle,” as the
event was dubbed “The SOS Concert.”

In 2008 Sting contributed to an album called Songs for Tibet , to support Tibet and the current
Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso . [45]

On 22 January 2010, Sting performed “Driven to Tears” during the global telethon Hope for
Haiti Now . [46] On 25 April 2010, he performed on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. during
the 40th anniversary celebration of Earth Day . [47]

In 2010, Sting became a Patron of the poverty alleviation and beekeeping charity Bees for
Development [48]

In 2011, Sting was among more than 30 signatories to an open letter to British Prime Minister
David Cameron calling for the “immediate decriminalization of drug possession” if a
policy review shows it has failed. Sting was quoted: “Giving young people criminal records
for minor drug possession serves little purpose â€“ it is time to think of more
imaginative ways of addressing drug use in our society.” [49]

On 4 July 2011, Sting cancelled a concert appearance scheduled for the Astana Day Festival in
Astana, Kazakhstan. Amnesty International convinced him to cancel the appearance, due to
concerns over the rights of Kazakh oil and gas workers and their families. It was later
discovered that BGR Gabara “told undercover reporters from the Bureau for Investigative
Journalism that it was proposing to the Kazakh officials that they generate an ‘online
social media campaign” by Kazakh children who were upset about the cancellation”. [50]

He is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation . [51]

Sting at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 1 August 2007.

Sting married actress Frances Tomelty from Northern Ireland, on 1 May 1976. Before they
divorced in 1984, the couple had two children: Joseph (born 23 November 1976) and Fuchsia
Catherine (a.k.a. “Kate”, born 17 April 1982). Joe Sumner is a member of the band Fiction

born 19 January 1984), Jake (born 24 May 1985), Eliot Pauline (nicknamed “Coco”, born 30
July 1990), and Giacomo Luke (born 17 December 1995). Coco is the current singer and founder of
the London based group I Blame Coco . Both of Sting’s parents died from cancer in 1987. He did
not, however, attend either funeral stating that the media fuss would be disrespectful to his
parents. [55] 1995 found Sting preparing for a court appearance against his former
accountant who had misappropriated several million pounds of his money. [56] Sting owns
several homes worldwide, including Elizabethan manor house Lake House and its 60 acre

He participated in running races at Parliament Hill and charity runs similar to the British
10K. Around 1990 he met Danny Paradise who introduced him to yoga, and he later began
practising regularly. His practice consisted primarily of an Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga series,
though now he practices Tantra and Jivamukti Yoga as well. [59] He wrote a foreword to the book
Yoga Beyond Belief , [60] written by Ganga White in 2007.

An avid chess player, Sting played Garry Kasparov in an exhibition game in 2000, along with
four bandmates: Dominic Miller, Jason Rebello, Chris Botti , and Russ Irwin. Kasparov beat
all five simultaneously within 50 minutes. [61]

In 1969 Sting read the Gormenghast trilogy by Mervyn Peake and became a passionate fan. He
later bought the film rights to the books, and also named household pets, a race horse, his
publishing company, and even one of his daughters (Fuchsia) after characters from the books.
