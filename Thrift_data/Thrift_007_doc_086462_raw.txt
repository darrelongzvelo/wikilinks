Bradford Â (pronouncedÂ  /ËˆbrÃŠdfÉ™d/ Â (

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg/13px-Speaker_Icon.svg.png
Â  listen ) ) lies at the heart of theÂ  City of Bradford , aÂ  metropolitan borough
Â ofÂ  West Yorkshire , inÂ  Northern England . It is situated in the foothills of
theÂ  Pennines , 8.6Â miles (13.8Â km) west ofÂ  Leeds , and 16Â miles
(25.7Â km) northwest ofÂ  Wakefield . Bradford became aÂ  municipal borough Â in
1847, and received its charter as a city in 1897. FollowingÂ  local government reform
Â in 1974,Â  city status Â was bestowed upon theÂ  wider metropolitan borough .

Bradford has a population of 293,717, [ 1 ] Â making it theÂ  fourteenth-most populous
Â settlement in the UK. Bradford forms part of theÂ  West Yorkshire Urban Area
Â conurbation which in 2001 had a population of 1.5 million [ 2 ] Â and is part of the
Leeds-Bradford Larger Urban Zone (LUZ), the third largest in the UK after London and
Manchester, with an estimated population in the 2004Â  Urban Audit Â of 2.4 million. [ 3 ]

Historically Â a part of theÂ  West Riding of Yorkshire , Bradford rose to prominence
during the 19th century as an international centre ofÂ  textile manufacture ,
particularlyÂ  wool . It was aÂ  boomtown Â of theÂ  Industrial Revolution , and
amongst the earliestÂ  industrialised Â settlements, rapidly becoming the "wool
capital of the world". [ 4 ] Â The area's access to a supply of coal, iron ore and soft water
facilitated the growth of Bradford's manufacturing base, which, as textile manufacture
grew, led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment; Bradford has
fineÂ  Victorian architecture Â including the grand ItalianateÂ  City Hall .

The textile sector in Bradford fell into a terminal decline from the mid-20th century. Since
this time, Bradford has emerged as a tourist destination with attractions such as theÂ 
National Media Museum Â andÂ  Cartwright Hall . However, Bradford has faced similar
challenges to the rest of theÂ  post-industrial area ofÂ  Northern England ,
includingÂ  deindustrialisation , housing problems, social unrest and economic
deprivation.

Since the 1950s Bradford has experienced significant levels of immigration, particularly
fromÂ  Mirpur, Pakistan . Bradford has the second highest proportion ofÂ  Muslims
Â inÂ  England and Wales Â outside London. An estimated 101,967 people ofÂ  Asian
Â origin reside in the city, [ 5 ] Â representing around 20.5% of the city's population,
with this figure projected to rise to 28% by 2011. [ 6 ] Â Bradford is often cited as one of the
prime examples of 'parallel communities', where the population is effectively segregated
along ethnic, cultural and faith lines. [ 7 ]

Etymology



The name Bradford is derived from the "broadÂ  ford " at Church Bank (below the site ofÂ 
Bradford Cathedral ) around which a settlement had begun to appear before the time of theÂ 
Norman Conquest ("Bradeford" in theÂ  Domesday book Â of 1086). The ford crossed the
stream calledÂ  Bradford Beck .

History



Early history



Bradford was first settled inÂ  Saxon Â times and by theÂ  middle ages , had become a
small town centred on Kirkgate, Westgate and Ivegate. [ 8 ] Â Destroyed after an uprising in
1070 against theÂ  Norman conquest . [ 9 ] Â Bradford grew slowly over the next
two-hundred years as theÂ  woollen trade Â gained in prominence. TheÂ  Civil War
Â caused a decline in the industry but with the accession ofÂ  William and Mary in 1689
prosperity began to return. [ 8 ] Â The launch of manufacturing in the early 18th century
marked the start of the town's development while newÂ  canal Â andÂ  turnpike road
Â links encouraged trade.

19th century and the Industrial Revolution

Bradford Boundaries 1835.

At the turn of the 19th century, Bradford was a small ruralÂ  market town Â of 16,000
people, where wool spinning and cloth weaving was carried out in local cottages and farms.
TheÂ  Industrial Revolution Â led to rapid growth, with wool imported in vast
quantities for the manufacture ofÂ  worsted Â cloth in which Bradford specialised, and
the town soon became known as the wool capital of the world. [ 10 ] Â Yorkshire had plentiful
supplies ofÂ  soft water , which was needed in the cleaning of raw wool, and locally mined
coal provided the power that the industry needed. LocalÂ  sandstone Â was an excellent
resource for the building of the mills, and with a population of 182,000 by 1850, [ 11 ] Â the
town grew rapidly as workers were attracted by jobs in the textile mills. [ 10 ] Â Such
unprecedented growth did create problems, however. With over 200 factory chimneys
continually churning out black, sulphurous smoke, Bradford gained the reputation of being
the most polluted town in England. There were frequent outbreaks of cholera and typhoid, and
only 30% of children born to textile workers reached the age of fifteen. Life expectancy, of
just over eighteen years, was one of the lowest in the country. [ 12 ]

Lister's Mill

To support the textileÂ  mills , a large manufacturing base grew up in the town providing
textile machinery, and this led to diversification with different industries thriving side
by side. [ 10 ] Â Bradford's manufacturing history includes theÂ  Jowett Â Motor
Company, which had many great achievements during its 50 years of existence. [ 13 ]

Recent history



The textile industry began to fall into terminal decline in the 20th century. A culture of
innovation had been fundamental to Bradford's dominance, with new textile technologies
being invented in the city; a prime example being the work ofÂ  Samuel Lister . This
innovation culture continues today throughout Bradford's economy, from automotive (Kahn
Design) [ 14 ] Â to electronics ( Pace Micro Technology ).Â  Wm Morrison Supermarkets
Â was founded byÂ  William Morrison Â in 1899, initially as an egg and butter merchant
in Rawson Market, operating under the name ofÂ  Wm Morrison (Provisions) Limited . [ 15 ]

The grandest of the mills (no longer used for textile production) isÂ  Lister's Mill , the
chimney of which can be seen from most places in Bradford. It has recently become a beacon of
regeneration in the city after a Â£100Â million conversion to apartment blocks by
property developersÂ  Urban Splash . [ 16 ]

By 2001 Bradford had the second largest population of Asians of any UK city, with
approximately 68,000Â  Pakistanis , 12,500Â  Indians , 5,000Â  Bangladeshis
Â and 3,000 other Asians. However, the majority of people in the city are white (Ethnicity:
78.3% White, and 18.9% S.Asian). In January 1989, copies ofÂ  Salman Rushdie 'sÂ  The
Satanic Verses Â were publicly burnt in Bradford, and the city'sÂ  Muslim
Â community took the lead in the campaign against the book in the UK. In July 2001, ethnic
tensions led to seriousÂ  rioting in Bradford , leading to a report describing Bradford as
fragmented [ 17 ] Â and as a city of segregated ethnic communities. [ 18 ] Â Bradford has
suffered from deep-rooted de-industrialisation, and has some of the poorest levels of
social deprivation in the UK, [ 19 ] Â with widespread pockets of exclusion and rates of
unemployment in some wards exceeding 25%. [ 17 ]

Government

Bradford is represented by three MPs: for the constituencies ofÂ  Bradford East Â (
David Ward , Liberal Democrat),Â  Bradford South Â ( Gerry Sutcliffe , Labour), andÂ 
Bradford West Â ( Marsha Singh , Labour). Bradford is within theÂ  Yorkshire and the
Humber Â European constituency, which is represented by twoÂ  Conservative , oneÂ 
Labour , oneÂ  UKIP , oneÂ  Liberal Democrat Â and oneÂ  BNP Â  MEPs . The voting
figures for Bradford in theÂ  European Parliament election Â in June 2009 were:
Conservative 24.7%, Labour 22.6%, UKIP 14.9%, Lib Dem 13.4%, BNP 9.4%,Â  Green Â 8.8%. [
20 ]

The city played an important part in the early history of theÂ  Labour Party . A mural on the
back of the Priestley Centre For The Arts (visible from Leeds Road) commemorates the
centenary of the founding of theÂ  Independent Labour Party Â in 1893. [ 21 ]

Geography



Bradford is located atÂ 

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/WMA_button2b.png/17px-WMA_button2b.png
53Â°45â€²00â€³N Â  01Â°50â€²00â€³W Â (53.7500, -1.8333) 1 .
Topographically, it is located in the eastern part of the moorland region called theÂ 
South Pennines .



Unusually for a major city, Bradford is not built on any substantial body of water. TheÂ 
ford Â from which it takes its name (Broad-Ford) was a crossing of the stream called
Bradford Beck. The beck rises in the Pennine hills to the west of the city, and is swelled by
tributaries such as Horton Beck, Westbrook, Bowling Beck and Eastbrook. At the site of the
originalÂ  ford , just below the presentÂ  Bradford Cathedral , it turns north, and flows
more or less straight towards theÂ  River Aire Â atÂ  Shipley . Bradfordale (or
Bradforddale) is a name given by geographers to the valley of Bradford Beck (see for example
Firth 1997 [2] ). It can reasonably be regarded as one of theÂ  Yorkshire Dales , though as the
site of a big city, it is often not recognised as such.

Image: http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.17/common/images/magnify-clip.png Leeds
and Liverpool Canal Â ( Bingley )

The beck's course through the city centre is entirely underground, and was mostly so by the
middle of the 19th century. On the 1852Â  Ordnance Survey Â map of Bradford [3] Â it is
visible as far as Sun Bridge, at the end of Tyrrell Street, and then again from beside theÂ 
railway station Â at the bottom of Kirkgate. On the 1906 Ordnance Survey, [4] Â it
disappears at Tumbling Hill Street, off Thornton Road, and first appears again north of Cape
Street, off Valley Road, though there are further culverts as far as Queens Road. This is
substantially the position today.

TheÂ  Bradford Canal , built in 1774, took its water from Bradford Beck and its tributaries.
This supply was often inadequate to feed the locks, and the polluted state of the canal led to
its temporary closure in 1866: the canal was closed in the early 20th century as uneconomic.
'The Channel' is another facet of the Alsop plan, envisaging the creation of a new canal-side
community through its reopening. Destinations from Bradford

Climate



As with the rest of the UK, Bradford benefits from aÂ  maritime climate , with limited
seasonal temperature ranges, and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year.

The absolute maximum temperature recorded wasÂ  32.2 Â°C Â  (90.0Â Â°F) Â in
August 1990. [ 22 ] Â In an 'average' year, the warmest day should attain a temperature
ofÂ  27.2 Â°C Â  (81.0Â Â°F) , [ 23 ] Â with a total of 6 days [ 24 ] Â rising to a
maximum ofÂ  25.1 Â°C Â  (77.2Â Â°F) Â or above.

The absolute minimum temperature recorded wasÂ  âˆ’13.9 Â°C Â  (7Â Â°F)
Â during February 1947. The weather station's elevated suburban location means notably
low temperatures are unknown. Typically, 42.8 nights of the year will record an air frost.

Rainfall averages 870mm per year with over 1mm falling on 139 daysÂ  [ 25 ]

Sunshine, at little in excess of 1200 hours per year is low, as one would expect of an inland
location in Northern England located amongst upland areas. [ hide ] Climate data for

Demographics



As of theÂ  2001 UK census , Bradford had a population of 293,277. [ 27 ] Â There were
106,680Â  households Â in Bradford, and theÂ  population density Â was 4,560
inhabitants per square kilometre (11,820/sq mi). For every 100 females, there were 92.9
males. [ 27 ] Â Bradford has the youngest, fastest growing population outside London. [ 28 ]

Ethnicity



The census showed that 69.3% of Bradford's population wasÂ  White , 1.9%Â  Mixed Race ,
26.1%Â  Asian , 1.3%Â  Black Â and 1.4% from other races. 22.1% of the population are
ofÂ  British Asian Â origin, the highest percentage of South Asians in a single
settlement inÂ  England and Wales Â except in theÂ  London Borough of Tower Hamlets .
Nearly half of all Asians living inÂ  Yorkshire and the Humber Â live in Bradford, with
the central wards ofÂ  Bradford Moor ,Â  City ,Â  Little Horton ,Â  Manningham
Â andÂ  Toller Â each having large majority Asian populations. [ 29 ] Â It is
forecast that a combination of growing population movement, large-scale immigration and
the phenomenon ofÂ  white flight Â will mean that no race will hold a demographic
majority in Bradford by 2016. [ 30 ]

Religion



Bradford has a largeÂ  Muslim Â population, with 16.08% of the wider city identifying
themselves asÂ  Muslim Â in the 2001 census. [ 31 ] Â 60.14% identified themselves
asÂ  Christians , 1.02%Â  Sikhs Â and 0.95% Hindus . 13.3% identified themselves as
having no religion and 8.1% did not state a religious affiliation. The percentage ofÂ  Jews
,Â  Buddhists Â and those following other religions each amounted to fewer than 0.5% of
the city's population. [ 31 ]

The ONS Regional Trends report, published in June 2009, showed that most of Bradford suffers
from the highest levels of deprivation in the country. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Â Infant mortality stands
at double the national average, [ 34 ] Â and life expectancy is slightly lower than in other
parts of theÂ  district . [ 35 ]

UNESCO City of Film



In June 2009 Bradford was announced as the worldâ€™s firstÂ  UNESCO Â City of
Film.Â  UNESCO , the United Nations' cultural arm, said it was awarding Bradford the title
on the basis of its historic links to the production Â and distribution of films, its media
and film museum and its "cinematographic legacy".

TheÂ  National Media Museum , Bradford

Bradford is also known for its various film festivals hosted by the National Media Museum.
These includeÂ  The Bradford International Film Festival Â in March, which since it
began in 1995, has continued to be one of the outstanding events in the UKâ€™s film
calendar.

"Becoming the world's first City of Film is the ultimate celebration of Bradford's
established and dynamic history in film and media," said Colin Philpott, director of
Bradford's highly regardedÂ  National Media Museum . "With theÂ  UNESCO Â City of
Film designation, Bradford will now go on to achieve inspirational projects in film." [ 36 ]

The city has a rich heritage inÂ  film Â production and many films andÂ  TV
Â productions have been filmed in the city includingÂ  Room at the Top ,Â  Billy Liar
Â and The Red Riding Â Trilogy. [ 37 ]

Bradford has also been the location for the filmsÂ  Yanks , starringÂ  Richard Gere ,
andÂ  The Railway Children , a 1970s classic about the tribulations ofÂ  Victorian
children whose father goes missing.Â  Monty Python 's ground-breakingÂ  The Meaning of
Life Â and the controversial hitÂ  Rita, Sue and Bob Too , about a married man who cannot
choose between two teenage lovers, were also filmed in the city.

In recent years Bradford has developed a close relationship withÂ  Bollywood Â too,
hosting theÂ  International Indian Film Festival Â awards in 2007.

Simon Beaufoy , the Oscar-winning screenwriter ofÂ  Slumdog Millionaire Â who
originally hails from Bradford, said the city had played a crucial role in the story ofÂ 
cinema Â and deserved to be recognised. [ 36 ]

Cook Â Tour Operators Head Office, Godwin Street.

The economy of Bradford is worth around Â£7 billion, contributing around 8.4% of the
region's output, and making the district the third largest after Leeds and Sheffield in
Yorkshire & Humber.

Bradford's traditional textile industry has been in decline for many years. However,
Bradford's economy has diversified and the city is now home to several major companies,
notably in Finance ( Yorkshire Building Society ,Â  Provident Financial ), Electronics (
Pace Micro , Filtronic), Engineering (NG Bailey, Powell Switchgear), Manufacturing (Denso
Marston, BASF, Bailey Offsite). [ 38 ] Â Supermarket chainÂ  Morrisons Â has its head
office in the Hilmore House in Bradford. [ 39 ]

One of the cities biggest employers isÂ  Provident Financial plc , a financial services
group that specialises inÂ  Home Collected Credit (HCC) Â and also owns Vanquis
Â which offersÂ  credit cards . It is listed on theÂ  London Stock Exchange Â and is a
constituent of theÂ  FTSE 250 Index . The Company was established in Bradford in 1880 by
Joshua Kelley Waddilove to provide affordable credit to families inÂ  West Yorkshire . [ 40
] Â The Company has recently moved into a new 250,000 sq ft, Â£45 million flagshipÂ 
headquarters Â building in the city centre on the corner of Godwin Street and Thornton
Road, creating hundreds of jobs for the city. The new buildingâ€™s structure, also
houses a 200-bedÂ  Juryâ€™s Hotel . [ 40 ]

Thomas Cook Â also has its Tour Operators Head Office, which employs about 1000 staff in the
City.

Landmarks

Bradford's oldest building is theÂ  cathedral , which for most of its life was a parish
church. Few otherÂ  Medieval Â buildings have survived apart fromÂ  Bolling Hall ,
which has been preserved as a museum.

TheÂ  Wool Exchange, Bradford

There are some fineÂ  Victorian buildings : apart from the abundance of mills, there is
theÂ  City Hall Â (with statues of rulers of England unusually includingÂ  Oliver
Cromwell ), the formerÂ  Wool Exchange , and a large Victorian cemetery at
Undercliffe.Â  Little Germany Â is a splendid Victorian commercial district just east
of the city centre which takes its name from 19th century immigrants who ran businesses from
some of the manyÂ  listed buildings . Following decades of decay there have been successful
conversions to office and residential use. In mid-2005 renovation began on the prominent
Eastbrook Hall in Little Germany. Bradford also has a number ofÂ  architecturally
Â historic hotels that date back to the establishment of the two railway lines into the city
centre, back inÂ  Victorian times. The Victoria Hotel and theÂ  Midland Hotel Â were
built to accommodate business travellers to the city during the height of the woollen trade.

Like many cities, Bradford lost a number of notable buildings toÂ  developers Â in the
1960s and 1970s: particularly mourned at the time were theÂ  Swan Arcade and the old
Kirkgate Market. In recent years some buildings from that era have themselves been
demolished and replaced: Provincial House, next to Centenary Square, was demolished by
controlled explosion in 2002, [ 41 ] Â and Forster House was pulled down in 2005 as part of
theÂ  Broadway development .

Bradford's main art gallery is housed in the grand EdwardianÂ  Cartwright Hall Â inÂ 
Lister Park . TheÂ  National Media Museum Â celebrates cinema and movies, and is the most
visited museum outside London. It contains anÂ  Imax Â cinema, theÂ  Cubby Broccoli
Â Cinema, and theÂ  Pictureville Â CinemaÂ â€” described by David Puttnam
as the best cinema in Britain. [ 42 ]

Also in the city is TheÂ  St George's Hall Â - a grand concert hall dating from 1853 making
it the oldest concert hall in Britain and the third oldest in the whole of Europe. [ citation
needed ] Â The former Odeon cinema was the recent focus of protests by Bradfordians who did
not wish to see the old building close. Adjacent is theÂ  Alhambra Â theatre, built in
1914 for theatre impresario Frank Laidler, and later owned by the Moss Empire group ( Oswald
Stoll Â andÂ  Edward Moss ). The theatre was refurbished in 1986.

Bradford Forster Square railway station

In past centuries Bradford's location in Bradfordale made communications difficult,
except from the north. Nonetheless, Bradford is now well-served by transport systems.
Bradford was first connected to the developingÂ  turnpike Â network in 1734, when the
firstÂ  Yorkshire Â turnpike was built betweenÂ  Manchester andÂ  Leeds
Â viaÂ  Halifax Â and Bradford.

    Today Bradford lies on severalÂ  trunk roads :

    - TheÂ  A647 Â betweenÂ  Leeds Â andÂ  Halifax , viaÂ  Queensbury

    

    - TheÂ  A650 Â betweenÂ  Wakefield Â andÂ  Keighley

    

    - TheÂ  A658 Â toÂ  Harrogate

    

    - TheÂ  A6036 Â toÂ  Halifax Â viaÂ  Shelf

    



TheÂ  M606 , a spur off theÂ  M62 Â  motorway , connects Bradford with the national
motorway network. Although it was originally planned to go directly into the city centre,
this has never been built and is unlikely now ever to be, as a hotel has been built across the
proposed route.

TheÂ  Bradford Canal Â was a 4-mile (6.4Â km) long spur off theÂ  Leeds and
Liverpool Canal Â atÂ  Shipley . It was planned and built as part of the original Leeds and
Liverpool project, to connect Bradford with theÂ  limestone Â  quarries Â ofÂ 
north Yorkshire , the industrial towns on both sides of theÂ  Pennines Â and the ports on
each coast. It opened in 1774, closed in 1866, reopened in 1871, and finally closed in 1922.
There are plans to rebuild the canal as a key part of the regeneration of the city centre (see
theÂ  main article ).

Entrance to theÂ  Bradford Interchange

TheÂ  Leeds and Bradford Railway Â opened Bradford's first railway station on 1 July
1846. It offered a service viaÂ  Shipley Â toÂ  Leeds . The station was rebuilt in the
early 1850s and again, in 1890. Today it is a smaller railway station dating from 1990,
calledÂ  Forster Square railway station Â though it is somewhat distant fromÂ 
Forster Square Â itself.

TheÂ  Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Â opened its station at Drake Street on 9 May
1850, on its line betweenÂ  Manchester Â andÂ  Leeds . TheÂ  Great Northern Railway
Â opened a third terminus atÂ  Adolphus Street Â to serve Leeds and places on its
network in 1854, but the station was located too far from the centre, and the two companies
eventually agreed to build a joint station to replace the L&Y's station at Drake Street. This
station was namedÂ  Bradford Exchange railway station , and opened in 1867. [ 43 ]
Â Adolphus Street remained as a goods terminal. By 1973, The Exchange Station was deemed
too large and was rebuilt on a different site. In 1983 that station was renamedÂ  Bradford
Interchange Â when a large bus station was built alongside. BothÂ  Forster Square
Â andÂ  Bradford Interchange Â stations are under the control of the West Yorkshire
Metro as part of the Leeds-Bradford Line routes.

Bradford trolleybus Â in Leeds Road, Greengates, in May 1971.

There have been many schemes to build a link between Bradford's main railway terminals, but
none has ever come to fruition. The major redevelopment of the city centre in the 1960s
provided an opportunity to connect the two termini but this was not pursued. A limitation
currently exists with such a connection in that large buildings were constructed on the
alignment in the 1990s. The main practical difficulty in connecting the termini is the great
difference in elevation: theÂ  Interchange Â station is already at the bottom of a long
slope, steep by railway standards, but is still many feet higher thanÂ  Forster Square
Station . However, this gradient is not unprecedented in railway construction terms and the
relocation of Forster Square Station further from the city centre has provided additional
space in which the transition could be accomplished.

Bradford'sÂ  tram Â system was begun byÂ  Bradford Corporation Â in 1882. At first
the vehicles wereÂ  horse-drawn Â but were replaced byÂ  steam-driven Â trams in
1883, and byÂ  electric Â ones in 1898. On 20 June 1911, Britain's firstÂ  trolleybus
Â systems opened simultaneouslyÂ  in Bradford , between Laisterdyke and Dudley Hill,
andÂ  in Leeds . [ 44 ] Â The last service in BradfordÂ â€” and indeed in
BritainÂ â€” ceased operation on 26 March 1972. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Â Ten Bradford
trolleybuses are now preserved at theÂ  Trolleybus Museum Â atÂ  Sandtoft ,Â 
Lincolnshire . [ 46 ] Â In 1974 Bradford's municipal buses were taken over by theÂ  West
Yorkshire Metro .Â  First Bradford Â andÂ  Arriva Â are now the chief operators of
buses in Bradford, with some routes usingÂ  guided buses .

Bradford is served byÂ  Leeds Bradford International Airport , 6Â miles (9.7Â km) to
the north east of the city. Bradford and Leeds councils jointly opened the airport in 1931.
There has been rapid expansion in recent years, and is the home base of economy AirlineÂ 
Jet2.com . In May 2007 the joint councils sold the airport toÂ  Bridgepoint Capital Â for
Â£145.5Â million. Bridgepoint announced that a further Â£70Â million would be
invested in airport improvements, to boost passenger figures to over 7Â million by 2015. [
47 ] Â The airport has recently announced a new long-haul route toÂ  Islamabad Â using
wide-bodiedÂ  Airbus A310 Â aircraft. [ 48 ]

TheÂ  Alhambra Â theatre in Bradford city centre

There are four theatres in Bradford: aside from TheÂ  Alhambra , there is a smaller Studio
theatre in the same complex. Both of these are operated byÂ  City of Bradford Metropolitan
District Council . The Theatre in the Mill is a small studio theatre at theÂ  University of
Bradford Â which presents both student and community shows and small-scale touring
professional work.Â  The Priestley Â Theatre is a privately run venue with a
medium-sized proscenium theatre and a small studio.

Among the professional theatre companies based in Bradford areÂ  Kala Sangam , theÂ 
satirical Â madcap comedy troop,Â  Komedy Kollective ,Â  Lost Dog Â (based at
Theatre In The Mill) andÂ  Mind the Gap , one of the longest established, who have always
worked with a mixture ofÂ  disabled Â and able-bodied performers. Groups and
organisations teaching theatre include TheÂ  Asian Theatre School , Bradford Stage and
Theatre School andÂ  Stage 84 . There are also a number of amateur theatre groups.

St George's Hall Â is a grand concert hall dating from 1853 making it the oldest concert hall
in Britain and the third oldest in the whole of Europe. [ citation needed ] TheÂ  HallÃ©
Orchestra Â have been regular visitors over the years, as have a wide range of popular
musicians, bands, entertainers and comedians. It is sometimes used for theatrical
productions. Although Bradford was home to composerÂ  Frederick Delius , there are
currently no prominent professional music ensembles based in Bradford, though there are
some prominent amateur groups such as theÂ  Bradford Festival Chorus .

,Â  Southern Death Cult / The Cult , The Scene,Â  One Minute Silence ,Â  Terrorvision
and AsianÂ  hip hop Â groupÂ  Fun-Da-Mental .

TraditionalÂ  cinemas Â have been replaced by vast entertainment complexes with
multi-screen cinemas. TheÂ  Leisure Exchange Â in the city centre is home to a 16 screen
Cineworld and atÂ  Thornbury , on the outskirts of Bradford, stands theÂ  Odeon
Leeds-Bradford Â with 13 screens. The latter replaced the old Odeon next to the Alhambra
which is the continuing focus of protests by Bradfordians who do not wish to see the old
building demolished. [ 53 ] Â The University of Bradford also has a cinema run by the
Students' Union, operating from the University's Great Hall. [ 54 ]

Nightlife in Bradford has traditionally centred around Manor Row and Manningham Lane. More
recently, several clubs andÂ  pubs Â have opened in the West End of Bradford, around
theÂ  Alhambra Theatre , turning what was previously a fairly quiet area into one that is
often crowded and vibrant at night.

picturesque and atmospheric moorlands: the famousÂ  Ilkley Moor Â and moors aboveÂ 
Haworth Â known internationally for its connection with the BrontÃ« sisters .

Bradford was one of the first areas of the UK to get a local commercial radio stationÂ 
Pennine Radio Â in September 1975. Today this isÂ  The Pulse of West Yorkshire
Â andÂ  Pulse Classic Gold . As of 2006Â Bradford Community Broadcasting based in the

Bradford City's Â  Valley Parade Â  football stadium

League football Â was introduced toÂ  West Yorkshire Â in Bradford, whenÂ 
Bradford City Â were formed inÂ  1903 . James Whyte, a sub-editor of theÂ  Bradford
Observer had met withÂ  Football Association Â representative John Brunt in January to
discuss the plans, and in May, Manningham RFC, a rugby league side decided to change codes
toÂ  association football . [ 60 ] Â The Football League subsequently elected Bradford
City to the league, with a total of 30 votes to replaceÂ  Doncaster Rovers , [ 61 ] Â because
it saw the invitation as a chance to introduce football to the rugby-dominated county. [ 62 ]
Â Just eight years after they were elected to the league, City won theÂ  FA Cup Â and
recorded the highest league position in their history. [ 63 ] Â The club now plays inÂ  the
bottom tier Â of The Football League following two periods ofÂ  administration , [ 64 ] [
65 ] [ 66 ] Â but their ground suffered one of theÂ  worst all-time sporting disasters in
the world Â after 56Â people died atÂ  Valley Parade Â on 11 May 1985. [ 67 ] Â A
second side from the city,Â  Bradford Park Avenue Â were successful inÂ  The Football
League Â until they dropped out of the Football League in 1970. They now play in theÂ 
Northern Premier League , which means theÂ  Bradford derby Â has not been played in
years. Their ground hosted county cricket forÂ  Yorkshire Â as well as football.

Bradford was once home to the now-defunctÂ  Bradford Dukes Â  speedway Â team, which
raced at Odsal. Speedway was staged at Greenfields Stadium in the pioneer days, when it was
known as the Autodrome, and it was used for a couple of seasons in the early 1960s. Odsal opened
its doors soon after the war in Europe ended in 1945 and continued in the late 1950s. It entered a
team in the 1960 Provincial League then fell dormant until the 1970s when it re-opened and ran
for many years. The track staged a number of big meetings including Speedway World Finals. The
speedway team rode under a number of names - probably the longest running was Bradford
Northern - in common with the Rugby League team at the same venue. This was changed after years
of decline to Bradford Barons - emulating the more successful Halifax Dukes. Eventually the
Halifax team was brought to Bradford under the name Bradford Dukes.

Bradford is also home to theÂ  Bradford Dragons Â basketball team who are currently
playing in the EBL2 and play there home games at Bradford Sports college in the Trinity Green
campus on Saturday nights. They are coached by former England under 23 player Chris Mellor.

Religion

See also:Â  Bradford Cathedral Â andÂ  Al Mahdi Mosque

The most prominent Christian church in Bradford isÂ  Bradford Cathedral , originally
theÂ  Parish Church Â of St Peter. The parish of Bradford was in existence by 1283, and
there was a stone church on the shelf above Bradford Beck by 1327. TheÂ  Diocese of Bradford
Â was created from part of theÂ  Diocese of Ripon Â in 1919, and the church became a
cathedral at that time.

Mosque in Carlisle Road

With such a significant Pakistani population,Â  Islam Â has become prominent
throughout Bradford. This is particularly the case in inner city areas such as Manningham ,
where a majority of the population are Muslim. [ 68 ] Â Accordingly, there are a substantial
number of mosques. Some were converted from churches or other buildings, but there are also
several that have been purpose-built. The largest of these is the Hanfia Masjid inÂ 
Manningham . Another large mosque in Bradford is theÂ  Al Mahdi Mosque Â of theÂ 
Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Â and the Madni Jamia Masjid which recently won the Model
Mosque (Islam Channel) award.

The city also has a sizeable Indian community, and there are a significant number ofÂ 
Hindus Â in the area. TheÂ  Lakshmi Narayan mandir Â opened officially on 20 April
2008 [ 69 ] Â and is the largest Hindu temple in Northern England. [ 70 ] Â Also in Bradford
is the Hindu Temple and Community Centre on Thornton Lane. [ 71 ] There are also smaller
house-based mandirs, as shown in theÂ  List of Hindu Temples .

There is also a prominentÂ  Sikh Â community in Bradford, with sixÂ  gurudwaras
Â (Sikh places of worship) around the city. The Sikh festival ofÂ  Vaisakhi
Â (alternative spelling of Baisakhi) is also celebrated on 14 April every year, this sees
Sikhs from Bradford and the surrounding area travel to each of the gurudwaras in the city in a
procession called a nagar kirtan. There are three gurudwaras in the Leeds Road area of
Bradford alone, Guru Gobind Singh Gurudwara, on Gobind Marg, being the largest of these.
There is a Ramgharia Gurudwara on Bolton Road and Guru Nanak Gurudwara is on Wakefield Road. [
72 ]

Over the years, most of theÂ  Jewish Â population have migrated toÂ  Leeds . TheÂ 
Jewish Â community in Bradford was strong in the middle to late 19th century, and there is a
19th centuryÂ  Reform Â  synagogue Â in Bowland Street in theÂ  Manningham
Â area. This, "The oldest Reform synagogue outside London", [ 73 ] Â was established by
German Jews who had moved to Bradford for the wool trade. According to historian Shatman
Kadish, "The city of Bradford was unique in that it boasted a Reform synagogue before it
acquired an Orthodox one". [ 74 ]

The district has a tradition ofÂ  nonconformity Â which is reflected in the number of
chapels erected byÂ  Congregationalists ,Â  Baptists ,Â  Methodists Â etc. The
city was a major centre of theÂ  House Church movement in the 1980s, and the Christian
charityÂ  Christians Against Poverty Â was founded in the city. Other house churches in
the city includeÂ  El Shaddai International Christian Centre Â and the World Outreach
Church. Bradford is also home to theÂ  Abundant Life Church , a large nonconforming Church,
that has around 3,000 members. [ 75 ]

Two carved stones, probably parts of aÂ  Saxon Â preaching cross, were found on the site
of Bradford Cathedral. They indicate that Christians may have worshipped here sinceÂ 
Paulinus of York Â came to the north of England in ADÂ 627 on aÂ  mission Â to
convertÂ  Northumbria . He preached inÂ  Dewsbury Â and it was from there that
Bradford was first evangelised. The vicars of Bradford later paid dues to thatÂ  parish .

City of Sanctuary



On 18 November 2010, Bradford was officially recognized as a â€˜City ofÂ  Sanctuary
â€™Â : â€œ.. a place where a broad range of local organizations,Â  community
Â groups andÂ  faith Â communities, as well asÂ  local government , are publicly
committed to welcoming and including people seeking sanctuary.â€�

The city of Bradford has a proud history of welcoming and including newcomers from all corners
of the world and The City ofÂ  Sanctuary Â Bradford campaign was officially launched on 1
October 2008, with a vision to see thisÂ  culture Â of welcome andÂ  hospitality
Â extended to include those seeking sanctuary in the city. [ 76 ]

"The recognition of Bradford as a City ofÂ  Sanctuary Â will be a huge boost for the city",
said Will Sutcliffe, chairman of Bradfordâ€™s project. â€œThere are a lot of very
good voluntary projects for people seeking sanctuary. â€œPeople who have fled for their
lives from some of the worst trouble spots in the world are more likely to find a welcome and help
in Bradford than in many other cities. Bradford can stand up and be proud of itself." [ 77 ]

Bradford Royal Infirmary

There are two major hospitals in Bradford:Â  Bradford Royal Infirmary Â andÂ  St
Luke's Hospital . Both are teaching hospitals and are operated by Bradford Teaching
Hospitals NHS trust. Over the years the Trust has subsumed a number of smaller hospitals;
these include Woodlands Orthopaedic Hospital, Northern View and Bierley Hall.

Bradford is the focus of one of the UK's largest ever birth cohort studies, known asÂ  Born in
Bradford . Partly supported by European funding, it is the result of close collaboration
between theÂ  University of Bradford , theÂ  NHS Â and other institutions in West
Yorkshire. It will track the lives of all the babies born in the city from 2006 to 2008 and aims to
provide a wealth of data, allowing health researchers the opportunity to investigate many
different aspects of health and wellbeing.

Carnivals and festivals



Each year Bradford hosts several successful festivals.

TheÂ  Bradford Mela , [ 78 ] Â the biggest of its kind outsideÂ  Asia , takes place in
June. The wordÂ  Mela Â comes from Sanskrit language meaning â€˜a
gatheringâ€™ or â€˜to meetâ€™. In the UK, Melas provide an opportunity for
communities to come together to celebrate and share their cultures. Mela festivals include a
combination ofÂ  markets , funfairs, food and drink, arts and workshops,
childrenâ€™s activities, strolling entertainment and a variety of music and dance
performances on a number of stages. Bradford held the firstÂ  Mela Â in Europe in
September 1988 and has been held inÂ  Peel Park Â since 1998. As the most established
event of its kind in the UK, Bradford Mela leads the way, and has served as the model for Mela
events in other cities.

Bradford is also known for its various film festivals hosted by theÂ  National Media Museum
. These include TheÂ  Bradford International Film Festival Â in March, which since it
began in 1995, has continued to be one of the outstanding events in the UKâ€™s film
calendar, [ 79 ] Â plus the Bradford Animation Festival - The UK's longest-running and
biggestÂ  animation Â festival, held each November which sees an array of screentalks,
workshops and special events led by some of the industry's top names. The festival culminates
in the annual BAF Awards which celebrate the very best in new animation from around the world. [

for local bands from across West Yorkshire to a large audience. [ 82 ]

Upper Globe pub was attacked during the riot and has since lain derelict.

The Bradford Riots were a short but intense period ofÂ  rioting Â which began on 7 July
2001, in Bradford,Â  West Yorkshire , England. It occurred as a result of heightened
tension betweenÂ  ethnic minority Â communities and the city's white majority, stoked
by confrontation between theÂ  Anti-Nazi League Â andÂ  far right groups such as
theÂ  National Front . [ 85 ] [ 86 ] Â SimilarÂ  race riots Â had occurred a few days
earlier in other parts ofÂ  northern England . More than 300 police officers were hurt
during the riot. There were 297 arrests in total; 187 people were charged with riot, 45 with
violent disorder and 200 jail sentences totalling 604 years were handed down, the most ever
handed out for public disturbance by some margin. [ 87 ]

In popular culture



In the BBC political satireÂ  The Amazing Mrs Pritchard , Â the Prime Minister considers
a proposal to move Parliament to Bradford, as it is closer to the geographic centre of the
country than London. The Buttershaw Â area of the city featured in the 1986 filmÂ  Rita,
Sue and Bob Too , in which two 16-year-old girls were involved in a love triangle with a wealthy
married man (played byÂ  George Costigan ). The film was created byÂ  Andrea Dunbar , who
died four years after it was made. It was initially unpopular with local residents due to its
negative image of the area, but has since earned itself a good reputation in the local
community as Buttershaw's claim to fame. [ 88 ] [ 89 ]

Bradford features in the 1983 filmÂ  Monty Python's The Meaning of Life Â with footage
filmed inÂ  Lister Park . [ 90 ] Â The newÂ  Spooks Â spin-off forÂ  BBC Three ,Â 
Spooks: Code 9 Â was filmed in Bradford. [ 91 ]

Bradford is also in the filmÂ  East is East . Oak Lane is shown in the film when the family go to
Bradford to visit Mr.Shahand his family. [ 92 ]
