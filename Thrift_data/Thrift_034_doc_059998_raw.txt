Turism in Brazil

April 4, 2010

Â 

Did you know that Brazil is the most visited country in the South America by tourists? Around 5
million of them come here every year.

The most visited city is Rio de Janeiro, because they say that is a great place to relax.

However, wherever people go, theyâ€™re able to find culture and beauty: Brazil is the
most miscegenated country in America with the worldâ€™s prettiest women!

Our Music (videos)

April 3, 2010

The soundscapes is a brazilian band, but they areÂ famous in NY City.

Anna julia, originally from Los Hermanos, the song was recorded by Jim Capaldi and George
Harrison (George Harrison from the Beatles!)

CSS (Cansei de Ser Sexy) are not famous in their hometown, but they’ve been in long tours in
Usa and Europe.

Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan need more Portuguese lessons but their talent is undeniable.

The Girl from Ipanema

April 3, 2010

Â Â Â Â Â  “The Girl from Ipanema” ( “ Garota de Ipanema “ ) is a well
knownÂ Bossa novaÂ song, a worldwide hit in the mid-1960s that won a Grammy for Record of
the Year in 1965. It was written in 1962, with music byAntonio Carlos JobimÂ and Portuguese
lyrics by Vinicius de MoraesÂ with English lyrics written later by NormalÂ Gimbel.

The first commercial recording was in 1962, by Pery Ribeiro. The version performed by Astrud
Gilberto , along with JoÃ£o Gilberto and Stan Getz , from the 1964 album Getz/Gilberto ,
became an international hit, reaching #5 in the United States , #29 in the United Kingdom , and
charting highly throughout the world. Numerous recordings have been used in movies,
sometimes as an elevator music clichÃ© (for example, near the end of The Blues Brothers ).

In 2004, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the
National Recording Registry .

This song is the only non-english song to receive the “Grammy for The Record of The year”
since 1960.

“The girl from Ipanema” was recorded by much differnt artists included Frank
Sinatra,Â  Stan Getz, Ella fitzgerald, Diana Krall and others.

This song is one of the most played songs ever.
