Shadow People

Shadow people are supernatural shadow-like humanoid figures that, according to believers,
are seen flickering on walls and ceilings in the viewer's peripheral vision. They are often
reported moving with quick, jerky movements, and quickly disintegrate into walls or
mirrors. They are believed to be evil and aggressive in nature, although a few people consider
them to be a form of guardian angel.

In 2010, the apparitions were described as one of the most regularly reported paranormal
phenomena in the United States. This is attributed to occasional reports on the Coast to Coast
AM show, where paranormal researcher Heidi Hollis has been interviewed several times on the
subject of shadow people. Hollis believes that shadow people have always existed, that they
feed upon emotions of fear, and that they can be repelled by thinking positively. Others
believe that shadow people may be the extra-dimensional inhabitants of another universe.

The stories of shadow people have been compared to those of the Raven Mocker, a witch from
Cherokee mythology who sometimes appears as a shadowy phantom, and the Islamic Jinn.

Several scientific principles can be used to explain reports of apparitional experiences
such as shadow people. These include optical illusions or hallucinations brought on by
physiological or psychological circumstances, drug use or side effects of medication, and
the interaction of external agents on the human body. Another reason that could be behind the
illusion is sleep deprivation, which may lead to hallucinations.

Shadow people are always seen in groups, they are usually darker than dark!

The Bermuda Triangle



Image:

The Bermuda, or Devil’s, Triangle is an area of ocean found off the south-eastern tip
of the United States. It is a region of water indelibly connected with mysterious vessel
disappearances; the popular perception is that countless boats and planes have been
inexplicably lost there. The triangle extends from Bermuda to Miami and then to the
Puerto Rico, and is said to contain a supernatural secret. Some high profile
disappearances have occurred there, and the notion of its existence has been turned into
a modern myth in the media. Even the term ‘Bermuda Triangle’ was coined in a fictional
publication. But does the sea here really house some unknown power that pulls sea and
airmen to their doom, or is this mystery based mainly on imagination?

The most famous loss in the triangle is known as the mystery of Flight 19, and happened on
5th December 1945. A squadron of five US Navy Avenger torpedo bombers set off from their
base in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to conduct a practice mission over the island of Bimini.
The flight contained 14 men, all of them students apart from the commander, Lt Charles
Taylor. About an hour and a half after the mission began, radio operators received a
signal from Taylor saying his compasses were not working, but he believed he was over
the Florida Keys. He was advised to fly north which would bring him back to the mainland.
In fact, he was over the Bahamas, and his attempts to head north and north-east merely
took him further away from solid ground. A terrible storm that day
hampered communications and it seems Taylor rejected a suggestion to pass control of the
squadron to one of the other pilots.

Radio contact was entirely lost and search craft were dispatched to try and find
the flight to guide them back in. Of the three planes used to rescue Flight 19, one
lost communications itself because of an iced over aerial, one was just unsuccessful
whilst another seemed to explode shortly after takeoff. Flight 19 itself has never been
found, but it is assumed that they ditched into the raging sea when their fuel ran out, with
the heavy planes rapidly sinking to the ocean floor. The US Navy recorded that the
disaster was caused by Taylor’s confusion, but an appeal by his family had this
overturned, and a verdict of ‘causes or reasons unknown’ was given. However, Flight
19 is not the only high profile official loss in the area, and the USS Cyclops and Marine
Sulphur Queen have also disappeared without trace.

The legend of Flight 19 was cemented by its inclusion in Steven Spielberg’s
Close Encounters of the Third Kind movie. Indeed, some theories state that visiting UFO
craft enter an underwater base in the Bermuda area, and they have been the cause of
the disappearances. Other fantastical ideas such as technologies from Atlantis or evil
marine creatures have also been considered. Some people even suggest the triangle is the
site of a gateway into another dimension. Strange oceanographic features such as huge
clouds of methane gas escaping from the seabed have also been blamed for the
disappearances. In reality, the triangle does have one natural quality which may
contribute to the losses. Unlike everywhere else in the world (apart from the Dragon’s
Triangle near Japan) compasses point to true north rather than magnetic north. This may
be a contributing factor to the triangle’s legend, but the US Coastguard officially
believes the losses are caused by a mixture of environmental and man-made mistakes. This
region is used by a large amount of ocean and air traffic, much of which is navigated by
inexperienced pleasure-seekers. A strong Gulf Stream and unpredictable weather
conditions not only cause vessels to run into trouble, but also remove many traces of them
once they have been wrecked.

It is interesting also to note that the coastguard does not view the area as having a
particularly high incidence of accidents. One researcher examined many
historic losses in the triangle. He came to the conclusion that rumours and elaboration
had clouded the real, understandable, causes behind the events. Similarly, the
international insurers, Lloyd’s of London, have records that demonstrate that this
region near Bermuda is no more treacherous than any other waterway. However, the myth
of the Bermuda Triangle is so strong it will live on as long as fictional writers use it as a
site of mysterious happenings.

    - The diprotodon weighed three tons and was 14ft long 

    

    - It lived between 25,000 and two million years ago 

    

It did not eat flesh, but whatever got in its way would have been trampled to death, scientists
agreed today after the first complete skeleton of a prehistoric monster was found in
Australia.



Known as a diprotodon and likened to a giant wombat, weighing three tons and stretching up to
14ft long, it roamed the Australian continent between 25,000 and two million years ago.



What is known, from a fragment of bone from the remains of another diprotodon discovered in New
South Wales, is that these creatures lived on the continent at the same time as the early
Aborigines.

Reconstruction: The first complete skeleton of a prehistoric monster has been found by
scientists in north-west Queensland, Australia



A small hole was found in that fragment, suggesting that the animal was brought down by a spear.



But that was just one bone and, until the latest discovery in north-west Queensland's Gulf of
Carpentaria region, a complete skeleton had not been found.



'We hope we will now be able to reconstruct the bones, put them into their original positions,
to give us a pretty good idea of what these creatures looked like,' said Professor Michael
Archer of the Australian Museum, who has travelled to a cattle station where the skeleton was
found.



Although artists have painted what scientists believe would be images of the diprotodon, the
discovery of the complete skeleton will help in revealing more of the creature's shape and
size.



'What we're seeing here is the biggest marsupial (an animal that carries its young in a pouch)
that ever lived in the world - a three-ton monster,' said Professor Archer.



'This here in Queensland was its last stand, judging by the relatively undamaged complete
skeleton.'



Professor Archer said it was unusual for all the bones of ancient creatures to be found in one
place.

Australia and is believed to be 10,000 years old



'All the bones are not necessarily in their right position, but probably the whole skeleton of
this giant is in this one spot where it fell maybe 50,000 years ago.



'There was just one little bone sticking out - and then we found the rest.'



Diprotodons were widespread across Australia when the first indigenous people arrived some
50,000 years ago from what is today South-East Asia.



The heavily-built animals fed on grasses but they might not have been too intelligent -
although having an oversized skull, it was filled with numerous air spaces.



Until the Queensland discovery, the most complete specimen was found at Tambar Springs in New
South Wales.



Scientists were excited to discover that on one rib there was a small square hole, believed to
have been made by a spear while the bone was still fresh.



Now palaeontologists are hoping that more clues about the creature will be found in the
newly-discovered Queensland bones.

Oldest animal with a skeleton discovered

It's 560 million years old and provides a crucial insight into the evolution of life

At between 550 and 560 million years old, an animal discovered in South Australia recently is
the oldest with a skeleton ever found.



The organism, called Coronacollina acula, was found by a team from the University of
California.



The finding provides insight into the evolution of life – particularly, early life – on
the planet, why animals go extinct, and how organisms respond to environmental changes.





Image:
http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/09/article-2112532-1217EF09000005DC-255_634x547.jpg

Rock on: These are the best Coronacollina specimens showing the main body with articulated
spicules



The discovery also can help scientists recognise life elsewhere in the universe.



Coronacollina acula lived on the seafloor. It was shaped like a thimble with at least four 20 to
40-centimetre-long spikes called ’spicules’ attached. These probably held the
creature up.



The researchers believe it ingested food in the same manner a sponge does, and that it was
incapable of moving around. How it reproduced remains a mystery.







Image:
http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/09/article-2112532-1217EF0D000005DC-781_634x286.jpg

How Coronacollina would have appeared in life: It remained in place on the sea floor and may
have used its spicules as support struts



Its age places it in the Ediacaran period, before the explosion of life and diversification of
organisms took place on Earth in the Cambrian, 488 to 542 million years ago.



‘Up until the Cambrian, it was understood that animals were soft bodied and had no hard
parts,’ said Mary Droser, lead researcher and a professor of geology at the University of
California.



‘But we now have an organism with individual skeletal body parts that appears before the
Cambrian. It is therefore the oldest animal with hard parts, and it has a number of them - they
would have been structural supports - essentially holding it up. This is a major innovation
for animals.’



Coronacollina acula is seen in the fossils as a depression measuring a few millimetres to two
centimetres deep. But because rocks compact over time, the organism could have been bigger
– three to five centimetres tall. Notably, it is constructed in the same way that Cambrian
sponges were constructed.



‘It therefore provides a link between the two time intervals,’ Droser said. ‘We're
calling it the “harbinger of Cambrian constructional morphology”, which is to say it's a
precursor of organisms seen in the Cambrian. This is tremendously exciting because it is the
first appearance of one of the major novelties of animal evolution.’



According to Droser, the appearance of Coronacollina acula signals that the initiation of
skeletons was not as sudden in the Cambrian as was thought, and that Ediacaran animals like it
are part of the evolutionary lineage of animals as we know them.



‘The fate of the earliest Ediacaran animals has been a subject of debate, with many
suggesting that they all went extinct just before the Cambrian,’ she said. ‘Our
discovery shows that they did not.’



Results of the study appeared online recently in Geology.

Oldest Skeleton of Human Ancestor Found

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/images/091001-oldest-human-skeleton-ardi-missing-link-chimps-ardipithecus-ramidus_big.jpg

Move over, Lucy. And kiss the missing link goodbye.

Scientists today announced the discovery of the oldest fossil skeleton of a  human
 ancestor. The find reveals that our forebears underwent a previously unknown stage of
evolution more than a million years before  Lucy , the iconic early human ancestor specimen
that walked the Earth 3.2 million years ago.



The centerpiece of a treasure trove of new fossils, the skeleton—assigned to a species
called Ardipithecus ramidus—belonged to a small-brained, 110-pound (50-kilogram)
female nicknamed "Ardi." (See  pictures ofArdipithecus ramidus .)



The fossil puts to rest the notion, popular since Darwin's time, that a  chimpanzee -like
missing link—resembling something between humans and today's apes—would eventually
be found at the root of the human family tree. Indeed, the new evidence suggests that the study
of chimpanzee anatomy and behavior—long used to infer the nature of the earliest human
ancestors—is largely irrelevant to understanding our beginnings.

Skeleton found of man killed by arrowhead 1,000 years ago

THE SKELETON of a young man killed 1,000 years ago by an iron arrowhead found in his skull has
been unearthed by archaeologists in east Galway.



The shallow grave with the man’s body was discovered by a farmer during recent quarrying
work near Newcastle village.



During further examination, the iron arrowhead which claimed his life was retrieved from
inside his skull.



Traces of an underground passage dating from the ninth century have also been identified in
the same section of quarry face in the townland of Tisaxon near Newcastle, according to
archaeologist Martin Fitzpatrick of Arch Consultancy Ltd.



Mr Fitzpatrick’s team was called in after the find was reported to the Department of Arts,
Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Archaeological work was co- funded by that department and the
Department of the Environment.



Mr Fitzpatrick estimated the man was aged between 17 and 25, and may have been buried after a
battle in this esker area. “The fact that he was lying east-west indicates that he was
buried, and it is clear that he had already died of his injury,” he said.



The man was placed on his side in a crouched position. His feet are missing – possibly removed
inadvertently during mechanical excavation or during slippage of the quarry face.



Osteoarchaeologist Caoimhe Tobin confirmed the head wound was inflicted by a small iron
arrowhead of about four centimetres in length, and preliminary analysis suggests it dates
back to the ninth or 10th century.



Mr Fitzpatrick said the passage was the “creep” of a souterrain or underground chamber
used for refuge and storage – often associated with ring forts from the ninth century on.



“While there is no ring fort associated with this souterrain, the ecclesiastical site of
Templemoyle lies to the immediate east,” he said.



Templemoyle has an early ecclesiastical enclosure, a well, church and cemetery.



Since 1952, burials have been uncovered during quarrying for sand and gravel in this
locality. In 1979 a grave slab with the inscription “Oroit ar maelpoil” and a large
bronze-coated iron hand bell dating between the seventh and ninth centuries were
discovered.

Scientists have discovered the remains of what is thought to be one of Britain's first ever
Christians after unearthing an "excessively rare" 1400-year-old Anglo-Saxon burial site
in Cambridgeshire.



Yahoo! UK reports the grave contains the skeletal remains of a 16-year-old female Catholic
lying on an ornamental bed clutching a gold and garnet cross – suggesting she was one of
Britain’s earliest Christians.



Quite how the 16-year-old Anglo Saxon girl died remains a mystery but it is believed that she
was a member of nobility and persuaded to join the Christian faith after the Pope dispatched St
Augustine to England in 597AD.



Dr Sam Lewsey, an expert on the period, told Yahoo! UK: "This is an excessively rare discovery.
It is the most amazing find I have ever encountered.

The 1400-year-old remains of what is thought to be one of Britain's first ever Christians.



"Christian conversion began at the top and percolated down. To be buried in this elaborate
way, with such a valuable artefact, tells us that this girl was probably nobility or even
royalty.



"This cross is the kind of material culture that was in circulation at the highest sphere of
society."

A man with two faces - Edward Mordrake

Image: http://pics.blameitonthevoices.com/072010/two_faces.jpg

The true tale of Edward Mordrake has been lost to history. His unusual case occurred early in
medical history and is referenced only in tales handed down. The tale of his life has become so
muddled through the passage of time that no solid date of birth or death is evident to modern
researchers.

The story always begins the same way. Edward is said be have been heir to one of the noblest
families in England. He was considered a bright and charming man – a scholar, a musician and a
young man in possession of profound grace. He was said to be quite handsome when viewed from the
front – yet, on the back of his head there was a second face, twisted and evil.

In some versions of the story, the second face of Edward is a beautiful girl.This is an
impossibility as all parasitic twins are of the same sex. Often it was said that it possessed
its own intelligence and was quite malignant in its intentions.It has been said that the eyes
would follow spectators and its lips would ‘gibber’ relentlessly and silently.
According to legend it would smile and sneer as Edward wept over his condition.While no voice
was ever audible, Edward swore that often he would be kept awake by the hateful whispers of his
‘evil twin’.

The story has always concluded with young Edward committing suicide at the age of
twenty-three.The method of his death also differs, sometimes poison does him in and in other
versions a bullet ‘between the eyes of his devil-twin’ puts him out of his misery. In both
versions Edward leaves behind a letter requesting that the ‘demon face’ be destroyed
before his burial, ‘lest it continues its dreadful whisperings in my grave.’

Photo via NASA NASA scientists have found the crash site, pictured above, of a spacecraft set
into orbit during the early 60s. This one–thankfully–is not crawling with Decepticons .
They believe it is the missing Lunar Orbiter 2which disappeared back in 1967 during a passage
over the far side of the moon, when the craft went out of telescope and radio range.

Lunar Orbit 2′s primary function was documenting areas of the moon that would be most
hospitable to the Apollo and Surveyor missions. During its run, it returned a total of 609 high
resolution images and 208 medium-sized frames. This includes the Copernicus crater
(pictured below) which is considered by many to be the Picture of the Century.

While the spacecraft was intentionally downed on October 11, 1967, scientists had yet to find
the crash site–til now.

The wreckage is thought to have been located by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) which
is currently mapping the lunar surface in unprecedented detail. During its mission so far,
the spacecraft has gathered more than 192 terabytes of data; that’s nearly 41,000 DVDs
worth of data, images and maps! One of its key findings is our solar system’s coldest spot: a
crater near the moon’s north pole was recorded at minus 415 degrees Fahrenheit. Brrr!

Some of the images LRO has captured can be seen below, but you can also find more here .

Some of the earliest evidence of prehistoric architecture has been discovered in the
Jordanian desert, providing archaeologists with a new perspective on how humans lived
20,000 years ago.

http://www.historyextra.com/sites/default/files/uploads/16765/Jordan%27s%20earliest%20huts---credit%20Lisa%20Maher.jpg

Archaeologists working in eastern Jordan have announced the discovery of 20,000-year-old
hut structures, the earliest yet found in the Kingdom. The finding suggests that the area was
once intensively occupied and that the origins of architecture in the region date back twenty
millennia, before the emergence of agriculture.



Image:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zLPYHm4osZA/T0aFHbTSWEI/AAAAAAAAVPM/oXFYDFFmpug/s400/jordan-excavations_01.jpg
The research, published 15 February, 2012 in PLoS One by a joint British, Danish, American and
Jordanian team, describes huts that hunter-gatherers used as long-term residences and
suggests that many behaviours that have been associated with later cultures and
communities, such as a growing attachment to a location and a far-reaching social network,
existed up to 10,000 years earlier.



Image: http://www.sci-news.com/images/2012/02/image_189_1.jpg Excavations at the
site of Kharaneh IV are providing archaeologists with a new perspective on how humans lived
20,000 years ago. Although the area is starkly dry and barren today, during the last Ice Age the
deserts of Jordan were in bloom, with rivers, streams, and seasonal lakes and ponds providing
a rich environment for hunter-gatherers to settle in.

“What we witness at the site of Kharaneh IV in the Jordanian desert is an enormous
concentration of people in one place,” explained Dr Jay Stock from the Department of
Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Cambridge and co-author of the article.



Image: http://archaeologydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hut.jpg
“People lived here for considerable periods of time when these huts were built. They
exchanged objects with other groups in the region and even buried their dead at the site. These
activities precede the settlements associated with the emergence of agriculture, which
replaced hunting and gathering later on. At Kharaneh IV we have been able to document similar
behaviour a full 10,000 years before agriculture appears on the scene.”

Stone tools discovered in Arabia force archaeologists to rethink human history

 The tools found in southern Arabia date from 125,000 years ago – 55,000 years before
humans were thought to have left Africa





Image:
http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/1/27/1296149453341/stone-tools-flints--005.jpg

A spectacular haul of stone tools discovered beneath a collapsed rock shelter in southern
Arabia has forced a major rethink of the story of human migration out of Africa. The collection
of hand axes and other tools shaped to cut, pierce and scrape bear the hallmarks of early human
workmanship, but date from 125,000 years ago, around 55,000 years before our ancestors were
thought to have left the continent.

The artefacts, uncovered in the United Arab Emirates, point to a much earlier dispersal of
ancient humans, who probably cut across from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian peninsula via a
shallow channel in the Red Sea that became passable at the end of an ice age. Once established,
these early pioneers may have pushed on across the Persian Gulf, perhaps reaching as far as
India, Indonesia and eventually Australia.

Michael Petraglia, an archaeologist at Oxford University who was not involved in the work,
told the Science journal: "This is really quite spectacular. It breaks the back of the current
consensus view."

Anatomically modern humans – those that resemble people alive today – evolved in Africa
about 200,000 years ago. Until now, most archaeological evidence has supported an exodus
from Africa, or several waves of migration, along the Mediterranean coast or the Arabian
shoreline between 80,000 and 60,000 years ago.

A team led by Hans-Peter Uerpmann at the University of TÃŒbingen in Germany uncovered the
latest stone tools while excavating sediments at the base of a collapsed overhang set in a
limestone mountain called Jebel Faya, about 35 miles (55km) from the Persian Gulf coast.
Previous excavations at the site have found artefacts from the iron, bronze and neolithic
periods, evidence that the rocky formation has provided millennia of natural shelter for
humans.

The array of tools include small hand axes and two-sided blades that are remarkably similar to
those fashioned by early humans in east Africa. The researchers tentatively ruled out the
possibility of other hominins having made the tools, such as the Neanderthals that already
occupied Europe and north Asia, as they were not in Arabia at the time.

The stones, a form of silica-rich rock called chert, were dated by Simon Armitage, a
researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London , using a technique that measured how long
sand grains around the artefacts had been buried. Another strand of the archaeologists'
work, described in Science , focused on climate change records and historical sea levels in
the area. They show that between 200,000 and 130,000 years ago, a global ice age caused sea
levels to fall by up to 100 metres, while the Saharan and Arabian deserts expanded into vast,
inhospitable wastelands.

Ancient City of Akrotiri (Santorini)

http://www.travelingclassroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/5_akro_art_concept.jpg
Akrotiri is the name of an excavation site of a Minoan Bronze Age settlement on the Greek island
of Santorini, associated with the Minoan civilization due to inscriptions in Linear A, and
close similarities in artifact and fresco styles. The excavation is named for a modern Greek
village situated on a hill nearby. The name of the site in antiquity is unknown.

Akrotiri was buried by the widespread Theran eruption in the middle of the second
millenniumBC (during the Late Minoan IA period); as a result, like the Roman ruins of Pompeii
after it, it is remarkably well-preserved. Frescoes, pottery, furniture, advanced
drainage systems and three-story buildings have been discovered at the site, whose
excavation was started in 1967 bySpyridon Marinatos.



Image: http://www.noisypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Akrotiri-1.jpg Certain
historians hold this settlement, as well as the disaster that left it unknown to most of
history, as the inspiration behind Plato's story of Atlantis, as mentioned in his dialogues
Timaeusand Critias. Excavated artifacts have been installed in a museum distant from the
site (Museum of Prehistoric Thera), with many objects and artworks presented. Only a single
gold object has been found, hidden beneath flooring, and no uninterred human skeletal
remains have been found. This indicates that an orderly evacuation was performed with little
or no loss of life.





Image:
http://www.santorini-hotels.info/images/guide/akrotiri/santorini-akrotiri.jpg An
ambitious modern roof structure, meant to protect the site, collapsed just prior to its
completion in 2005, killing one visitor. No damages were recorded to the antiquities. As a
result of this, the site was closed to visitors. As of 2011, it was still closed, with a new roof
yet to be built.

The Palace in the Cliff

The year was 1888 and the month was December. Two cowboys, Charlie Mason and Richard
Wetherill, rode through the falling snow of southwest Colorado looking for stray cattle.
They soon came to the edge of a rocky canyon. Looking down into it they made an amazing
discovery. On the other side of the canyon was an immense cave cut into the cliff wall, and
inside that cave was what looked like a palace. It was the lost city of Mesa Verde we now call
Cliff Palace.



Image: http://www.terragalleria.com/images/np-plateau/meve0796.jpeg Mesa Verde
means "Green Table" in Spanish and it is an appropriate name. This part of Colorado is a flat
tableland some 20 miles long and 18 miles wide. The top is some 2,000 feet higher than the
surrounding land. To the south the Mesa is cut by some 20 canyons which contain over 500 hundred
Indian ruins, of which Cliff Palace is the largest.





Archaeologists estimate that the native Americans who built Cliff Palace arrived in Mesa
Verde as early as 1 A.D. They apparently lived a quiet and peaceful life on the Mesa tops until
about 1200 A.D. when suddenly they abandoned their towns and built new ones in caves on the
cliff faces. Why? Probably for security. The caves were large (the cave at Cliff Palace is
one-hundred feet deep and three-hundred feet wide) and gave protection from the sun, rain,
snow and human enemies.

Cliff Palace has over two-hundred rooms and some parts are three stories high. It probably
housed around 400 people. Though the residents lived in the cave, they commuted to the Mesa top
to work their agricultural fields.

Around 1280, though, the Indians suddenly abandoned their cliff dwellings and moved away.
There is no sign that they were forced out by war, so what could have made the residents leave
their new cities barely 80 years after they had been built?

In this case scientists think they have found the answer in the trees of the Mesa. When a tree is
cut down, the cross section shows a series of concentric rings. One new ring is laid down each
year. By counting the rings it is possible to tell the age of the tree. By looking at the width of
the ring it is possible to tell how much a tree grew in any particular year.

By examining trees, scientists have been able to determine that a severe drought hit the Mesa
around 1276 and lasted 24 years. This affected the residents food supply and they were forced
to move. They apparently went south and mixed with the Pueblo Indians that live there even to
this day. Many items were still in the rooms at Cliff Palace and it is likely that the residents
intended to return at the end of the drought. They never came back, though, and all that is left
of their culture is the silent cities in the Mesa Verde cliffs.

Ancient City of Mohenjo Daro

http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/247/cache/lost-city-mohenjo-daro-pakistan_24712_600x450.jpg



The Indus Valley civilization was entirely unknown until 1921, when excavations in what
would become Pakistan revealed the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro (shown here).

This mysterious culture emerged nearly 4,500 years ago and thrived for a thousand years,
profiting from the highly fertile lands of the Indus River floodplain and trade with the
civilizations of nearby Mesopotamia.





Image: http://www.creativeuncut.com/gallery-09/art/ao-mohenjo-daro.jpg A
well-planned street grid and an elaborate drainage system hint that the occupants of the
ancient Indus civilization city of Mohenjo Daro were skilled urban planners with a reverence
for the control of water. But just who occupied the ancient city in modern-day Pakistan during
the third millennium B.C. remains a puzzle.

"It's pretty faceless," says Indus expert Gregory Possehl of the University of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia.







Image: http://www.sewerhistory.org/images/w/wam/har_wam02.jpg The city lacks
ostentatious palaces, temples, or monuments. There's no obvious central seat of government
or evidence of a king or queen. Modesty, order, and cleanliness were apparently preferred.
Pottery and tools of copper and stone were standardized. Seals and weights suggest a system of
tightly controlled trade.

The city's wealth and stature is evident in artifacts such as ivory, lapis, carnelian, and
gold beads, as well as the baked-brick city structures themselves.

A watertight pool called the Great Bath, perched on top of a mound of dirt and held in place with
walls of baked brick, is the closest structure Mohenjo Daro has to a temple. Possehl, a
National Geographic grantee, says it suggests an ideology based on cleanliness

Wells were found throughout the city, and nearly every house contained a bathing area and
drainage system.



Image:
http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2008/image08/080321mohenjodaro_copy%281%29.jpg
City of Mounds Archaeologists first visited Mohenjo Daro in 1911. Several excavations
occurred in the 1920s through 1931. Small probes took place in the 1930s, and subsequent digs
occurred in 1950 and 1964.

The ancient city sits on elevated ground in the modern-day Larkana district of Sindh province
in Pakistan.

During its heyday from about 2500 to 1900 B.C. the city was among the most important to the Indus
civilization, Possehl says. It spread out over about 250 acres (100 hectares) on a series of
mounds, and the Great Bath and an associated large building occupied the tallest mound.

According to University of Wisconsin, Madison, archaeologist Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, also a
National Geographic grantee, the mounds grew organically over the centuries as people kept
building platforms and walls for their houses.

"Gradually you have a high promontory on which people are living," he says.

With no evidence of kings or queens, Mohenjo Daro was likely governed as a city-state, perhaps
by elected officials or elites from each of the mounds.



Image: http://web.singnet.com.sg/~thiens/great%20bath.jpg Prized Artifacts A
miniature bronze statuette of a nude female, known as the dancing girl, was celebrated by
archaeologists when it was discovered in 1926, Kenoyer notes.

Of greater interest to him, though, are a few stone sculptures of seated male figures, such as
the intricately carved and colored Priest King, so called even though there is no evidence he
was a priest or king.

The sculptures were all found broken, Kenoyer says. "Whoever came in at the very end of the
Indus period clearly didn't like the people who were representing themselves or their
elders," he says.

Just what ended the Indus civilization—and Mohenjo Daro—is also a mystery.

Kenoyer suggests that the Indus River changed course, which would have hampered the local
agricultural economy and the city's importance as a center of trade.



Image:
http://www.imagesofasia.com/html/mohenjodaro/images/large/mohenjodaro-seal.jpg
But no evidence exists that flooding destroyed the city, and the city wasn't totally
abandoned, Kenoyer says. And, Possehl says, a changing river course doesn't explain the
collapse of the entire Indus civilization. Throughout the valley, the culture changed, he
says.

"It reaches some kind of obvious archaeological fruition about 1900 B.C.," he said. "What
drives that, nobody knows."

What do a city built in the second century A.D., archeological adventurers and city planners
have in common; the ancient city of Timgad. This ancient city that was built by the Romans using
the grid plan (the streets are set at a right angle to one another) that is now in use in almost
every major city in the world. It also boasts some of the best preserved examples of Roman
architecture that were built by the emperor Trajan.



Image:
http://help.berberber.com/members/redaiwa/albums/algerie-feerique/4755-ruines-romaines-timgad-1.jpg
Around 100 A.D the city of Timgad (Thamugas by the Romans) was founded and built for members of
the Roman army who performed rightly in their duties and were thus granted land for the years of
service. The town possessed the modern conveniences of the day. A library, 4 bath houses and
open-air theater are still in remarkable shape. As one walks the land today the grid plan of six
intersecting roads are still visible.



Image:
http://michel.bousigniere.pagesperso-orange.fr/Ph.%20Dumoulin/Timgad%20carte%20postale.jpg
In the 7th century the town was destroyed by the Berbers and over time became buried by the
Saharan sands and because of this some of the ruins are still in extraordinary preservation.
When visiting Timgad, you can still see the bath houses, library and Trajan's Triumphal Arch
still holds the entrance for the adventurous wanderer. The theater is still in such good shape
that performances are still held there.



Image:
http://www.historvius.com/images/original/643-Timgad-Amphitheatre-643-E.jpg As
with all adventure travel through areas of great ruin preservation, proceed with care and
caution. Remember this area is part of the Saharan desert and the elements can change in a
hurry. Best to hire a guide and of course bring plenty of water while you travel back to a time
that still makes every city planner proud of their profession.

Ancient City of Machu Picchu

Image: http://www.bestsingletravel.com/images/machu-picchu.jpg The ruins of Machu
Picchu, rediscovered in 1911 by Yale archaeologist Hiram Bingham, are one of the most
beautiful and enigmatic ancient sites in the world. While the Inca people certainly used the
Andean mountain top (9060 feet elevation), erecting many hundreds of stone structures from
the early 1400's, legends and myths indicate that Machu Picchu (meaning 'Old Peak' in the
Quechua language) was revered as a sacred place from a far earlier time. Whatever its origins,
the Inca turned the site into a small (5 square miles) but extraordinary city. Invisible from
below and completely self-contained, surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to
feed the population, and watered by natural springs, Machu Picchu seems to have been utilized
by the Inca as a secret ceremonial city. Two thousand feet above the rumbling Urubamba river,
the cloud shrouded ruins have palaces, baths, temples, storage rooms and some 150 houses, all
in a remarkable state of preservation. These structures, carved from the gray granite of the
mountain top are wonders of both architectural and aesthetic genius. Many of the building
blocks weigh 50 tons or more yet are so precisely sculpted and fitted together with such
exactitude that the mortarless joints will not permit the insertion of even a thin knife
blade. Little is known of the social or religious use of the site during Inca times. The
skeletal remains of ten females to one male had led to the casual assumption that the site may
have been a sanctuary for the training of priestesses and /or brides for the Inca nobility.
However, subsequent osteological examination of the bones revealed an equal number of male
bones, thereby indicating that Machu Picchu was not exclusively a temple or dwelling place of
women.



Image: http://www.crystalinks.com/incatrail.jpg One of Machu Picchu's primary
functions was that of astronomical observatory. The Intihuatana stone (meaning 'Hitching
Post of the Sun') has been shown to be a precise indicator of the date of the two equinoxes and
other significant celestial periods. The Intihuatana (also called the Saywa or Sukhanka
stone) is designed to hitch the sun at the two equinoxes, not at the solstice (as is stated in
some tourist literature and new-age books). At midday on March 21st and September 21st, the
sun stands almost directly above the pillar, creating no shadow at all. At this precise moment
the sun "sits with all his might upon the pillar" and is for a moment "tied" to the rock. At these
periods, the Incas held ceremonies at the stone in which they "tied the sun" to halt its
northward movement in the sky. There is also an Intihuatana alignment with the December
solstice (the summer solstice of the southern hemisphere), when at sunset the sun sinks
behind Pumasillo (the Puma's claw), the most sacred mountain of the western Vilcabamba
range, but the shrine itself is primarily equinoctial.



Image:
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ra2fZ_Ebbhw/Tgqv-kfMe8I/AAAAAAAAAWc/WnwhTxRoE9U/s400/machu+terraces.jpg
Shamanic legends tell that when a sensitive person touches their forehead to the Intihuatana
stone it opens their vision to the spirit world. Intihuatana stones were the supremely sacred
objects of the Inca people and were systematically searched for and destroyed by the
Spaniards. When the Intihuatana stone was broken at an Inca shrine, the Inca believed that the
deities of the place died or departed. The Spaniards never found Machu Picchu, even though
they suspected its existence, thus the Intihuatana stone and its resident spirits remain in
their original position. The mountain top sanctuary fell into disuse and was abandoned some
forty years after the Spanish took Cuzco in 1533. Supply lines linking the many Inca social
centers were disrupted and the great empire came to an end. The photograph shows the ruins of
Machu Picchu in the foreground with the sacred peak of Wayna Picchu towering behind. Partway
down the northern side of Wayna Picchu is the so-called "Temple of the Moon" inside a cavern. As
with the ruins of Machu Picchu, there is no archaeological or iconographical evidence to
substantiate the "new-age" assumption that this cave was a goddess site.



Image: http://www.monuments.ws/upload/machu-picchu-2.jpg Although Hiram Bingham was
the first person to bring word of the ruins to the outside world in 1911, other outsiders were
said to have seen Machu Picchu before him. The site may have been discovered in 1867 by a German
businessman, Augusto Berns, and there is some evidence that another German, J. M. von Hassel,
arrived even earlier. Maps found by historians show references to Machu Picchu as early as
1874. In 1904, an engineer named Franklin supposedly spotted the ruins from a distant
mountain.





The INCA and their History



Image: http://htmlhelp.com/~liam/Peru/Cusco/MachuPicchu/MachuPicchu.jpg At the time
of Columbus’ landfall on the New World, the greatest empire on earth was that of the Inca.
Called Tawantinsuyu or ‘Land of the Four Quarters,’ it spanned more than 4300 miles along
the mountains and coastal deserts of central South America. The vast empire stretched from
central Chile to present Ecuador-Colombia border and included most of Peru, Bolivia,
Ecuador, northern Chile and northwestern Argentina (this is a land area equal to the entire
portion of the United States from Maine to Florida east of the Appalachians). It exceeded in
size any medieval or contemporary European nation and equaled the longitudinal expanse of
the Roman Empire. Yet for all its greatness, Tawantinsuyu existed for barely a century.



Image:
http://members.pcug.org.au/~alanlevy/Thumbnails/Images/Peru/HuaynaPicchu.JPG The
origins of the Inca are shrouded in mystery and mythology. According to their own mythology,
the Inca began when Manco Capac and his sister, Mama Occlo, rose out of Lake Titicaca, having
been created by the Sun and the Moon as divine founders of a chosen people. Manco Capac and his
sister then went off with a golden rod to find a suitable location to found a great city. Through
a series of adventures, geomantic resonances, and astronomical correspondences, the site
of Cuzco was chosen.



Image: http://www.sacredsites.com/americas/peru/images/road-aguas-500.jpg
Archaeological research, on the other hand, indicates that the pre-imperial Inca were
simply one of a number of petty tribes in the south central region of Peru. From roughly 1200 AD
to the early 1400’s, the Inca engaged in numerous battles with local rivals, but never
achieved supremacy over any of them. Around 1438, however, the Inca emperor Viracocha and his
son, Pachakuti, defeated a powerful rival, the Chankas. From this time the empire building
era of the Inca began. Other rival tribes around the Cuzco area were soon united and campaigns
were launched into the Titicaca basin and beyond. During the ensuing reigns of the emperors
Pachakuti, and Topa Inca the Inca armies expanded the frontiers of Tawantinsuyu from
southern Columbia to central Chile.

In the few short years before their overthrow by the Spanish in 1532, the Inca developed one of
the largest and most sophisticated empires in the entire pre-industrial world. (In
discussing Inca achievements, however, it is important to state that they were not the
singular invention of a few inspired emperors but rather the ultimate elaboration of
numerous pan-Andean institutions.) The Inca accomplished their phenomenal growth through
a mixture of diplomacy and warfare, and a sociopolitical management system based on highly
effective taxation and the dependable provision of goods and services to the peoples of their
realm.



Image:
http://www.7travelblog.info/var/albums/Peru---Cusco-and-Machu-Picchu-ruins/Peru%20-%20Cusco%20and%20Machu%20Picchu%20ruins%20%289%29.jpg?m=1308213943
As the Inca began to expand their territories, the first step was to seek alliances with tribes
upon the frontiers. Copious gifts of textiles, exotic products from distant regions, and
wives to add blood ties to the alliances were offered to the chiefs of these tribes. Quite
frequently these gifts were readily accepted (certainly the intimidating specter of the
powerful Inca armies assisted in this process), but if certain tribes proved recalcitrant,
the Inca simply overwhelmed them with superior military power.



Image: http://0.tqn.com/d/archaeology/1/0/f/B/machu_picchu7.jpg In either case, the
tribes were then incorporated into larger administrative units and political provinces.
This strategy left Tawantinsuyu with more than 80 political provinces, each with different
ethnic and linguistic characteristics. To address these regional differences the Inca
imposed there own tongue, Quechua, as the language of the realm and the medium of governmental
communication. Additionally, the Inca frequently moved entire populations around their
realm, putting loyal groups into troublesome areas, and transferring recalcitrant tribes
to loyal areas. These wholesale transfers of people were also used to introduce weavers and
farmers, stone workers and artisans into areas where these skills were needed.



Image:
http://images.travelpod.com/users/kateandchris/peru-chile08.1204783740.ruins_and_machu_picchu_mountain.jpg
Inca statecraft, a system of truly extraordinary efficiency, was founded upon the ancient,
pan-Andean concept of reciprocity. Goods and services moved from the local area to regional
and state warehouses and were then redistributed back to the populace in several important
ways. The state economy was based, not on currency systems, but on extracting taxes in the form
of labor. There were three primary forms to this taxation: agricultural levies on local
community-managed lands; a labor service required of able-bodied males that provided for
monumental construction projects and military campaigns; and the textile production
required of women, children and older men. The goods and services gathered in these ways were
then divided into three shares. The first third went to support Inti (the Sun god), other gods
in the state pantheon, and a wide variety of ceremonial activities. The second portion went to
support the Inca emperor and the construction and military projects he initiated. The third
portion was redistributed to the common people in the form of food, textiles, lavish
festivals, and military protection.



Image: http://www.delange.org/MachuPicchu4/mp.jpg The most visible, and remaining,
examples of Inca genius are to be found in their monumental construction projects: in the form
of roads, agricultural terraces, and administrative and ceremonial structures. The vast
empire was united by an extensive and superbly efficient highway system. Two parallel
highways, one along the coast and the other in the high mountains, ran north-south from one end
of the empire to the other. Between these two major highways ran dozens of east-west roads
linking the coasts, mountains, and jungles. Altogether there were more than 30,000
kilometers of these roads, the majority of which were beautifully paved, well drained, and
equipped with storage houses, travelers’ lodges, and military posts. The produce of the
empire moved efficiently along these roads, transported by hardy llamas strung together in
caravans of a thousand or more animals. Furthermore, along the roads sped the most rapid
communication system ever developed in the pre-industrial world; in the form of a constant
movement of fleet-footed runners.



Image: http://www.machupicchu-inca.com/images/Explain-Machu-Picchu.jpg To feed the
people in their swiftly growing empire, the Inca terraced great areas of mountain land,
transported rich soils to the terraces, employed highly sophisticated irrigation systems,
and experimented with a variety of crops. These monumental landscaping projects, called
andenes in the Quechua language, so impressed the colonial Spanish that they named the Andes
mountains after them (recent satellite photography has shown that these Inca terraces
covered more land than is currently cultivated in the central Andean nations).



Image: http://www.nickbuxton.info/photos/peru/img_0155.JPG In their administrative
and even more so, their ceremonial centers, the Inca most clearly displayed their brilliance
with design and construction. Great surviving centers such as Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Machu
Picchu, and Cuzco, the Inca capital, are well known examples. In these places the Inca
fashioned monumental architecture equal in beauty to any culture of the old world. Massive,
multi-sided blocks were precisely fitted together in interlocking patterns in order to
withstand the disastrous effects of earth quakes (in an earthquake, the stones on Inca
terrace walls lock together, allowing the entire wall to simultaneously flex and cohere).
Both secular and sacred architecture had spacious windows, niches for idols, and other
purely artistic sculptural elaborations. Splashing fountains abounded and masterpieces
of hydraulic engineering brought fresh water into buildings, while other channels removed
wastes.



Image: http://www.planetware.com/i/photo/machu-picchu-ruins-per724.jpg The Incas
never used the wheel in any practical manner. Its use in toys demonstrates that the principle
was well-known to them, although it was not applied in their engineering. The lack of strong
draft animals, as well as steep terrain and dense vegetation issues, may have rendered the
wheel impractical. How they moved and placed the enormous blocks of stones remains a mystery,
although the general belief is that they used hundreds of men to push the stones up inclined
planes. A few of the stones still have knobs on them that could have been used to lever them into
position.



Image: http://www.planetware.com/i/photo/machu-picchu-ruins-per085.jpg It must be
noted, however, that the places mentioned above, Pisac, Ollantaytambo and Machu Picchu in
particular, are known to have been ceremonial sites many centuries and even millennia before
the Inca developed and, furthermore, already had existing structures that were used for
astronomical observations and ceremonial functions. Many contemporary people writing and
speaking about the Inca are not well enough educated to know this matter yet, none the less, it
is archaeological fact.

The name of the archaeological site Machu Picchu is sometimes misspelled as machu pichu,
macchu picchu, machu piccu, machupicchu, macu picchu, macho picchu, machu piccho, machu
picch, macha picchu, machu piccuh, mach picchu. The correct spelling is Machu Picchu.

Ancient City of Sanchi

Image: http://daphne.palomar.edu/mhudelson/WorksofArt/31Buddhist/5508.jpg The most
elaborate and well known of the more than 50 magnificent Buddhist monuments that crown the
hilltop of Sanchi, India, is Stupa Number One or the Great Stupa. It is part of an entire complex
of structures, mostly stupas, built between the 3rd Century BCE and the 12th Century AD. The
stupa is not a building in any traditional sense. Once a burial or reliquary mound, the stupa
has become a purely symbolic object.

SANCHI

Image:
http://goodearthguides.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/sanchi-great-stupa.jpg?w=645
Sanchi is 68 kilometers north of Bhopal in the state of Madhya Pradesh. It is unique, not only
for having the most perfect and well preserved stupas, but also for offering the visitor a
chance to see, in one location, the genesis, flowering, and decay of Buddhist art and
architecture during a period of about 1500 years -- almost covering the entire range of Indian
Buddhism. This is surprising since Sanchi was not hallowed by any incident in Buddha's life
nor was it the focus of any significant event in the history of Buddhism.



Image: http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/1904918.jpg Proximity to a city
was of importance for Buddhist monasteries as the monks were obliged to go begging for half of
every day. The religious duties that filled the other half day made it difficult to situate a
monastery in a noisy town. For this reason large monastic communities sought a situation
outside a city or on a busy trade route. The Emperor Ashoka saw Sanchi as an ideal place to give
shape to his newly aroused zeal for Buddhism. It has always been a quiet, meditative place that
was, meanwhile, located near the very prosperous city of Vidisha. The success of the Buddhist
settlement was due in great measure to the piety of the rich, mercantile community of the
nearby city.



Image: http://www.shunya.net/Pictures/NorthIndia/Sanchi/SanchiStupas49.jpg THE
"ARCHITECT" Ashoka Maurya (273 - 236 BCE) was the most famous of the Buddhist rulers of India. A
dozen years or so after he began his reign, about 258 BCE, he became a convert to Buddhism. He was
a great administrator and a great builder. His empire encompassed the whole of India and
Afghanistan. Ashoka's reign of paternal despotism has been compared to that of Constantine
or Cromwell. With tireless energy he personally supervised all the affairs of government for
40 years.



Image:
http://personal.carthage.edu/jlochtefeld/buddhism/sanchi/ngextsravasti05.jpg His
doctrine was less concerned with the analytic aspects of Buddhism and dwelled exclusively on
ethics. He dispatched missionaries to other parts of India as well as Ceylon, Syria, Egypt,
Cyrene, Macedonia, and Epirus. It is due to Ashoka that Buddhism became, and long remained,
the predominant religion of India.

The foundation of this important center at Sanchi was laid by the Emperor Ashoka when he built a
stupa and erected a monolithic pillar here. Ashoka built a total of eight stupas on the hilltop
of Sanchi including the Great Stupa. A great number of stupas and other religious structures
were added over the succeeding centuries.

With the decline of Buddhism, the site decayed and was eventually completely forgotten. But,
between 1912 and 1919, the structures were carefully repaired to their present condition and
restored.



Image: http://www.rainbowskill.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/d11.jpg THE STUPA The
stupa is the most characteristic monument of Buddhist India. Originally stupas were mounds
covering the relics of the Buddha or his followers. In its earliest stages Buddhist art didn't
represent the Buddha directly. Instead, his presence was alluded to through symbols such as
the bo tree, the wheel of law or his footprint. The stupa also became a symbol of the Buddha. More
exactly, it became a symbol of his final release from the cycle of birth and rebirth --
theParinirvana or the "Final Dying."

In a larger sense the stupa is also a cosmic symbol. Its hemispherical shape represents the
world egg. Stupas commonly rest on a square pedestal and are carefully aligned with the four
cardinal points of the compass. This is a recurrence of the symbolism of the dome whereby Earth
supports Heaven and Heaven covers Earth. The axis of the world is always represented in the
stupa, rising above its summit. The so-called "parasols," set one above the other along the
shaft emerging from its uppermost region, represent a heavenly hierarchy. The cosmic
symbolism is completed by a ritual circumambulatory path around the monument.



Image: http://asi.nic.in/IMAGES/wh_sanchi/sanchi002.jpg Stupas are large-scale
memorials built in particularly holy places. Generally they enshrine relics of some sort. As
a building type the stupa is the forerunner of the pagoda. However, the stupa has also come to be
known, on a smaller scale, as the reliquary itself and can be made of crystal, gold, silver or
other precious metals.

The Great Stupa of Sanchi underwent a complete reconstruction after wanton damage inflicted
upon it in the middle of the second century BCE. The reconstruction consisted of a stone
casing, a terrace with a double flight of steps, balustrades, a paved processional path and an
umbrella and railing -- all built of sandstone. Four elaborately carved gateways were added
in the first century BCE.

The last addition took place during the rule of the Guptas, sometime before 450 AD. By now
effigies of the Buddha were permitted and four stone Buddhas were placed against the walls of
the stupa facing the gates. Their haloes are elaborately carved.
