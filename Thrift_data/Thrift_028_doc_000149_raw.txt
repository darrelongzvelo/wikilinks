“Confide In Me” was the first single from Australian singer Kylie Minogue ‘s
homonymous album, released in September 1994. It was written by Steve Anderson , Dave Seaman
and Owain Barton . It was produced by the first two who as a team were Brothers in Rhythm , and
received good overall reception.

The single peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and spent five weeks at number one in
Australia . The song became a modest dance club hit in the United States , peaking at number
thirty-nine on the Billboard Dance/Club Play Chart in 1994. “Confide in Me” won three
ARIA Music Awards in Australia for Best Selling Australian Single, Best Video and Best
Selling Australian Dance Track in 1994. The song also placed seventh for Best Single and third
for Best Video at the 1994 Smash Hits Awards.

Two songs were released as B-sides to the commercial single release of “Confide in Me”:
“Nothing Can Stop Us”, written by Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs and produced by Saint Etienne
, was considered as Minogue’s Deconstruction single debut, but was withdrawn. “If You
Don’t Love Me”, a cover of the Prefab Sprout song, was written by Paddy MacAloon and
produced by Steve Anderson.

There was a second “Confide In Me” Australia CD single, baring catalog number D11815. It
included the Master Mix along with both b-sides. In 2000, “If You Don’t Love Me” was
included on the budget compilation Hits+ .

The original version (Master Mix on this single) has a synth sound similar to that on “The
Beast Within Mix” of Madonna’s “Justify My Love”. Click here to compare them.

The Master Mix and Big Brothers Mix were the work of Steve Anderson and Dave Seaman. Anderson
has a long collaborative relationship with Minogue, he has been musical director on her tours
for at least ten years now.

Seaman is among the pioneers of house music, frequently invited to prestigious electronic
music events such as Creamfields . His collaboration with Minogue is an example of many who
started their careers producing or remixing pop artists to then embark on a successful live DJ
career. The collaboration of David Morales / Satoshie Tomiie with Mariah Carey in the 90′s
is another one.

The Truth Mix of “Confide In Me” was remixed by Diego Maradonna (I guess an ardent fan of the
soccer player and the singer?) and Jonny Dollar, one of the main players in the history of
trip-hop in the ’90s. He co-produced the entire “Blue Lines” album with Massive
Attack. Dollar died of cancer at age 45 on May 28, 2009.

This mini album of remixes was released in the UK in 1992, and is part of the “Twelve Inch
Mixes” series. As with several Sony releases for the European market, it was manufactured
in Austria.Â  It features four extended mixes of singles off the 1986 “Different
Light” album and one from the 1988 “Everything” album:

“Manic Monday” was the first hit single for The Bangles . Production was in charge of David
Kahne . It was written by Prince in 1984 and recorded as a duet for the Apollonia 6 album, but the
song was eventually pulled. Two years later, as he was attempting to “court” singer
Susanna Hoffs of the band The Bangles, Prince, using the pseudonym Christopher, offered the
song to them to record their version. The song reached #2 in both the UK and US record charts,
coincidentally behind Prince’s own song “ Kiss “, which reached #1 in the US.

“If She Knew What She Wants” was the second single from “Different Light”, produced
by David Kahne . It was a cover, originally penned and released by Jules Shear on his 1985 “The
Eternal Return” album . The song was originally written in the first person, essentially a
love song, but the Bangles rewrote the lyrics in the third person, rather than change the
subject’s gender. The Bangles version reached twenty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and at
number thirty-one on the UK Singles Chart .

“Walk Like An Egyptian ” was the third single and their first number one song on the
Billboard Hot 100. Liam Sternberg wrote the song after seeing people on a ferry walking
awkwardly to keep their balance, which reminded him of figures in Ancient Egyptian reliefs .
Sternberg offered his song to Toni Basil , who turned it down. David Kahne , the producer of
Different Light , took the song to The Bangles who agreed to record it. Kahne had each member of
the group sing the lyrics to determine who would sing each verse, with Susanna Hoffs , Vicki
Peterson and Michael Steele each singing lead vocals on a verse in the final version.

“Walking Down Your Street” was the fourth and final single in the US it reached number
eleven on the Hot 100 chart in April 1987. It was written by Louis Guitterez , Susanna Hoffs and
producer David Kahne – making it the Bangles’ first in a string of US Top 40 hits written by
at least one band member. The video boasts appearances by Randy Quaid and Little Richard .

“In Your Room” was the first single off the “Everything” album. It was written by
Susanna Hoffs, Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg (the latter two wrote a string of hits like
“True Colors”, “Like A Virgin”, and “Eternal Flame”). Produced by Davitt
Sigerson . It reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1989.

Tone-LÅ�c – Wild Thing (US CD Maxi-Single)

http://steptothebeat.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/tone-loc-wild-thing1.jpg?w=550

“Wild Thing” was the first single from Tone-LÅ�c’s “Loc’ed After Dark”
album. The song was a big hit in the US, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on
February 18, 1989. The album became the second rap release ever to top the pop charts.

The song was co-written by Marvin Young , better known as Young MC , and was produced by The Dust
Brothers , who would later go on to produce albums by the Beastie Boys and Beck .

“Wild Thing” contains an uncredited sample of Van Halen ‘s “ Jamie’s Cryin’ “.
Van Halen’s management at the time asked for a flat fee (credited in some reports to be
USD$5,000) as payment to have the song sampled by Tone LÅ�c. Apparently, this decision was
taken without consulting the band’s original members (credited as co-authors of the
song), who in turn did not expect Wild Thing to become the major hit it became. A subsequent
civil lawsuit was settled out of court, with the band receiving USD$180,000 as settlement
payment. Alex Van Halen has gone on record saying that he had heard the song over the radio
halfway and not realizing it had been sampled until he recognized his (by now famous) tom-tom
break at least a few times. Concerning the settlement, he said: “Well, at least we got
something. Tone LÅ�c and his people made millions out of it…”

Sample aside, if you listen to the guitars, still very familiar! Click here to listen to an
excerpt of both tracks.

A music video was made for the song at a reported cost of only $500, copying the style of Robert
Palmer ‘s “ Addicted to Love ” with mini-skirted women playing guitars next to Tone
LÅ�c, which went into heavy rotation on MTV .

Tone-LÅ�c expanded his horizons into acting in 1992 and 1993, appearing a few times on the
Fox sitcom Roc. He was also in the films “Posse” and “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective”.

In 2008, DJ Paul V. created a great mash-up of “Wild Thing” with Madonna’s “Give It 2
Me”. Click here to listen.

Phil Collins – In The Air Tonight (Japan CD Maxi-Single)

“In The Air Tonight” was the first single off his debut 1981 solo debut album “Face
Value”. It had moderate sucess in the USA, peaking at 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, but a
big hit in most parts of the world.Â  The track was penned by Collins and produced by himself
and long time collaborator Hugh Padgham .

An urban legend has arisen around “In the Air Tonight”. According to it, the lyrics are
based on a tragic event Collins witnessed, usually a drowning (as in the song’s lyrics), in
which a man could have helped the victim (sometimes said to be Phil’s brother), but did not do
so. An alternate version of the legend has the onlooker a murderer , intentionally drowning
the victim, rather than a bystander. A common ending is that Collins invites this man to a show
and sings the song to him, often with a spotlight pointed at him. Afterward, the man is arrested
or, in some versions, is wracked with guilt and has a heart attack or commits suicide . Other
versions of the story involve Collins discovering his wife having sex with (or being raped by)
another man, often a close friend; the man subsequently drowns while Collins himself
watches.

Years later, Collins commented on the legends about the song in a BBC World Service interview:
“ I don’t know what this song is about. When I was writing this I was going through a divorce.
And the only thing I can say about it is that it’s obviously in anger. It’s the angry side, or
the bitter side of a separation. So what makes it even more comical is when I hear these stories
which started many years ago, particularly in America, of someone come up to me and say, ‘Did
you really see someone drowning?’ I said, ‘No, wrong’. And then every time I go back to
America the story gets Chinese whispers , it gets more and more elaborate. It’s so
frustrating, ‘cos this is one song out of all the songs probably that I’ve ever written
that I really don’t know what it’s about, you know.”

Whitney Houston – I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) (US Promo CD Maxi-Single)

“I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)” is the first single from Whitney Houston’s
second studio album Whitney . It was produced by Narada Michael Walden , and written by George
Merrill and Shannon Rubicam of the band Boy Meets Girl , who had previously written the
number-one Whitney Houston hit “ How Will I Know “. The original arrangement was more of a
country tune but was transformed to make it a dance song by Walden.

The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on June 27 , 1987 (the same day that
Houston’s album Whitney debuted at number one, the first time ever by a female artist), and
remained there for two weeks. It remained in the top forty of the Hot 100 for fourteen weeks, and
was ranked fourth on the Year-End Chart.

The song reached number one on the Hot 100 Single Sales chart for two weeks, and on the Hot 100
Airplay chart for three weeks, Houston’s longest run at that time. It was also a milestone in
Houston’s career, as it sold enough units to be certified platinum , her first single to
achieve this. It was also number one on the Adult Contemporary chart for three weeks, and
reached number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks . It became Houston’s first
number-one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.

“I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)” was ranked fourth on The Billboard Hot 100
Year End Charts (1987), and remained in The Billboard Hot 100 for nineteen weeks.

It was Houston’s fourth number-one single on The Billboard Hot 100, her third on The
Billboard Hot 100 Airplay, fourth on The Billboard Hot 100 Single Sales, her fourth on The
Billboard Adult Contemporary, and her fifth overall Billboard Top Ten hit.

Internationally, Houston made the song a global smash, as it became her biggest hit at that
point. It reached number one in over a dozen other countries, including the United Kingdom ,
West Germany , Australia , and Switzerland , propelling the parent album Whitney to number one
in all of those countries as well. At 4.2 million sold globally, it is Houston’s second
best-selling single after “ I Will Always Love You “.

The video for “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” (directed by Brian Grant ) is one of
Houston’s best recognized music videos. In the intro of this video, Houston just finishes a
performance onstage. She walks backstage, and the scene is intercut with more vivid,
colorful images of her. The song then explodes into its beginning, with myriad locations and
various outfits by Houston, as dancers trying to impress her as she dances around, just having
a good time. The music video was in heavy rotation on music channels MTV , VH1 , and BET during the
song’s run.

The remixes were in charge of Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero , who also worked on remixes
for big names like Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Aretha Franklin, and George Michael.

“My First Night Without You” was the second single from the “A Night To Remember”
album. It reached a disappointing 62 on the US Billboart Hot 100 the week of August 26, 1989.

The song is about coming home for the first time without a partner being there after a break up.
It was written by Lauper, Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg . The latter two also wrote “ True
Colors ” and “ I Drove All Night “.

The track was produced by Lauper and Lennie Petze . It was remixed for the single by Steve
Thompson and Michael Barbiero , who also worked on remixes for big names like Madonna, Whitney
Houston, Aretha Franklin, and George Michael.

The remix has an overall more pop feel to it as well as greater ambience, compared to the album
version. As usually found on radio remixes in those days, many synth sounds were brought
upfront and given wider channel separation. The structure of the remix is the same as that of
its album counterpart, the original length preserved. (there probably was no need to make it
shorter, the album version clocked in at barely 3 minutes, short enough for radio)

This Sounds Familiar!

The intro of the song recalls Ben E. King’s 1961 hit “Stand By Me”. ( click here to listen)

The “Thunderpuss GHV2 Megamix” was released in November 2001 to promote the “GHV2″
compilation.

The songs featured were: “ Don’t Tell Me “, “ Erotica “, “ Secret “, “ Frozen
“, “ What It Feels Like For A Girl “, “ Take a Bow “, “ Deeper and Deeper “, “ Music
” and “ Ray of Light ” (in that order). Other remixes were produced by Johnny Rocks & Mac
Quayle and Tracy Young.

The remix went to #5 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2001 and charted under the
title “Madonna Megamix”. The original Thunderpuss version has some spoken words at the
beginning of “Deeper and Deeper”: this was a recorded message used on the early Internet
to promote the album Bedtime Stories .

Label:

Maverick/Warner Bros.

Catalog number:

PRO-CD-10078

Track listing and Details:

1. Edit (4:14) this was probably the version that got the most airplay

2. Edit (3:30) a shorter version of the lead track, it reduces the running time of each segued
song, and omits the recorded message

3. Original Version (4:50)

    I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Big music fan and serious record collector. This
    passion started thanks to radio in the mid 80's. It became a big hobby in 1997, and I still
    enjoy it very much.
