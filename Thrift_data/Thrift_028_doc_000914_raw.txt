May 25: The Yorkshire Moors, Day 1

Posted by Steve Swartz on June 13, 2010



Our Bed and Breakfast is almost directly across the street from Fountains Abbey , one of the
largest and best-preserved Cistercian Houses in England. The Cistercians started as a
reform movement in opposition to the wealthy, secular lifestyle of the mower powerful abbots
in medieval times. Fountains was founded by monks who were grumpy with the excessive
consumption of the abbots of St Maryâ€™s in York, whose ruins we saw yesterday. We walked
around Fountains this morning in a steady misty drizzle, which really set a mood. A
significant part of the original structure is still here, so that itâ€™s quite easy to
get a feel for where the church used to be and cast the mind both to the simple beauty that was once
here and the financial and religious upheavals that caused Henry VIII to have the place
destroyed. The picture to the left looks from â€œbehindâ€� the church towards the
entrance to the nave and one of the towers in the short arms of the old cathedral; the picture to
the right shows the interior of one of the buildings. Weâ€™re planning on visiting
several of these places in the coming days. I wonder if thatâ€™s such a good idea, as they
tend to put me into a pensive mood.

From Fountains Abbey, we drove south to Harewood House on the northern outskirts of Leeds.
Harewood was built in the late 1700s by a fellow named Edwin Lascelles whose family made its
fortune from selling slaves and lending money to Caribbean plantation owners. Itâ€™s a
relatively late Robert Adam house filled with Chippendale furniture and interesting art,
particularly fine and simple and coherent. Itâ€™s been open to the public since the late
1800s, so theyâ€™ve got this touristy thing down â€“ in addition to the very good
fish and chips on offer in the parking lot, theyâ€™ve also induced a colony of Humboldt
penguins to move into the grounds (attracted by the fish and chips? hard to sayâ€Š). I
might have missed them earlier, as there are a lot more birds in England than in the US, but so far
as I can remember these are the first penguins weâ€™ve seen on the trip. I hadnâ€™t
realized they lived this far north.

From Harewood we traveled west on a pilgrimage to Haworth to see the parsonage where the
BrontÃ« sisters lived when they wrote their novels. The building is brick and blockish, two
stories tall and five across. Itâ€™s directly across the over-crowded graveyard from
the church where the BrontÃ«sâ€™ father worked during their lives (the two pictures
were taken from the same spot, pointing first towards and then away from the house). The area is
rather dreary. The moors are expansive, treeless, dry, leached of color and life. The town is
cramped and twisty. Itâ€™s not a healthy-seeming area, especially when you realize
that the drinking water comes from wells fed by rainwater percolating through the graveyard
out back. Seeing it all puts the bleak atmospheres of the BrontÃ«sâ€™ writing into an
interesting context. The house itself is small (8 or 10 smallish rooms? something like that),
especially when you think that Anne, Charlotte, and Emily lived there with their father and a
servant or two. I mean I know they were tiny folks, but still, it was something to see the family
room and learn that the three of them wrote their great novels at the table in front of the fire,
all at once, pacing around and talking through one anotherâ€™s literary problems. The
house is very well appointed, much nicer than other literary houses Iâ€™ve seen in
England. Well worth a visit for BrontÃ« fans.

Bolton Abbey is another ruin, located just a few miles north of Haworth in the moors. If you are a
fan of The Cure , you might have seen Bolton Abbey on the cover of their album Faith . For the rest
of you, picture a beautiful ruin in the middle of a sheep pasture alongside a picturesque
little river, and youâ€™ll have it as close as needs be. This abbey is slightly more
ramshackle than Fountains, but on the other hand the nave of the old cathedral is still an
active church. That plus the sheep poop and the laundry hanging from the ruins gives a far
different feel to this place than the other. Or maaaaybe itâ€™s just the end of the day? I
donâ€™t know.

May 24: York

Posted by Steve Swartz on June 13, 2010



Well-rested and clean-clothed, we woke up at Mallardâ€™s Grange to the sound of
birdsong and lovesick bulls. Breakfast at Mallardâ€™s is the most varied of all the
places weâ€™ve stayed. Our hosts offer the standard English breakfast, as well as
omelets and a variety of Yorkshire breakfasts (kedgeree, kippers, and other smoked fishes).
Yummy! Itâ€™s also the largest place weâ€™ve stayed at â€“ there are two
other couples here with us, and apparently thereâ€™s a four room thatâ€™s
currently unfilled. The conversation was as good as the food. So we were well satisfied when we
set out on the short drive down to York.

York was founded by the Romans in 71AD. It became the capital of the northern Roman providence
on the island, Britannia Inferior , when the Roman emperor Severus divided Britain in two so as
to minimize the power of any one of the regional lords. Under the Angles after 415, the city was
called Eoforwic and was the capital of Northumbria. Under the Vikings after 866, the city was
called Jorvik and was part of the kingdom of Jorvik (northern England). Under the Normans (who
conquered Jorvik along with the rest of England after 1066), the name â€œJorvikâ€�
gradually evolved to â€œYorkâ€�. The city grew as both an economic and an
ecclesiastical center of power, and stayed so throughout much of the rest of its history.

York is a walled city . More of its walls survive than any other city in England. The only other
city Iâ€™ve been to with such extensive walls is Quebec City in Canada. It retains
extensive evidence of its earlier history. A big part of our day was spent wandering up and
around through the streets, window-shopping, popping into old buildings, and just
generally taking in the sites. Here are pictures of the Roman Walls, the ruined St
Maryâ€™s Abbey that used to house the worldly monks from whom Robin Hood stole, and one of
the crooked shopping streets in the town center.

York Minster dominates ones experience of the city. Along with the cathedral in Cologne , it is
one of the largest gothic cathedrals in Europe. Itâ€™s called a
â€œminsterâ€� rather than a â€œcathedralâ€� because it dates back to
Anglo-Saxon times; in fact, it and Canterbury are the two centers of the Anglican Church in
England. Historically, the minster is interesting both because it was originally the site of
a Roman military building, and because itâ€™s been the city of a Christian church since
the 300s. The building came very close to collapsing in the late 1960s â€“ the
reconstruction of the foundation opened up the area underneath the church, where you can see
the Roman and Anglo-Saxon structures on top of which the current Minster was biult. The
stained glass here is truly remarkable â€“ the Rose Window is outstanding, and the Great
East Window is the largest medieval window in Europe (when itâ€™s in the building
â€“ itâ€™s currently been removed for renovation, and covered with a giant copy of
the window printed on an HP printer. The interior of the building, designed at different
times, is a lesson in the various periods of gothic church architecture in England. This is one
of the prettiest buildings in England, we were lucky to get to see it.

In addition to the walking about and touring the Minster, we also toured the
Treasurerâ€™s House (the first house to be given to the National Trust, a stunt as much as
a historic house, the home to a remarkable collection of ghosts) and Fairfax House (a
much-more-authentic home which is reported to be the most exquisite Georgian Townhouse left
in England). I particularly enjoyed Fairfax House â€“ itâ€™s fun to see the
architectural and design styles weâ€™ve been touring in the Great Houses at these more
livable scales. Our friend Lilian came up from Sheffield to have dinner with us. Lilian is a
famous internet law expert who lives on internet time. It turns out to be a challenge to sync up
when one person is planning within a six-hour window and the other is cell-phone- and
internet- free; but things worked out and it was good to see her.Â  Leave a comment Posted in

May 23: A Real Travel & Rest Day

Posted by Steve Swartz on June 7, 2010



Today was another travel day for us: we left the beautiful birdsong of Oxhill and the
comfortable surroundings of Oxbourgh House and headed north towards Yorkshire and Ripon.
Our route was â€œsimpleâ€�: A422 to B4455 to A423 to A45 to M69 to M1 to M18 to A1(M) to
A6055 to A168 to B6265. All that took us a bit less than three hours. We had a practical sort of
lounging-around afternoon once we got to Ripon â€“ we did laundry in a local Laundromat,
we bought lunch at Sainsburyâ€™s and ate it in a small park, and we wondered through the
Ripon Cathedral . Our bed and breakfast, Mallards Grange , is just a few miles west of Ripon
â€“ itâ€™s a farmhouse, more than 400 years old, owned by a family that farms 500
acres and then has a few guests in on the side. Relative to the roads, Mallards is nearly at the
end of the world â€“ everything to the west of it, including the pub where we had dinner, is
in little towns connected by narrow paved paths that might cause problems for two bicyclists
if they had to pass in opposite directions. Our familiarity with these roads, due both the
necessity and the perversity of John Cleese our navigator, is such that we still notice the
particularly tricksy ones, but they no longer fill us with fear or loathing.

May 22: French Style

Posted by Steve Swartz on June 7, 2010



Our very good friends Jack and Liz came up from London and joined us this weekend. They actually
came up the evening of the 21st â€“ we met at The Peacock , our local pub, and had a meal which
was exemplary in all ways (community, service, food) except for Lizâ€™s sea bass, which
was kind of dry and unflavorful. The rest of us enjoyed our better luck, and prepared ourselves
for the morrow. Our huge wagon was only useful to us this one day â€“ abstracting from the
passengerâ€™s judgment of my driving, Jack and Liz were as comfortable in our back seat
as we were in the front. So it goes.

On Saturday, our first stop is Blenheim Palace . It has two interesting qualities: it is one of
the first places weâ€™ve seen that was decorated in a â€œFrenchâ€� style, and
itâ€™s the home of Winston Churchillâ€™s noble family. If you will allow me to
generalize (and of course you have no choice!), "Frenchâ€� style seems to involve more
white on the verticals, and more ornamentation (usually gilded) along the horizontals. So
for instance if you walk into a â€œFrenchâ€� room, the walls are white or pale or
â€œflatâ€�, the woodwork and frames and boundaries between wall and ceiling are
incredibly ornate and shiny and ornate, and the ornamentation in wall and ceiling is usually a
painting that is kind of equaled (or even sometimes dwarfed) by the gilded frame and woodwork.
To me, the most interesting thing here was the history. John Churchill (the first Duke of
Marborough ) was given this incredible palace because of his remarkable military victories
in the early 1700s. He put a lot of money into tapestries and other artworks that commemorated
him (woo-hoo!). Today, we got to tour the old rooms with his trophies, and also the rooms
dedicated to Winston Churchill (a cousin once removed from the inheritance of this place).
Who knew that Sir Winston was that good of a painter? or that shy of a lover?

From Blenheim we drove on to Whaddeson Manor . Built in 1875, it is the newest house
weâ€™ve seen on the trip. It has the same â€œFrenchâ€� style going on (the
furniture white-skinny-legged and gold-ornamented with rich pillows, the rooms similar).
In addition to the architectural interest, itâ€™s also curious to consider the
Rothschilds (the late-rich family who built this) and their history, which is made very clear
at the house. This is a family who made all their money in times we kind of remember, making loans
and investing in businesses. The English Rothschilds were a relatively late but competent
branch of the family. The house they left us to see is mostly interesting on account of its
collections: the rings, the snuff-boxes, the china, the stamps, the little bits the family
collected which are remarkable now.

We pushed our luck by taking Jack and Liz to a third place, the Stowe Landscape Gardens . This is
one of the most curious gardens in England, an extreme â€œ landscape garden â€�
where all natural things are destroyed, dozens of curious follies are created, and one walks
in a construction trying to be natural. We spent an hour here, puzzling the maps, identified
the silliness, and relaxing.

On to the evening, where we went to The Bell , the pub next to Jack and Lizâ€™s B&B. We all
agreed that it was inferior in all ways to The Peacock, which left Allison and I feeling a bit
smug about our local, hahaha.Â  But we enjoyed the meal, eh? Leave a comment Posted in Travel



May 21: North towards Leeds

Posted by Steve Swartz on June 6, 2010



Today we drove off towards Leeds and The North of England to see two fine old houses. Our first
stop was Hardwick Hall , one of the most astonishing Elizabethan-era houses weâ€™ve
seen. Itâ€™s in the renaissance style, one of the first styles adopted by the English
after they were able to build homes that didnâ€™t have to be fortified. The house was
built by Elizabeth (â€œBessâ€�), Countess of Shrewsbury , who was the ancestress
of the Dukes of Devonshire. Elizabeth is one of the most remarkable women weâ€™ve
encountered in the stories of these houses. She was born into a modest country-aristocrat
sort of situation; through a series of adept marriages she became one of the wealthiest and
most powerful people in Elizabethan England. She stands at the head of two lines of modern
Dukes, and is an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth II. At one point, she owned the vast majority of the
useful land in two counties in north-central England.

There are actually two houses at Hardwick: Bess renovated one, and then abandoned it to a ruin
so it would provide a nice view from the windows of her second house. Then she cleaned up a third
house, Chatsworth House , which became the regular home of her family through the years. That
meant that Hardwick House was left largely unmodified, which is one of the reasons it retains
so much 1500s detail, all high ceilings and ornate paneling and world-class tapestries over
the paneling and interesting paintings over the tapestries. Unlike many of the other houses
weâ€™ve seen, the state rooms were actually up on the top floor â€“ a
guestâ€™s path into the house started at the bottom and wound its way up through
remarkable staircases to the huge elegant great hall on the top floor (this one is the largest
by volume in England). In addition to the fabulous old and largely unmodified decorations,
Bess was also fascinated by tapestries and needlework, so, the house contains one of the most
important collections of cloth with stitches in it in the country. Bess and her fourth husband
were responsible for detaining Mary Queen of Scots for many years. Bess and Mary worked
together on several tapestries, some of which are on display. The combination of historical
interest, quality of presentation, and sheer wonderfulness of the houses makes this visit
really excellent.

From Hardwick, we drove a little farther north to Nostell Priory . You enter the house through a
low-ceilinged, stone-finished room on the ground floor that was once the Great Hall but now
seems more a kind of glorified basement. It turns out that the roomâ€™s ceiling was
lowered significantly when the Robert Adam redecoration was started on the first floor. That
redecoration went horribly awry when the guy who had commissioned it had a horse accident on
the highway to London and died of his injuries. Some of the volunteers told us heâ€™d been
on a tea smuggling trip, others denied it emphatically. It turns out that tea was taxed so
heavily and came so expensive that people would use it and resell it down the social ladder,
noble-person to trusted servants to peasants. His sad wife, a rich Swiss woman heâ€™d
met on his Grand Tour who barely spoke English, halted the redecoration and spent the rest of
her life in seclusion in the house. We didnâ€™t run into her ghost, thank goodness (many
folks do). The highlights here are, again, the Adam rooms. These are more rich in patterning
than some of Adamâ€™s earlier work, but still in a low-contrast mode that works as a
single color if you squint. The Chippendale furniture, the Italian-style wall paintings,
and the libraries were also pretty fabulous. There was a particularly beautiful old â€œ
longcase clock â€� in one of the rooms (I think weâ€™d call them grandfather clocks
these days, but I may be mistaken) And there was a remarkable dollâ€™s house decorated in
much the same style as the house.

May 20: Oxford

Posted by Steve Swartz on May 27, 2010



Oxford is about forty-five minutes drive south of where weâ€™re staying, so,
itâ€™s an obvious destination. Itâ€™s the home of Oxford University , which is the
oldest university in England (and the best, according to its graduates). Itâ€™s also a
beautiful town of 150,000 inhabitants with buildings in every architectural style that has
been popular in England for the last 1000 years, all working together in harmony on account of a
consistency of color. It would be a nightmare to drive around downtown, but they have a great
park-and-ride system, so we were in a large car-park on the outskirts of town and then into the
city before you could say bobâ€™s your uncle.



Image:
http://steveswblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/p10102485b45d.jpg?w=594&h=215

Oxford University is made up of a couple dozen colleges which are scattered around town.
Iâ€™m not sure I have this right, but I believe that students apply to and become members
of individual colleges. Faculty are associated with individual colleges, but also with
departments that have buildings separate from the individual colleges. A student has a tutor
associated with their college that manages their education, and core courses are taught in
the colleges. Once a student decides to specialize, they go to the building of the departments
to see lectures in the areas of their specialty. Itâ€™s an interesting system; it seems
to me that it would encourage a student to be more responsible for their own education, and open
up more opportunities for the kind of specific education a specific person might want.

Anyway, when we got to town we spent our morning in the Ashmolean Museum , which turned out to be
one of the best museums Allison and I have ever visited. Itâ€™s not huge like museums in
the European capitals or the big US cities, but its collection is quite extensive, and each
piece is of remarkable quality. Many of the houses weâ€™ve visited might could have
deserved a longer visit, but the Ashmolean was the first place we stopped where I would really
have liked to have been able to stay the whole day.

But there is a lot to do in Oxford. Thereâ€™s the Oxford University Museum which contains
the universityâ€™s natural history artifacts (dinosaurs, rocks, bugs, dodos), and
the Pitt Rivers Museum which contains the universityâ€™s archaeological and
anthropological artifacts (shrunken heads, native clothes, ancient drug paraphernalia).
Both of these (especially the Pitt Rivers) are a window back to the way museums were set up in
Victorian times â€“ a whole bunch of things in cabinets, with simple labels, and enough
information to make a person wonder. Thereâ€™s the Bodleian Library , which may be great
for researchers, but sucks as a tourist destination since theyâ€™ll show you the
buildings but not any of the book treasures they have. Thereâ€™s the Bate Collection of
Musical Instruments , a collection of old instruments of all sorts, fascinating as you look at
the evolution of instruments and the various alternative ways people tried to solve their
problems over the years. And of course just wondering around and looking at the various
colleges is quite wonderful, though several colleges charge entrance fees just to look at the
outside of their buildings, which crimps the style of the wonderer. Iâ€™m sure there are
other collections that other tastes might have found in the city â€“ itâ€™s a
fascinating place to explore.

May 19: The Cotswolds

Posted by Steve Swartz on May 26, 2010



The Cotswolds are what you might call a â€œhill rangeâ€� running about a hundred
miles through the lower center of England. Theyâ€™re beautiful, both because of the
naturally rolling topography, and because of the yellow stone buildings that characterize
the area. Our plan today is to drive along the spine of the hill range from north-east to
south-west, stopping at gardens and old houses to see what we can see. The majority of the day
will be spent on â€œBâ€� roads, which would have been a worry a few weeks ago, but no
more: it shows you can get used to anything, even wacky roads, if you live with it long enough.

Our first stop was at Hidecote Manor Garden . An American woman named Gertrude Winthrop bought
this property in the early 1900s. Her son, Laurence Johnston, planted the gardens.
Itâ€™s centered in the part of England that spawned the Arts and Crafts Movement, a
movement which resulted in â€œ Craftsman â€� houses and furniture in the United
States. Despite what you might be thinking, it has nothing to do with Craftsman power tools .
The garden is broken up into a couple of dozen individual areas or â€œroomsâ€�,
separated by hedges of one sort or another, each with its own theme or look. Some of the themes
have to do with the shape of the room, some with the sort of plants being grown, and some with
water features or sculptures. The garden is between seasons, the spring flowers towards
their ends and the summer flowers not here yet, but itâ€™s still a beautiful place to walk
around, and the whole idea of rooms in gardens is very interesting.

South from Hidecote, we stopped for a while in the town of Chipping Camden . It seems to be the
most touristically active town in the region: once a center of the wool trade, itâ€™s now
filled with shops and restaurants and hotels, and even in the â€œoff seasonâ€�
there seems to be a lot going on. Besides just walking down the streets and soaking up the
atmosophere, my favorite part of the visit was walking into the parish church and seeing
Sophia Lisovskaya practicing for her classical recital later in the day. Too bad we had places
to go and things to see!

Onwards to Sudeley Castle ! Sudeley Castle is nearly 1000 years old, and it has had quite a
history. It was owned by a Whoâ€™s Who of middle-period English historical figures:
Edward IV, Richard III, Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Thomas Seymour, and William Parr (to
name a few). Queen Elizabeth I apparently didnâ€™t like the fellow who owned the place
when she was running things: she nearly bankrupted him with three visits in which he had to pay
for her and her retinue of hundreds for weeks at a time. Today itâ€™s a picturesque place.
Part of it is left as a ruin in the midst of formal gardens, which is kind of nice. The rest of it is a
very elegant castle, renovated by local merchants in the 1800s, and owned today by Lady
Ashcombe and her two children. As nice as it looked outside, it was almost surely the worst tour
experience of our trip. It appears that you can see part of the castle and the grounds for an
initial entry fee, but what you get to see is just some exhibitions in an out-building of the
castle. The tour itself does not visit the more interesting rooms in the castle, and
itâ€™s run by a fellow who was more inclined to tell dumb jokes than give us information
about the house. Toss in the art placed around the property by one of the younger owners, and the
castle was almost a parody of â€œbad tour experienceâ€�. So it goes.

Late in the day, we decided to pop on over to Gloucester and see the cathedral . We were lucky
enough to catch the Evensong service again, the choir was quite good, and the cathedral is
beautiful. Edward II is buried here. He was an unpopular king for a variety of reasons: he was an
incompetent administrator, a terrible military leader, and it seems quite possible that he
was homosexual, which wasnâ€™t done 700 years before Stonewall .
