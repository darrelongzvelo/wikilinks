History of Neuropathology and Microscopy

Antonj Van Leeuwenhoek 1667: He described the vascular supply of the cortical of the cerebral
convolutions, the structure of the lens of the eye, discovered the rods of the retina, the
connective tissue fibers and epithelium of the cornea and the striated appearance of
muscles. He also noticed that the nervous tissue consisted of diverse, very small threads or
vessels lying by one another. In the cut ends of nerves he saw minute tubules, presumably
myelin sheaths.



Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694): Malpighi used the microscope for studies on skin , kidney ,
and for the first interspecies comparison of the liver . He greatly extended the science of
embryology . The use of microscopes enabled him to describe the development of the chick in its
egg , and discovered that insects (particularly, the silk worm ) do not use lungs to breathe,
but small holes in their skin called tracheae . Later he falsely concluded that plants had
similar tubules. However, he observed that when a ringlike portion of bark was removed on a
trunk a swelling of the tissues would occur above the ring. He correctly interpreted this as
growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being blocked above the ring. He was
the first to see capillaries and discovered the link between arteries and veins that had
eluded William Harvey .

Malpighi is regarded as the founder of microscopic anatomy and the first histologist . Many
microscopic anatomical structures are named after him, including a skin layer ( Malpighi
layer ) and two different Malpighian corpuscles in the kidneys and the spleen , as well as the
Malpighian tubules in the excretory system of insects.

He also studied chick embryo development with detailed drawings and discovered taste buds of
human tongue. Some of his studies he made by vivisection . He also studied the anatomy of a brain
and concluded that this organ is a gland . In terms of modern endocrinology this deduction is
correct because neurotransmitter substances represent paracrine hormones, and the
hypothalamus of the brain has long been recognized for its hormone-secreting capacity. He
was also among the first to study human fingerprints .

His treatise 'De polypo cordis' (1666) was important towards understanding how blood clots
and its composition. He may have been the first person to see red blood cells under a
microscope. He described how the form of a blood clot differed in the right vs. the left sides of
the heart.

In addition to his anatomical studies, he was one of the rare contemporary scholars who
studied plants ; he published his findings in a book Anatomia Plantarum in 1671. It was the most
exhaustive study of botany at the time. The Royal Society published it the next year. The great
Swedish botanist Linnaeus named the genus Malpighia in honor of Malpighi's work on plants;
Malpighia is the type genus for the Malpighiaceae , a family of tropical and subtropical
flowering plants.

After the dissection of a black male, Malpighi made some ground-breaking headway into the
discovery of the origin of black skin. Malpighi found that the black pigment was caused by a
layer of mucus just beneath the skin.





Frederik Ruysch ( March 28 , 1638 — February 22 , 1731 ): Ruysch researched many areas of human
anatomy , and physiology, using spirits to preserve organs, and assembled one of Europe's
most famous anatomical collections. His chief skill was the preparation and preservation of
specimens in a secret liquor balsamicum and is believed to be one of the first to use arterial
embalming to this effect. In 1697 Peter the Great and Nicolaes Witsen visited Ruysch who had
all the specimens exposed in five rooms, on two days during the week open for the public.



Samuel Thomas von Soemmering (1755-1830): SÃ¶mmerring discovered the macula in the
retina of the human eye . His investigations on the brain and the nervous system , on the sensory
organs , on the embryo and its malformations, on the structure of the lungs , made him one of the
most important German anatomists. When SÃ¶mmerring was 23 years old he described the
organization of the cranial nerves as part of this doctoral work: its study is valid until
today. He published many writings in the fields of medicine, anatomy and neuroanatomy ,
anthropology, paleontology, astronomy and philosophy. Among other things he wrote about
fossil crocodiles and Archaeopteryx . He was also the first to accurately draw a
representation of the female skeleton structure.

Francesco Gennari (1750-1797): Described the white stria between the 3rd and the 4rth layer
of the visual cortex, which renamed as line of Gennari by Obersteiner at 1888.



FÃ©lix Vicq d'Azyr (23 April 1746 - 20 June 1794): As an anatomist he was one of the first to use
coronal sections of the brain and to use alcohol to aid dissection . He described the locus
coeruleus , the locus niger in the brain , in 1786, and the band of Vicq d'Azyr , a fiber system
between the external granular layer and the external pyramidal layer of the cerebral cortex ,
as well as the mamillo-thalamic tract , which bears his name. His systematic studies of the
cerebral convolutions became a classic and Vicq d'Azyr was one of the first neuroanatomists
to name the gyri. He studied the deep gray nuclei of the cerebrum and the basal ganglia . He
participated in the Second Encyclopedia.



Della Torre1776: in his microscopical observations describes globuli in the brain; He says
that he saws them floating in a pellucid viscous fluid.



Prochaska (1779) wrote: 'For when a small piece of the substance of either the cortical or the
medullary part of the cerebrum or cerebellum is placed on a very thin glass and flattened out,
so that it becomes conveniently transparent, then,

with the help of a selected optical lens, it is revealed to be as it were a thick paste consisting
of innumerable globules, in which no movement or swimming can be observed.' Prochaska tried
by dilution and prolonged maceration to separate the globules completely from one another,
but without success; and he concluded that they must be held together by a very subtle and very
transparent connective tissue ('tela cellulari'). He describes the shape of the globules as
'not exactly spherical but irregularly rotund'. Reference has been made by a number of
historians to Prochaska's work. Prochaska describes carefully the various appearances
obtained as he focused his lens on the globules.



Fontana (1781): also describes 'petits corpuscules ronds' in both the cortical and
medullary parts of the brain. He differed from Prochaska, however, in his account of the
structure of nerves: here he found 'cylindres tortueux primitives', which he considered to
be of an elementary nature ('des principes simples primitifs, non composes d'autres
moindres'). He regarded such primitive cylinders as being the basis also of tendons and
muscles. He describes globules in the 'gluten' of the skin of eels. He also found globules in
the retina of the eye. Fontana repeatedly uses the phrase 'tissu cellulaire' to mean areolar
connective tissue.



Johann Christian Reil (20 February, 1759 - 22 November, 1813): Medical conditions and
anatomical features named after him include Reil's finger , Beau-Reil cross furrows on the
fingernails and the Islands of Reil in the cerebral cortex . In 1809, he was the first to
describe the white fibre tract now called the arcuate fasciculus . In 1795 Reil established
the very first journal of psychology in German, the Archiv fÃŒr die Physiologie. In 1810 he
became one of the first university teachers of psychiatry when appointed professor in Berlin
.



Rolando enrolled at the Faculty of Medicine in his native city. Here he showed particular
interest in the anatomy courses of Giovanni Francesco Cigna (1734-1790), who considered
Rolando his most promising pupil. However, he also devoted time to studies in comparative
anatomy and zoology. He obtained his doctorate in 1793 with a thesis on an anatomical and
physiological study of the lungs in various classes of animals. Rolando (1773-1831):
Rolando’s most important studies were devoted to the anatomical, physiological, and
embryological examination of the brain. In particular, he examined the gray matter, which he
considered to be different from that of the striate bodies. He also discovered the cerebral
branches and fibrous processes, which he studied by means of serial sections. Contradicting
existing opinion, Rolando asserted that in the first stages of development of the central
nervous system of the embryo two vesicles appear, representing the medulla oblongata, from
which the cerebral hemispheres are then developed; to the latter he attributed the
intellectual faculties.Experimental research on the cerebellum led him to consider,
before Marie Jean Pierre Flourens (1794-1867) – with whom he had an argument on the priority
of the discovery – that this organ governs muscular movements. Rolando had observed that in
animals in which lesions of this organ are induced; such movements progressively decrease
until they disappear entirely, parallel with the extent and seriousness of the damage.
Flourens then correctly restricted the functions of the cerebellum to the coordination of
movement, but he refused to acknowledge that Rolando had preceded him along this course.
Rolando conducted experiments in 1809 involving the removal of the cerebral hemisphere and
cerebellum from animals. He also used electric current to stimulate the cortex. Based on his
observations, he correctly concluded that the cerebrum controlled voluntary body
functions and the cerebellum controlled involuntary functions.





Sir Charles Bell (Born November 1774, in Doun in Monteath, Edinburgh - Died April 28 , 1842 , in
North Hallow, Worcestershire ): He first published detailed studies of the nervous system
and brain in 1811, in his book An Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain. He described his experiments
with animals and how he was the first to distinguish between sensory and motor nerves . This
book is considered by many the founding stone of clinical neurology .

He was one of the first physicians to combine the scientific study of neuroanatomy with
clinical practice. He described in 1821 the trajectory of the facial nerve and a disease which
led to the unilateral palsy (paralysis) of facial muscles, in one of the classics of
neurology, a paper to the Royal Society entitled On the Nerves: Giving an Account of some
Experiments on Their Structure an Functions, Which Lead to a New Arrangement of the System. He
wrote also the first treatise on notions of anatomy and physiology of facial expression for
painters and illustrators, titled Essays on the Anatomy of Expression in Painting (1806).

Franz Joseph Gall ( 9 March 1758 - 22 August 1828 ): Around 1800, he developed " cranioscopy ", a
method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the
basis of the external shape of the skull. Cranioscopy («cranium»: skull, «scopos»:
vision) was later renamed to phrenology («phrenos»: mind, «logos»). Gall is recognized
as the first to identify the grey matter of the brain with active tissue – neurons - and the
white matter with conducting tissue - ganglia.

Johann Caspar Spurzheim (1776-1832): On March 14, 1808, Spurzheim and Gall presented their
jointly authored work Recherches sur le systÃšme nerveux . . . to the Institut de France.
This was published in Paris the following year. They subsequently began working on the
publication of the major work Anatomie et physiologie du systÃšme nerveux en
gÃ©nÃ©ral . . . Publication of this four-volume work began in 1810, but in 1813, Gall and
Spurzheim ended their collaboration after the first 146 pages of volume 2. The remainder was
written by Gall alone. It was not until this year that Spurzheim was formally awarded his
medical degree.



Jules Gabriel Francais Baillarger (1809-1890): In 1843, with FranÃ§ois Achille Longet
(1811-1871), Laurent Alexis Philibert Cerise (1807-1869), and Jacques-Joseph Moreau
(1804-1884) he founded the journal Annales mÃ©dico-psychologiques du systÃšme
nerveux, in which he published many of his papers. This is still published and is therefore the
oldest journal of psychiatry in the world. Later he was the moving spirit in establishing the
SociÃ©tÃ© mÃ©dico-psychologique and the Association mutuelle des mÃ©decins
aliÃ©nistes. At the age of thirty, while still engaged in clinicopathologic
correlations, Baillarger presented in 1840 a paper before the AcadÃ©mie royale de
mÃ©decine on the structure of the grey matter of the cortex. Baillarger, made his advances
by cutting thin slices of fresh cortex, placing them between two pieces of glass, and
observing them with the aid of a light held behind them. By this means he divided the cortex into
six layers of alternate white and grey laminae. He was able to determine that the white lines
seen by Francisco Gennari in the occipital area could be traced in all parts of the cortex,
although they were far less conspicuous anteriorly than posteriorly. This continuation of
Gennari' s line has therefore come to be known as the "external line or white stripe of
Baillarger". Baillarger's stripes attracted much attention and as late as 1907, Elliot
Smith – who at that time was in Cairo – examined freshly cut slices of brain with a hand lens,
and taking the stripes as landmarks, was able to distinguish some forty sharply delimited
cortical areas. In addition to being the first to demonstrate that the cortex is made up of
layers – "resembling a grey ribbon with three white bands in it" – Baillarger was also the
first to show that fibres connected the cortex with the internal white matter. "At the summit
of the convolutions," he wrote, "the white matter is entirely united to the grey matter by many
fibres. A simple juxtaposition of these two components is thus inadmissible." He also
demonstrated that the surface of the human brain in comparison to its own volume is less than
that in smaller animals, and that as a compensatory measure larger brains undergo greater
fissuration than smaller ones – in short that the difference in external form of
lissencephalic and gyrencephalic brains is explicable on the basis of the geometric law of
volumes, that the volumes increases as the cube of the diameter while the surface increases at
the square.



Remak (1844): Robert Remak is remembered for discovering and naming - in 1842 - the three germ
layers of the early embryo: the ectoderm, the mesoderm and the endoderm. He discovered the
nonmedullated nerve fibres in 1838, and in 1844 the nerve cells of the heart, called Remak's
ganglia. He was also the first who recognized the six layers of the human brain cortex.



Benedikt Stilling ( February 11 , 1810 - January 28 , 1879 ): Stilling made important
contributions in the field of neurology , while he performed research involving the
structure of the cerebellum , as well as histological studies of the pons . In 1840 he made first
mention of vasomotor nerves in a treatise titled Physiologisch-pathologische und
medicinisch-praktische Untersuchungen ÃŒber die Spinal-Irritation. Also he is
remembered for introducing a procedure of serial-section portrayal (thin slicing) of
spinal cord specimens for histological study.



Blum (1893): In 1893 Blum introduced the stabilization of the specimens in formaldehyde
solutions.



RenÃ©-Joachim Dutrochet (1824): could only see a "fluide diaphane" within nerve fibers of
the frog, Henri Milne-Edwards (1825) believed those of the rabbit to contain or be composed of
"fibres Ã©lÃ©mentaires", themselves consisting of long chains of diminutive
globules. Rapidly evolving technical skills and quality in optics - particularly the
introduction of achromatic objectives - paved the way for more reliable observations and
further controversy. The longitudinal "cavity" originally described in nerve fibers (van
Leeuwenhoek, 1717) was now found clearly visible as a transparent "primitive band" coursing
throughout the core of certain (myelinated) nerve fibers of vertebrates (Remak, 1838). But
whereas such "cell-cavity" appeared just "to be filled by a firm substance" according to
Theodor Schwann (1839), the corresponding axial region of the wider nerve fibers of some
invertebrates was described by Robert Remak (1843) as containing an uninterrupted bundle of
very delicate filaments or fibrils. Furthermore, when at least some of those nerve fibers
were demonstrated to be tubular processes anastomosed to, and therefore continuous with,
nearby globules or nerve cells, the central fibrillar bundle within a given nerve fiber would
occasionally be seen to reach into the body of an associated cell, and form therein concentric
layers of fibrils around the nucleus (Remak, 1844).



Ehremberg (1833): Described the myelinated an non-myelinated nerve fibers



Theodor Schwann (1810-1882): German physiologist and histologist. He was a student of J. P.
MÃŒller and professor at the universities of Louvain (1838-48) and LiÃšge (from 1848). A
cofounder (with Matthias Schleiden) of the cell theory, Schwann extended the work of
Schleiden and demonstrated that the cell is the basis of animal as well as of plant tissue, and
because he recognized the physiological and the morphological significance of the cell in
advance of other 19th-century biologists he may be called the father of cytology. He
described the nerve sheath known by his name and demonstrated the living nature of yeasts. Of
great influence was his Microscopical Researche in the Structure and Growth of Animals and
Plants (1839, tr. 1847).



Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters (November 15, 1834 – December 5, 1863): Around 1860, Deiters
provided the most comprehensive description of a nerve cell that was known to exist at the
time. He identified the cells' axon , which he called an "axis cylinder", and its dendrites ,
which he referred to as protoplasmic processes. He postulated that dendrites must fuse to
form a continuous network. His name is lent to the nucleus of Deiters, also called the lateral
vestibular nucleus , and Deiters' cell, which is associated with outer hair cells in the
cochlea of the inner ear . Deiters died in 1863 from typhoid fever at the age of 29. After his
death, his work concerning nerve cells of the spinal cord was edited and published by
anatomist Max Schultze (1825-1874).

Camillo Golgi ( July 7 , 1843 – January 21 , 1926 ) was an Italian physician , pathologist ,
scientist , and Nobel laureate. He spent much of his career studying the central nervous
system . Tissue staining techniques in the latter half of the 19th century were inadequate for
studying nervous tissue . While working as chief medical officer in a psychiatric hospital ,
he experimented with metal impregnation of nervous tissue, using mainly silver ( silver
staining ). He discovered a method of staining nervous tissue which would stain a limited
number of cells at random, in their entirety. This enabled him to view the paths of nerve cells
in the brain for the first time. He called his discovery the " black reaction " (in Italian,
reazione nera), which later received his name ( Golgi's method ) or Golgi stain. The black
reaction consisted in fixing silver chromate particles to the neurilemma (the neuron
membrane) by reacting silver nitrate with potassium dichromate . This resulted in a stark
black deposit on the soma as well as on the axon and all dendrites , providing an exceedingly
clear and well contrasted picture of neuron against a yellow background. The ability to
visualize separate neurons led to the eventual acceptance of the neuron doctrine .

In addition to this discovery, Golgi discovered a tendon sensory organ that bears his name (
Golgi receptor ). He studied the life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum and related the timing of
fevers seen in malaria with the life cycle of this organism. Using his staining technique,
Golgi identified the intracellular reticular apparatus in 1898 which bears his name, the
Golgi apparatus . Golgi, together with Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal , received the Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for his studies of the structure of the nervous system.

Karl Friedrich Burdach (1776-1847) He provided in 1822 the name--due the arching shape of its
longest ï¬�bres--now given to the arcuate fasciculus .

Column of Burdach — fasciculus cuneatus; the lateral portion of the dorsal funiculus of the
spinal cord. - The American Illustrated Medical Dictionary (1938)

Among his works are:

Diatetik fÃŒr Gesunde (1805)

EnzyklopÃ€die der Heilwissenschaft (three volumes, 1810-12)

Vom Bau und Leben des Gehirns und RÃŒckenmarks (three volumes, 1819-25)

Die Physiologie als Erfahrungswissenschaft (1826-40)



Rudolph Albert von KÃ¶lliker ( July 6 , 1817 – November 2 , 1905 ): He was among the first to
introduce into this branch of biological inquiry the newer microscopic technique - the
methods of hardening, sectioning and staining . Among his earlier results was the
demonstration in 1847 that smooth or unstriated muscle is made up of distinct units, of
nucleated muscle cells. In this work, he followed in the footsteps of his master Henle. A few
years before this, there was doubt whether arteries had muscle in their walls - in addition, no
solid histological basis as yet existed for those views as to the action of the nervous system
on the circulation , which were soon to be put forward, and which had such a great influence on
the progress of physiology. As early as 1845, while still at Zurich, he supplied the clear
proof that nerve fibers are continuous with nerve cells , and so furnished the absolutely
necessary basis for all sound speculations as to the actions of the central nervous system .

From that time onward he continually laboured at the histology of the nervous system, and more
especially at the difficult problems presented by the intricate patterns in which nerve
fibers and neurons are woven. together in the brain and spinal cord . From his early days a
master of method, he saw at a glance the value of the new Golgi staining method for the
investigation of the central nervous system, and, to the great benefit of science, took up
once more in his old age, with the aid of a new means, the studies for which he had done so much in
his youth. KÃ¶lliker contributed greatly to knowledge of the inner structure of the brain .

Max Johann Sigismund Schultze ( March 25 , 1825 - January 16 , 1874 ): He founded, in 1865, and
edited the important Archiv fÃŒr mikroskopische Anatomie, to which he contributed many
papers, and he advanced the subject generally, by refining on its technical methods. His
works included:

BeitrÃ€ge zur Naturgeschichte der Turbellarien (1851)

Uber den Organismus der Polythalamien (1854)

BeitrÃ€ge zur Kenntnis der Landplanarien (1857)

Zur Kenntnis der elektrischen Organe der Fische (1858)

Ein heizbarer Objecttisch und seine Verwendung bei Untersuchungen des Blutes (1865, in
which the first known description of the platelet )

Zur Anatomie und Physiologie der Retina (1866)

Franz Nissl ( 9 September 1860 – 11 August 1919 ): He is best known for developing a
histological stain which allowed for selective visualization of neuronal cell bodies
throughout the brain, ushering a new era in neurocytology and neuropathology. He also did
important work in psychiatry correlating changes in glial cells, blood vessels, and brain
tissue in general with mental illness. He also worked with Alois Alzheimer . Toward the end of
his life he studied the nature of the connections between the cerebral cortex and the thalamus
. The Nissl method uses basic aniline to stain RNA blue, and is used to highlight important
structural features of neurons. The Nissl substance ( rough endoplasmic reticulum ) appears
dark blue due to the staining of ribosomal RNA, giving the cytoplasm a mottled appearance.
Individual granules of extranuclear RNA are named Nissl granules ( ribosomes ). DNA present
in the nucleus stains a similar color.

Marchi’s and Waller’s contribution was substantial for the evolution of
Neuropathology, while they described staining methods for the study of degenerated
myelinated nerve fibers.

Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal (1 May 1852 – 17 October 1934) was a Spanish histologist ,
physician , pathologist and Nobel laureate . His pioneering investigations of the
microscopic structure of the brain were so original and influential that he is considered by
many to be the greatest neuroscientist of all time. His skills as an artist allowed him to make
hundreds of drawings still used for educational purposes today. RamÃ³n y Cajal's early
work was accomplished at the Universities of Zagarosa and Valencia where he focused on the
pathology of inflammation , the microbiology of cholera , and the structure of epithelial
cells and tissues. It was not until he moved to the University of Barcelona in 1887 that he
learned Golgi's silver nitrate preparation and turned his attention to the central nervous
system. During this period he made extensive studies of neural material covering a large
variety of species and most major regions of the brain.

RamÃ³n y Cajal's made several major contributions to neuroanatomy. He discovered the
axonal growth cone, and provided the best evidence supporting Auguste Forel's theory of
nerve cell contact. He provided detailed descriptions of cell types associated with neural
structures, and produced excellent depictions of structures and their connectivity. He was
an advocate of the existence of spines, although he did not recognize them as the site of
contact from presynaptic cells. He was a proponent of polarization of nerve cell function and
his student Lorente de No would continue this study of input/output systems into cable theory
and some of the earliest circuit analysis of neural structures. RamÃ³n y Cajal was a fierce
defender of the neuron theory .

Ross G. Harisson(1907): In 1907 Dr. Harrison first adopted the hanging drop culture method to
the study of embryonic tissues. His observation that the outgrowth of the nerve from the
parent cell body demonstrated that the outgrowth was a form of protoplasmic movement settled
a long-standing controversy as to the formation and fundamental nature of nerve fibers. An
outgrowth of the tissue-culture technique was the growth of poliomyelitis virus on monkey
kidney cells. Through his successful development of a method of transplanting organs by
removing embryonic cells at early stages of development from their normal positions and
placing them either in another part of the same embryo or even another embryo it became
possible to trace the subsequent development of the particular cells or organ that had been
transplanted.

Dr. Harrison had served for seventeen years as Sterling Professor at Yale. He was born in
Germantown, Philadelphia, a son of Samuel and Katherine Diggs Harrison, on Jan. 13, 1870. He
was graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1889 and
received a Ph.D. there in 1894.

Jean-Martin Charcot (29 November 1825 – 16 August 1893): was a French neurologist and
professor of anatomical pathology . He is known as "the founder of modern neurology" and is
"associated with at least 15 medical eponyms ", including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). His work greatly influenced the
developing fields of neurology and psychology . He was the "foremost neurologist of late
nineteenth-century France" and has been called "the Napoleon of the neuroses .

Charcot's name is associated with many diseases and conditions including:

Charcot's artery ( lenticulostriate artery )

Charcot's joint (diabetic arthropathy )

Charcot's disease ( amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , also known as Lou Gehrig's disease)

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (peroneal muscular atrophy )

Charcot Wilbrand syndrome ( visual agnosia and loss of ability to revisualise images)

Charcot's intermittent hepatic fever (intermittent pain, intermittent fever,
intermittent jaundice, and loss of weight)

Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms (tiny aneurysms of the penetrating branches of middle cerebral
artery in hypertensives)

Charcot's triad

Charcot arthropathy

Charcot-Lyden crystals due to eosinophils white blood cells lysis in cases of allergic
diseases

EdmÃ© FÃ©lix Alfred Vulpian (January 5, 1826 – May 18, 1887): He was the co-discoverer
of Vulpian-Bernard spinal muscular atrophy and the Vulpian-Heidenhain-Sherrington
phenomenon .

Vulpian was born in Paris , France , in 1826. Among other noted discoveries and experiments,
Vulpian discovered adrenaline in the adrenal medulla .

John Cheyne (1777-1836): He studied pathology in Scotland and dissection with Charles Bell
and wrote his first book – Essays of Diseases of Children – in 1801. He wrote one of the
important early monographs on laryngology, Pathology of the Membrane of the Larynx and
Bronchia, in 1809. He first described acute hydrocephalus, in 1808, and in 1809 contributed
on croup.

John Abercrombie ( October 10 , 1780 in Aberdeen – November 14 , 1844 in Edinburgh ): From 1816
he published various papers in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, which formed the
basis of his more extensive works: Pathological and Practical Researches on Diseases of the
Brain and Spinal Cord, regarded as the first textbook in neuropathology , and Researches on
the Diseases of the Intestinal Canal, Liver and other Viscera of the Abdomen, both published
in 1828.

Hooper 1826: He published the first atlas of Neuropathology, based on more than 4000
autopsies which had been held at St Marylebone hospital. He described the acute and chronic
inflammation of the Dura Matter, epidural , subdural , and subarachnoid hematomas , brain
abscesses, brain tumors and cerebral atrophy. He also described the first case of multiple
sclerosis, three years earlier than Gruveilhier.

Jean Cruveilhier (1791 in Limoges , France – 1874 in Sussac ): Cruveilhier was a highly
influential anatomist, and made important contributions in his studies involving the
nervous system . He described the pathology of neuronal lesions observed in what today is
known as multiple sclerosis , publishing his findings and illustrations in 1842. He was also
the first to record the clinical history of a patient who had the disease. However, it wasn't
until 1868 that multiple sclerosis was discovered by neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot to be a
distinct, separate disease. Cruveilhier was a prolific writer, among his works were
Anatomie pathologique du corps humain (1829-1842) and Vie de Dupuytren (Life of Dupuytren,
1840), which was a memorial to his teacher, Guillaume Dupuytren .

His name is associated with "Cruveilhier's sign" (persistent hypertension and occlusion of
the portal vein ) and "Cruveilhier-Baumgarten disease" ( cirrhosis of the liver without
ascites ), which is named along with anatomist Paul Clemens von Baumgarten . Cruveilhier's
name is also associated with several parts of the anatomy, however these terms have largely
been replaced by clinical nomenclature:

Cruveilhier's fossa: scaphoid fossa

Cruveilhier's fascia: superficial fascia of perineum

Cruveilhier's joint: median atlanto-axial joint

Cruveilhier's plexus: posterior cervical plexus



Sir Robert Carswell (1793-1857): Robert Carswell has long been regarded as the most talented
illustrator of pathological conditions to emerge from the early days of taught anatomy in
19th century Britain. His exceptional set of some 1000 watercolours depicting case
histories was produced over a period of time, first in the early 1820s as a student and later as a
physician and professor. Carswell's talent was spotted early, and under the mentorship of
the Edinburgh military surgeon John Thomson he was sent to post-Napoleonic French hospitals
to start building a pictorial teaching library of morbid anatomy cases directly from
dissected bodies.

Richard Bright English physician, born September 28, 1789, Queen's Square, Bristol,
Gloucestershire; died December 16, 1858, London. Guy’s Hospital. He published an
excellent work named ‘’Diseases of the brain and the nervous system’’, in which more
than 200 colorful pictures of neuropathological cases have been included. Among the cases
were gloiomas of the pons, hydrocephalus, intracranial aneurysms.

Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow (13 October 1821 – 5 September 1902): Virchow founded the
medical disciplines of cellular pathology and comparative pathology (comparison of
diseases common to humans and animals ). His very innovative work may be viewed as sitting
between that of Morgagni whose work Virchow studied, and that of Paul Ehrlich , who studied at
the CharitÃ© while Virchow was developing microscopic pathology there. In 1869 he founded
the Society for anthropology, ethnology and prehistory (Gesellschaft fÃŒr
Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte) which was very influential in coordinating
and intensifying German archaeological research. In 1885 he launched a study of craniometry
, which gave surprising results according to contemporary scientific racist theories on the
" Aryan race ", leading him to denounce the " Nordic mysticism" in the 1885 Anthropology
Congress in Karlsruhe . Josef Kollmann , a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same
congress that the people of Europe, be them German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a
"mixture of various races," furthermore declaring that the "results of craniology" led to
"struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race" on
others. In 1892 he was awarded the Copley Medal .

He was a very prolific writer. Some of his works are:

Mittheilungen ÃŒber die in Oberschlesien herrschende Typhus-Epidemie, (1848)

Die Cellularpathologie in ihrer BegrÃŒndung auf physiologische und pathologische
Gewebelehre., (1858), English translation, (1860)

Handbuch der speciellen Pathologie und Therapie, (1854-62)

Vorlesungen ÃŒber Pathologie, (1862-72)

Die krankhaften GeschwÃŒlste, (1863-67)

Gegen den Antisemitismus, (1880)

He also developed a standard method of autopsy procedure, named for him, that is still one of
the two main techniques used today. More than a laboratory physician, Virchow was an
impassioned advocate for social and political reform, stating that physicians should act as
"attorneys for the poor." His views are evident in his "Report on the Typhus Outbreak of Upper
Silesia (1848), "writing that the outbreak could not be solved by treating individual
patients with drugs or with minor changes in food, housing, or clothing laws, but only through
radical action to promote the advancement of an entire population. He is widely regarded as a
pioneer of social medicine . and anthropology."

Virchow's angle, the angle between the nasobasilar line and the nasosubnasal line.

Virchow's cell, a macrophage in Hansen's disease .

Virchow's cell theory, "omnis cellula e cellula" - every living cell comes from another
living cell.

Virchow's concept of pathology, comparison of diseases common to humans and animals.

Virchow's disease, leontiasis ossea , now recognized as a symptom rather an disorder.

Virchow's gland, Virchow's node .

Virchow's Law, during craniosynostosis , skull growth is restricted to a plane
perpendicular to the affected, prematurely fused suture and is enhanced in a plane parallel
to it.

Virchow's triad , factors contributing toward venous thrombus formation.

Aloysius "Alois" Alzheimer, 14 June 1864 - 19 December 1915): a German psychiatrist and
neuropathologist and a colleague of Emil Kraepelin . Alzheimer is credited with identifying
the first published case of "presenile dementia", which Kraepelin would later identify as
Alzheimer's disease . In 1901, Alzheimer observed a patient at the Frankfurt Asylum named
Mrs. Auguste Deter. The 51-year-old patient had strange behavioral symptoms, including a
loss of short-term memory. This patient would become his obsession over the coming years. In
April 1906, Mrs. D. died and Alzheimer had the patient records and the brain sent to Munich
where he was working at Kraepelin's lab. Together with two Italian physicians, he would use
the staining techniques to identify amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles . A speech
given on 3 November 1906 would be the first time the pathology and the clinical symptoms of
presenile dementia would be presented together. Through extremely fortunate
circumstances the original microscope preparations on which Alzheimer based his
description of the disease were rediscovered some years ago in Munich and his findings could
thus be reevaluated.



Walter Spielmeyer (1879-1935): He showed that amaurotic familial idiocy was the result of a
disturbed lipid metabolism and demonstrated primary degeneration of the posterior columns
and cerebral changes in a brilliant monograph on experimental trypanosomiasis. In 1911 he
published his book on microscopic studies of the nervous system which became an important
manual. As a result Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) asked him to come to Munich to succeed Alois
Alzheimer (1864-1915) and head the Anatomisches Laboratorium der Psychiatrischen- und
Nervenklinik (the anatomical laboratories for the psychiratric and nervous disease
clinic). He became extraordinarius in 1913 and director of the histology section of the newly
founded Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fÃŒr Psychiatrie (German Institute for Psychiatric
Research) in 1917 and honorary professor in 1918. Spielmeyer wrote important monographs on
peripheral nerve injuries which occurred in World War I. In 1922 he wrote an important book on
histopathology of the nervous system which was the first textbook of general
histopathology. Later on, Spielmeyer began to explore the possibility that disordered
cerebral function could follow temporary circulation disturbances. In 1928 the
Rockefeller Foundation financed the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute with Spielmeyer as director
of the Hirnpathologisches Institut (Institute of Brain Pathology).



Alfons Maria Jakob (2 July 1884,–17 October 1931): He made notable contributions to
knowledge on concussion and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of
neuropathology .

Jakob published five monographs and more than 75 papers. His neuropathological studies
contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including multiple sclerosis
and Friedreich's ataxia . He first recognised and described Alper's disease and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (the latter with Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt ). He accumulated
immense experience in neurosyphilis , having a 200-bedded ward devoted exclusively to that
disorder. Jakob made a lecture tour of the United States and South America where he wrote a
paper on the neuropathology of yellow fever .



Max Bielschowsky ( February 19 , 1869 – August 15 , 1940 ): Bielschowsky made important
contributions in his research of tuberous sclerosis , amaurotic idiocy, paralysis agitans ,
Huntington’s chorea and myotonia congenita . He is remembered for his pathological work
with sclerosis, the use of an histological silver stain for impregnation of nerve fibers, and
with Stanley Cobb , the development of intravital silver staining. The eponymous
"Bielschowsky silver stain" technique was an improvement on the method developed by Ramon y
Cajal (1852-1934).



Karl Weigert, Carl Weigert ( 1845 - 1904 ): Weigert assisted Cohnheim in many of his
researches, and wrote much on the staining of bacteria in microscopy. He contributed many
essays to medical journals. Among his works are: "Zur Anatomie der Pocken" (Breslau, 1874);
"FÃ€rbung der Bacterien mit Anilinfarben" (ib. 1875); "Nephritis" (Leipzig, 1879);
"FibrinfÃ€rbung" (1886); "BeitrÃ€ge zur Kenntniss der Normalen Menschlichen
Neuroglia" (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1895); "Elastische Fasern" (ib. 1898



Heinrich Obersteiner ( 1847 - 1922 ): Obersteiner was a professor of pathology and anatomy of
the nervous system at the University of Vienna. He was also director of a private mental
institution at OberdÃ¶bling, outside of Vienna. He did extensive work as a psychiatrist
and published articles on several subjects including hypnosis . In 1882 he established the
internationally known Neurological Institute in Vienna.

The eponymous Obersteiner-Redlich line is named after him, along with Emil Redlich
(1866-1930). This zone is where the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system
meet, as well as the place where Schwann cells meet oligodendroglia cells .

Gheorghe Marinescu ( February 28 , 1863 , Bucharest – May 15 , 1938 , Bucharest): Early in his
career he published with the bacteriologist Victor BabeÅŸ and the French pathologist Paul
Oscar Blocq a much needed atlas on the pathological histology of the nervous system. His
description with Blocq of a case of parkinsonian tremor due to tumour in the substantia nigra,
in 1893, was the basis for Ã‰douard Brissaud 's theory that parkinsonism occurs as a
consequence of damage to the substantia nigra. With Paul Blocq he was the first to describe
senile plaques and with Romanian neurologist Ion Minea confirmed in 1913 Hideyo Noguchi 's
discovery of Treponema pallidum in the brain in patients with general paresis . His
monumental work La Cellule Nerveuse, with a preface by Santiago Ramon y Cajal , appeared in
1909.

Arnold Pick ( 1851 – 1924 ) was a German neurologist and psychiatrist . He is known for
identifying the clinical syndrome of Pick's Disease and the Pick bodies that are
characteristic of the disorder . He was the first to name reduplicative paramnesia . He was
also to use the term dementia praecox (in 1891).[



Giovanni Mingazzini (1859-1929): He was habilitated for anatomy in 1889, in 1891 became head
of the pathological-anatomical laboratory at the Manicomio di S. Marco della PietÃš. 1893
he became Dozent in neuropathology and psychiatry, and in 1895 he was appointed to the coveted
position of professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Scuola di Neuropatologia at the
University of Rome, a post keenly sought after by De Sanctis as well. He published excellent
studies on the cerebellum and the striatum.



Paul Ehrlich (14 March 1854 – 20 August 1915): Ehrlich received the Nobel Prize for Medicine
together with Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov in 1908. In 1906 he discovered the structural formula of
atoxyl , a chemical compound which had been shown to be able to treat sleeping sickness .
Following this discovery, he tried to create a less toxic version of the medicament. In 1909 he
and his student Sahachiro Hata developed Salvarsan , a treatment effective against syphilis
. He also studied the vasculature of the central nervous system.



Dr. Walle J.H. Nauta (1916– 1994 ): was a leading neuroscientist . He was an Institute
Professor at MIT . He invented the Nauta Silver Impregnation Method stain, used for tracing
degenerating nerve fibers.



Goldmann 1931, Klatzo et al 1962, Olsson et al 1968, Brightman and Resse 1969, Westergaard
1977, Baloyannis and Gonatas 1979, Baloyannis et al 1982 contributed to the study of the blood
brain barrier while they published excellent works on electron microscopy.

work sold approximately 300,000 copies in the UK and north America between 1828 and 1860, an
astounding number at the time and scarcely matched by any other book regardless of genre. In
contrast, Darwin's Origin of Species (1859) sold only 50,000 in the UK between 1859 and 1900.
Constitution's remarkable sales and the even larger number of people who read or were
familiar with its philosophy of natural law, the amount of critical attention it received,
and its influence make Constitution, and the phrenological naturalism it catered, anything
but peripheral to the history of nineteenth-century Britain. Few book's were more widely
distributed or were so influential in changing the way people conceived of themselves and
Nature.
