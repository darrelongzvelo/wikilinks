Lea Salonga

 

Lea Salonga-Chien (born Maria Lea Carmen Imutan Salonga on February 22 , 1971 in Manila ) is a
Tony Award -winning Filipino singer and actress who is best known for her portrayal of Kim in
the musical Miss Saigon . In the field of musical theater , no other Filipino has achieved the
same international recognition as Salonga. She has been the first to win various
international awards for a single role. She was the first Asian to play Eponine in the musical
Les MisÃ©rables on Broadway , and is is now currently starring as Fantine, as of March 2nd,
2007 . On February 11 , 2007 , she is performing at the Philippine International Convention
Center with the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra . Lea recently released her first studio
album in 7 years called "Inspired". The carrier single is a remake of Beverly Craven's
"Promise Me". The album has just been certified Platinum. Lea Salonga was born to Feliciano
Genuino Salonga and Ligaya Alcantara Imutan. Though born in Manila , she spent the first six
years of her childhood in Angeles City , Pampanga. Salonga became a successful child star in
the Philippines. At the age of seven, she made her professional debut performing in the
musical The King and I by Repertory Philippines . She became the lead star of Annie and joined
other productions, such as: Cat On A Hot Tin Roof , Fiddler on the Roof , The Rose Tattoo , The
Sound Of Music , The Goodbye Girl , Paper Moon and The Fantasticks . She began her recording
career at the age of ten with her first album, Small Voice , which received a Gold
certification. Her younger brother Gerard Salonga performed a duet with her with the song,
Happiness . Since then he has collaborated with her many times as Musical Director or Creative
Director. As a child star, she has also hosted her own musical television show, Love, Lea, and
opened for Stevie Wonder during his 1998 concert in Manila. She won three Aliw Awards for Best
Child Performer from 1981 to 1983. In 1983, her sophomore album, "Lea" was released. She was
also starred in German Moreno 's teen variety show That's Entertainment . The young Lea also
appeared with Herbert Bautista in several popular family-oriented Filipino films in the
late 1980s such as Ninja Kids , Captain Barbell and Pik Pak Boom . Lea Salonga also received her
first Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences ( FAMAS Awards ) award nomination
(equivalent of an Oscar nomination) for Best Child Actress for the 1981 flick Tropang Bulilit
, though she lost to child star Sheryl Cruz for Mga Basang Sisiw . Salonga's big breakthrough
came when she was selected to play Kim in the musical Miss Saigon in 1989 . After not finding a
strong enough Asian actress/singer in the United Kingdom , the producers scoured many Asian
countries looking for the lead role of this major British production. For her audition,
Salonga chose to sing Boublil and SchÃ¶nberg 's " On My Own " from "Les Miserables," and was
later asked to sing "Sun and Moon" to test her voice quality's compatibility with the songs in
the musical. The members of the panel were "bowled over" by Salonga's rendition of the songs.
After auditioning Salonga and Monique Wilson with songs from the musical, Salonga was
offered the lead role and Wilson the alternate lead, as well as a regular minor role. For her
performance as Kim, Salonga won the Olivier for Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical for
the 1989/1990 season. From its original London home, Miss Saigon moved to Broadway in April
1991 . Salonga subsequently garnered the Tony , Drama Desk , and Outer Critics Circle Awards
for the same role. In 1993, Salonga played the role of street waif Eponine in the Broadway
production of Les MisÃ©rables , then flew to Los Angeles to perform the song "A Whole New
World" (of Disney 's Aladdin ) at the 65th Annual Academy Awards , where the song won an Oscar.
(Salonga sang the song in the movie as the singing voice of Princess Jasmine.) In the same year
she released her self-titled international debut album with Atlantic Records , which sold
slowly in the USA but went platinum in the Philippines and sold 3 million copies worldwide. In
1995 Salonga performed as Geri Riordan, an 18-year old adopted Vietnamese-American child in
the movie Redwood Curtain , which starred John Lithgow and Jeff Daniels . Back in the
Philippines, she starred with Filipino matinee idol Aga Muhlach in the
critically-acclaimed film Sana Maulit Muli . Her poignant portrayal of Agnes in the film gave
her a second Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences ( FAMAS Awards ) award nomination,
this time for Best Actress. She lost to Philippine drama queen Maricel Soriano for her
performance as a troubled battered wife in Dahas . Salonga was invited by Sir Cameron
Mackintosh to play the role of Eponine for the 10th Anniversary concert of Les Miserables at
London's Royal Albert Hall . Salonga performed as part of a "dream cast" composed of Colm
Wilkinson , Michael Ball , Judy Kuhn , and Philip Quast . Salonga then acted in various musical
theater productions around the Philippines and Singapore . She notably starred as Sandy in
Grease , Sonia Walsk in They're Playing Our Song , The Witch in Into The Woods , and Lizzie in Baby
. In 1997, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing" (recordings from her childhood days) was
released to gold sales in the Philippines. It was followed up by "Lea... In Love" in 1998. "By
Heart" followed two years later, both albums reaching multiple platinum status in the
Philippines. In 2001, Salonga had a grand homecoming via the Manila production of Miss Saigon
staged at the Cultural Center of the Philippines . That same year and again in 2003 , Salonga
recreated the role of Lien Hughes on the soap opera As the World Turns , which was originally
played by Ming-Na Wen years before. She also made a guest appearance in the medical drama E.R. ,
playing the role of a patient with Lymphoma . In 2002 Salonga returned to broadway to play the
role of a Chinese immigrant in a reinterpretation of Rogers and Hammerstein 's Flower Drum
Song opposite Jose Llana . The show was given a brand new libretto which presented Asian
Americans with more dignity than the original but it also played with the stereotypes. It was
considered one of the 10 best plays on Broadway in 2002 by Time Magazine . The musical, which had
a short run on Broadway, later on garnered nominations for Best Book, Best Costume Designer,
and Best Choreographer. However, Ms. Salonga's performance, which received mixed reviews,
was not nominated at the Tony Award. In February and March 2005 , Salonga played her first US
concert tour in San Francisco , Los Angeles , Atlantic City , and Chicago . Dates in Washington,
D.C. , and Norfolk, Virginia followed in July 2005 . On November 7 , 2005 , Salonga performed
with a 26-piece ensemble to a sold out crowd of 2,804 at the Isaac Stern Hall in Carnegie Hall for
the benefit of Diverse City Theater Company. Salonga is only the third Filipino solo artist to
perform at the venue (the first was Regine Velasquez followed by Jose Mari Chan ). In honor of
her international achievements, the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences bestowed
her with the Golden Artist Award on June 26, 2005 in the 53rd FAMAS Awards. The award is given to
Filipino performers who received international acclaim and prestige from their work. Lea
Salonga accepted the award and serenaded Filipino audiences with her rendition of "As If We
Never Said Goodbye" from the musical Sunset Boulevard . Salonga's Disney film credits
include the singing voice of Princess Jasmine for Aladdin (1992), and Fa Mulan for Mulan
(1998), as well as the voice of Mrs. Kusakabe (Satsuki and Mei's mother) in Disney's 2005
English dub of Hayao Miyazaki 's My Neighbor Totoro . Salonga has performed for three American
Presidents ( George H. W. Bush , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush ) and for Her Majesty, Queen
Elizabeth II . In the the 15th Asian Games held in Doha , Qatar on December 15 , 2006 , the closing
ceremony concluded with a song "Triumph of the One" sung by Salonga at the Khalifa Stadium
before of an audience of 50,000 people. On January 3 , 2007 it was announced that Salonga will
return to Broadway in the musical Les Miserables replacing Daphne Rubin-Vega as Fantine . On
January 10 , 2004 , Salonga married Robert Charles Chien, a Chinese - Japanese managing
director of an entertainment software company in Los Angeles , California . Their daughter,
Nicole Beverly, was born on May 16 , 2006 . She was named after Lea Salonga's late mother-in-law
, Beverly Chien.

Apl.de.Ap

 

Allan Pineda Lindo, (b. 28 November 1974 ) better known as apl.de.ap , is a hip hop musician and
member of the The Black Eyed Peas . He was born in the Barangay (Barrio) of Sapangbato, Angeles
City , Pampanga , in the Philippines , to a Filipina mother and an African-American father.
Apl.de.Ap is an original member of the hip hop group The Black Eyed Peas . He is the main composer
of Black Eyed Peas. His father, who was a U.S. serviceman stationed at nearby Clark Air Base ,
abandoned the family shortly after his birth. His mother, Christina Pineda, raised him and
his four brothers and two sisters on her own in their small barrio. Music had always been part of
Aplâ€™s life, his early influences having been Stevie Wonder, The Eagles, The Beatles
and the popular Filipino rock/folk group, Asin . Hip-hop soon came into the picture via the
breakdancing , "I would take the jeepney all the way to Angeles City, and that's how I got
introduced to break dancing," he said. "I would see kids at the corner break-dancing and I'm
like, 'I wanna do that.'" At the age of 14, he was adopted by an American family, and moved to Los
Angeles, California , leaving behind his birth family and country. It was a gloomy departure
for the young man. "I left in the afternoon, and it was the saddest sunset ever. I didn't know
where I was going. I was 14, and I'm getting on this plane by myself, and I could see the sun
setâ€Š." Getting used to his new home took some time for Allan especially as a new,
biracial immigrant. "I would get chased from junior high school to my house every day," he
recalled. "All these kids are like, 'Where you from?' And I was like, 'From Philippines.'
There were many moments of loneliness and culture shock, going from an environment he calls
"very country -- all farms and water buffaloes" to the smog-filled streets of Los Angeles. To
help him adapt to life in America, Allan's adoptive father asked a friend's sister to care for
him while he went to work. She brought along her 13-year-old son, Will (aka will.i.am ), who
quickly bonded with Allan over a shared love of music and dance. "Will was the very first friend
I made in Los Angeles," says Allan. Given his feelings of ostracization, he mentioned, "You
know, I could have easily joined the gangs that were surrounding me. I was exposed to that. But I
chose dancing instead. That led me in a good direction. The pair soon formed a break-dancing
crew called Tribal Nation and were regularly performing at Southern California parties and
events. As their partnership evolved, they added another performer, Dante Santiago (part of
the group from 1992-1995) and the name of their crew turned into Atban Klann (ATBAN stands for
"A Tribe Beyond a Nation"), and became part of L.A.'s hip-hop/break-dance circuit,
eventually being signed onto Eazy-E â€™s label, Ruthless Records . Their debut album,
"Grass Roots", was never released because Ruthless did not consider the social themes
reflected in the group's music to be marketable to their audience. After Eazy-E's AIDS
-related death in 1995 , Dante left ATBAN and by 1998 , a Mexican/Native American rapper named
Jaime "Taboo" Gomez joined the mix and the group renamed themselves the Black Eyed Peas.
Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a unique musical
and clothing style that differed wildly from the "Gangsta rap" sounds of other Los
Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Their first album, Behind the Front was released in
1998 to critical acclaim and was followed by Bridging the Gap in 2000 featuring a guest
appearance by Macy Gray as well as members of Jurassic 5 and De La Soul . After two albums, the
group brought in R&B singer Fergie, a.k.a. Stacy Ferguson, for " Elephunk ". He explains his
life story in a song called " The Apl Song " found on the Peas' 2003 album Elephunk (track 11).
This song has a full chorus in Tagalog (Filipino) taken from the Asin song "Balita." "Coming
from the Philippines my whole goal was to support my family and have a better living
situation," he said. "Trying to pursue my dream took up a lot of my time, and I got separated from
my family a little bit ... I was separated from my brothers and sisters. Some good things
happened to them and some bad things happened to some of them." This is in reference to the
suicide of his younger brother Arnel, a heartbreaking event he recalls in the song. Its
accompanying video, which reached number one in the Philippines, with its cameo appearances
by fellow Fil-Ams, Dante Basco and Chad Hugo , is also a tribute to the Filipinos who fought for
the U.S. in World War II . "Bebot" is another all-Tagalog song on 2005's Monkey Business album.
A music video for "Bebot" was filmed in early July 2006 and premiered online on August 4 , 2006 .
The video was directed by Patricio Ginelsa (Kid Heroes Productions) who also directed "The
Apl Song" and produced the Filipino-American coming of age movie, "The Debut" . The Bebot
music video was filmed in various locations in Los Angeles, CA, one location including
Kenneth Hahn Park, where Dr. Dre 's "Nothing But A G Thang" video was also filmed. The term
"Bebot" is Filipino slang for "pretty woman", "hot chick", "hottie", "baby/babe". The video
for Bebot features primarily Filipinos , Filipino-Americans and several other Asian
ethnicities from the Los Angeles area (Korean-Americans, Japanese-Americans,
Chinese-Americans, Thai-Americans, Indonesian-Americans, Vietnamese-Americans,
etc.). The single was not released in the US but was in the Philippines and several other Asian
countries. Patricio Ginelsa actually produced and directed two versions of the "Bebot"
music video: Generations One and Two. "Generation One" [1] is a tribute to the "Manongs,"
(Filipino for "respected elder brother") Filipino farm workers who first started coming to
the US when the Philippines became its colony in the early 1900s. They came in search of a better
life and an education, but racism and discrimination prevented these mostly young men from
going to school and forced most of them to work the fields of California, the canneries of
Alaska and elsewhere for very low wages. Excluded from many public places by whites until as
late as the mid 1960s with signs saying things like, "Positively no Filipinos allowed," the
Manongs formed vibrant communities of their own. Little Manila in Stockton, California
became the largest one in the US during the 1920s right up to the 1960s. "Generation One" is set
in 1930s Stockton with apl.de.ap playing a "Manong" spending time at the historic Rizal
Social Club singing and dancing after a long day of back-breaking stoop work in the fields. The
Generation One music video did not see air time in the US but was released on Youtube . He is also
planning to release a solo album of his own. Some of his songs are uploaded on his MySpace .

Jasmine Soriano Trias (born November 3 , 1986 ) is an American singer and entertainer who was
the third-place finalist on the third season of American Idol due in part to tremendous
call-in support from California, New York, and her native state of Hawaii (source: * USA TODAY
). She has released two albums to date, one in the United States and one in the Philippines .
Trias was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and raised in the Central Oahu suburb of Mililani . She is the
eldest daughter of Filipino immigrants to the state of Hawaii from Tanza , Cavite . Trias
attended Maryknoll School , a Roman Catholic preparatory school of the Diocese of Honolulu .
As a representative of Maryknoll School, she won the Brown Bags to Stardom 2001 state singing
competition and the Road to Fame 2003 youth talent competition. Trias graduated from
Maryknoll School in June 2004 . Jasmine is planning to move to Los Angeles, California to begin
her professional singing career. After Trias' appearance on American Idol , her fanbase grew
in the United States in foreign countries where the show was aired: Australia , Hong Kong ,
Malaysia , Indonesia , Philippines , Singapore , and Taiwan , among others. The Manila Times
newspaper captured the mood of her ancestral country in an April headline, "Everybody Wants
Jasmine." During the American Idol season, hundreds of internet fan sites from over a dozen
countries were established in several Asian and European languages. Managing Director of
Honolulu Ben Lee summarized the mood in Trias' home state of Hawaii by saying, "Jasmine has
enough votes in Hawai'i to become governor or mayor easily." Lieutenant Governor James Aiona
, in his capacity as acting governor, declared Jasmine Trias Day by executive order. In the
Philippines, Trias has done television commercials and billboard ads for McDonald's, Smart
Telecommunications, Hapee Toothpaste, and Bench Clothing. On October 6 , 2004 , Trias
released a promotional single for McDonald's entitled "Love Ko 'To" (the local translation
of McDonald's " i'm lovin' it " slogan). McDonald's restaurants in the Philippines offered a
promotional meal called the "Jasmine Trio", which consisted of a Strawberry Float, fries,
and the McDonald's exclusive Love Ko 'To CD-Single. Jasmine has also done various
commercials in Hawaii discouraging smoking, drinking, and drug use. Trias headlined tours
in Manila , San Francisco , Los Angeles, and Guam in 2004. To end her whirlwind visit to the
Philippines, dubbed "Jasmania," she met President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo . On February 27
, 2005 , Trias released a CD single entitled "Flying Home," which was sold exclusively in Pizza
Hut and Taco Bell stores in Hawaii. The single was intended to capture her feelings of
returning to Hawaii after months of working on tour and on her album. Trias was a part of the
JCPenney and Seventeen "Rock Your Prom" Fashion Show. She performed in Springfield,
Missouri and Glendale, California in March 2005. Trias signed a record deal with Clockwork
Entertainment, a company which has worked with Dream and Bad Boy Records (headed by P. Diddy ),
to record and produce her debut album. She also signed a record deal with Universal Records for
the album's release in the Philippines. Her self-titled debut album with Clockwork
Entertainment was released on July 12 , 2005 in the U.S. . It has since sold 30,000 copies. She
has since been certified platinum in the Philippines. Trias also appeared on GMA Network 's

feature film Wayne's World ( 1992 ). Born in Honolulu, Hawaii of Filipino , Chinese , and
Spanish heritage, Carrere longed to be a singer as a child. Although she was eliminated during
the first round of her 1985 Star Search appearance at the age of 17, she was spotted by the
parents of a local producer while shopping at a Waikiki grocery store and was cast in the
b-movie Zombie Nightmare . Following this initial success, Carrere relocated to Los Angeles
and, after working several months as a model, landed a role in the daytime soap opera General
Hospital . She played the role from 1985 to 1987. During this time, she also had a guest
appearance on The A-Team , which was supposed to lead to her joining the cast. Unfortunately,
her General Hospital obligations prevented her from joining the team. Her character was
dropped after one episode, and was never mentioned again. She also made guest appearances on
the shows MacGyver ("The Wish Child") as a sexy karate instructor, and Married... with
Children as Piper Bauman, a rival of Kelly Bundy 's who attempted to steal a modeling job from
her. After appearing in the 1991 action film Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man and Showdown
in Little Tokyo , she emerged into the public spotlight when cast as Cassandra, a rock singer
and love interest of Mike Myers ' character Wayne in Wayne's World (1992) - a role she reprised
the next year in Wayne's World 2 . A trained singer, Carrere performed all of her own songs in the
two films, and the Wayne's World soundtrack features her vocals. She turned down a role in
Baywatch to audition for Wayne's World . In 1992 People magazine named her to its annual "50
most beautiful people" list. On November 22 , 1992 , Carrere married Italian/Lebanese
producer Elie Samaha (she has since appeared in several of his films - none of which have
achieved widespread success). Other roles in prominent films followed her role in Wayne's
World , however, including the parts of terrorist Juno Skinner in True Lies (a 1994 Arnold
Schwarzenegger action film), robber Gina Walker in The Immortals (1995), and secretary
Victoria Chapell in High School High (a 1996 parody). From 1999 to 2002, Tia Carrere starred as
archeology professor Sydney Fox in Relic Hunter , an action-adventure series reminiscent of
the Indiana Jones films. At this time, Carrere was featured in lad mag Maxim magazine. Relic
Hunter , now syndicated, lasted for a total of three television seasons before its
cancellation. Carrere then provided the voice of Lilo's sister "Nani" in the animated film
Lilo and Stitch (2002) and its spinoffs, as well as the voice of Queen Tyr'ahnee from the 2003
Duck Dodgers animated series. She also starred as Ari, a space marine-turned pirate in the
1995 adventure/puzzle game Daedalus Encounter . Despite using a body double for her nude
scenes in Showdown in Little Tokyo , Carrere modeled nude for the January 2003 issue of Playboy
magazine. The photo's were re-published in the German December 2006 issue of the magazine. In
2007, she is set to have a recurring role on Curb Your Enthusiasm . Carrere has continued to
nurture her singing career. In 1993, her first solo album, Dream , was released, and went
platinum in the Philippines . That same year, she was featured on the soundtrack of Batman:
Mask of the Phantasm , performing the ending theme, "I Never Even Told You". In August of 2003,
Carrere was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by Philippine president Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo , and she is reportedly working on a new album in her home studio. Carrere

September 25 , 2005 . Presently, she lives in Toronto, Canada . She participated as a

With a golf handicap of four, he even considered going pro after graduation, but instead
decided to go to college. While in college, he landed his first job at Disney World with friend
and colleague, Wayne Brady . It was at 21, while hanging out with Wayne at clubs and entering
club dance contests after work, that Cris first discovered that he was a natural on the dance
floor. Within a year, Cris switched jobs and began dancing professionally with Disney. He
quickly began to get noticed on a national level and, based solely on a word-of-mouth
recommendation, was hired to dance with Michael Jackson for the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards .
Cris was an instant hit. He was offered a coveted spot dancing with Michael on both the
Dangerous and History tours, rapidly moving up to lead dancer for the tour. Cris' dance and

It Funny-Remix with Ja Rule . Leaping forward yet again, Cris then stepped in as Creative
Director for Handprint Entertainment, overseeing a $5 million budget and delivering NBC's
hugely successful concert special "Let's Get Loud." Cris has also ventured into composing
where his first song, "Alive," was selected as the theme song for the movie Enough (Sony

was flown out there and hired to direct the music video " Love Don't Cost a Thing " for her. They
were married on September 29 , 2001 . The marriage ended in June 2002 when Jennifer Lopez
reportedly started dating Ben Affleck . Selected as one of People Magazine's "25 Hottest
Bachelors" and InTouch Magazine's "20 Hottest Hunks," most of America remembers Cris'
television debut on "I'm a Celebrity - Get Me Out of Here" where he won the hearts of millions of
viewers and earned $200,000 for the Make-a-Wish Foundation when he was crowned "King of the
Jungle" in a landslide viewer vote. On the acting front, Cris has two new feature film projects
in the works slated to shoot this spring, along with more sitcom guest-starring appearances.
He partnered up with Universal , Dean Cain and long-time choreography partner, Eddie Garcia,
to produce an interactive dance DVD which was released in summer 2005, and has prepared the
Midnight Fantasy musical for the Luxor Resort in Las Vegas . In 2006, Cris was one of the judges
for the NFL Cheerleader Playoffs that was televised on NFL Network. The 2nd round of the
competition had him not only judging, but coaching the contestants...giving each pair of
cheerleaders a little bit of advice.

that she was going to pursue her career in modeling and music, foregoing college.

In New York - where Ventura was modeling for Abercrombie and Fitch - she took classes at the

Billboard' s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Follow-up single " Long Way 2 Go " was far less
successful in comparison, peaking at ninety-seven on the Billboard Hot 100.

Mutya Buena

 

Rosa Isabel Mutya Buena , (born 21 May 1985 , London , England ) is a former member of the pop band
Sugababes . Buena and close friend Keisha Buchanan met SiobhÃ¡n Donaghy at a party in 1998,
when they were thirteen. Soon after, they decided to form a band. Buena recorded four albums
with the Sugababes: One Touch , Angels with Dirty Faces , Three and Taller in More Ways .
Following an apparent illness that prevented her from promoting the single "Ugly", it was
announced on December 21 , 2005 that Buena had left Sugababes. According to an announcement on
their website, "Mutya's decision is based purely on personal reasons and she will continue to
remain the best of friends with both Keisha and Heidi." She has been replaced by Amelle
Berrabah . Many fans have reacted negatively towards the new Sugababes line up as Mutya was
seen as the lead member of the band. Many critics praised the band during Mutya's time as she
gave "attitude" and "presence" to the band, something of which was lacking in most girl
groups. The Buena family currently lives in Kingsbury , North West London. Mutya was raised by
her Irish mother and Filipino father. Her name "Mutya" was derived from same Tagalog word
which means "a Pearl ". She has five brothers (Bayani, Charlie, Chris, Danny and Roberto) and
two younger sisters, Ligaya and Dalisay. Another sister, Maya, died in 2002 , and the song
"Maya" on the album Three is dedicated to her. On March 23, 2005, she gave birth to 5lb 10oz
Tahlia Maya, her first child with boyfriend Jay. A fter leaving the Sugababes in December
2005, Buena began working on material for a solo career. Her Myspace page appeared on April
25th and has been used to chat with fans, friends and colleagues and also features demo tracks,
which are rumoured to be on her upcoming album, entitled: "Love Story", "2 The Limit",
"Wonderful", "Darkside", "Suffer 4 Love", "Sunshine", "Addiction", "Paperbag", "Strung
Out", "Where You'll Find Me" and "Song 4 Mutya (Out Of Control)" featuring Groove Armada.

Whilst solo, Mutya has collaborated with numerous artists including Tah Mac , MC Viper ,
George Michael and Groove Armada for their forthcoming albums and greatest hits. "This Is Not
Real Love", a sultry ballad with alternating verses between Michael and Buena, was released
in December as part of George Michael's Greatest Hits Album, 25. No video was made and this,
along with little publicity, caused the single to be placed in the latter end of the top twenty.
Mutya later featured on Tah Mac 's album track "Give Back", although it is unknown if it will
become a single. Most recently she has featured on a track for Groove Armada 's upcoming album,
Soundboy Rock. The track, Song 4 Mutya (Out Of Control), was highly praised by leading music
journalist and Popjustice creator, Peter Robinson. After leaving the Sugababes, Buena
signed with her previous label Universal Records , specifically Island Records . Mutya's
upcoming album," Real Girl " ,current release date 4th of June, is rumoured to include
collaborations with Johnny Douglas , Justin Timberlake and Pharrell . A cosmopolitan
interview later revealed that the first single will be called " Real Girl ", released on the
16th of April. The single is produced by Full Phatt, a London based production company who have
remixed many singles including Jojo 's "Too Little Too Late". Confirmed tracks for the album
include: Real Girl, Not Your Baby, Strung Out, Paperbag and Hollow, a ballad rejected by
Britney Spears as it didn't suit her voice. The album is also set to feature a duet with Amy
Winehouse , a similar sounding pop star on the same label, and tracks produced by British Dance
sensation Groove Armada. According to a message from Mutya herself on MySpace, a track titled
"Call Back, Or Drop Dead" (a song previously offered to Ciara but then later on to Mutya) is
going to be on the album. It's supposedly a very "crunk" tune similar to the Sugababes track
"Gotta Be You" but with more powerful dance beats. The album will be released in June, with the
lead single as it's title. Mutya can be seen in the advertisement as a part of the channel 4 new
music month along with fellow british female acts such as Lady Sovereign , Sophie Ellis Bextor
, and Natasha Bedingfield .

Manny Pacquiao (born Emmanuel Dapigran Pacquiao on December 17 , 1978 in Bukidnon , Mindanao ,
Philippines ), also known as the Pacman , is a Filipino professional boxer and the reigning WBC
International Super Featherweight defending champion. He is a former world champion at IBF
Super Bantamweight and WBC Flyweight divisions. Pacquiao has a record of 43 wins, 3 losses,
and 2 draws , with 34 wins coming by way of knockout . His brother, Bobby Pacquiao is also a Super
Featherweight boxer. Pacquiao started his professional boxing career in 1995 at 106 pounds.
His early fights were usually in small venue were shown on Vintage Sports' evening boxing show
Blow by Blow hosted by John Ray Betita . He became an instant star of the program. His weight
increased from 106 to 113 pounds before losing in his 12th bout against Rustico Torrecampo via
a third round technical knockout (TKO). During the fight as commented by well-known sports
newscaster Joaquin "Quinito" Henson , Pacquiao clearly did not make the weight so he was
forced to use heavier gloves than that of Torrecampo which served as a disadvantage. Shortly
after the Torrecampo fight Pacquiao settled at 112 pounds, winning the WBC Flyweight title
over Chatchai Sasakul only to lose it in his second defense against Medgoen Singsurat , or
Medgoen 3K Battery, via a third round knockout on a bout held at Nakhon Si Thammarat , Thailand .
Technically, Pacquiao lost the belt at the scales by surpassing the required weight of 112 lb
(51 kg). Following his loss to Singsurat, Pacquiao gained weight anew, this time stopping at
the super bantamweight division of 122 lb (55 kg) where he picked up the WBC International
Super Bantamweight title, defending it five times before his next world title fight came.
Pacquiaoâ€™s big break came on June 23 , 2001 , against IBF Super Bantamweight champion
Lehlohonolo Ledwaba . Pacquiao stepped into the fight as a late replacement and walked out of
the fight as the newly crowned IBF Super Bantamweight champion on a bout held at MGM Grand , Las
Vegas, Nevada . Pacquiao went on to defend his title four times before the match that many
consider to have defined his career, against the Mexican boxing idol, Marco Antonio Barrera
of Mexico . Pacquiao defeated Barrera via a TKO in the 11th round at the Alamodome , San Antonio,
Texas . Only six months removed from his win over Barrera, Pacquiao went on to challenge
another respected Mexican brawler, Juan Manuel MÃ¡rquez , holder of the World Boxing
Association (WBA) and International Boxing Federation (IBF) Featherweight titles. The
fight held at the MGM Grand ended in a controversial draw after he knocked down MÃ¡rquez
three times on the first round, but lost most of the latter rounds.

In a bout held at Taguig City , Philippines, Pacquiao fought against Fahsan (3K-Battery) Por
Thawatchai. Pacquiao sent Por Thawatchai to the canvas three times en route to a knockout in
the fourth round. A left uppercut to the jaw knocked down the Thai fighter that lifted his two
feet off the canvas and ended the fight. Pacquiao once again tipped the scales at 130 pounds in
order to fight another Mexican fighter, three-time division champion Erik Morales on March
19 , 2005 at the MGM Grand. However, Pacquiao lost the 12 round match by a unanimous decision
from the judges. On September 10 , 2005 , Manny Pacquiao knocked out Hector VelÃ¡zquez ,
capturing the WBC International Super Featherweight title in the process on a fight held at
Staples Center , Los Angeles, California . Pacquiao defeated Erik Morales by TKO in a
much-anticipated rematch on January 21 , 2006 in Las Vegas at Thomas and Mack Center . After the
Morales bout, Pacquiao was in the limelight again during the first week of February 2006 when a
prostitute working in a Manila night club claimed that he was the father of her son, born out of a
whirlwind affair with the boxer. Allegedly, the boxer was not giving her child financial
support, prompting her to sue Pacquiao and demanding P 250,000,000 ($5,159,958) in child
support. On March 21 Pacquiao was sent to the hospital due to liver problems, brought about by
his bar-hopping, womanizing, various product endorsements, and billiards playing
(Pacquiao even qualified in the final stages of Philippine 9-ball Open). Pacquiao's trainer
Freddie Roach had commented earlier about his concerns of Pacquiao's late night lifestyle
and warned that the boxer is in danger of losing both his edge and his focus. Roach noted that
there are too many distractions surrounding Pacquiao in the Philippines, including
sponsorship deals, personal appearances, nocturnal activities as well as his circle of
friends. On July 2 , Pacquiao defeated another Mexican, Oscar Larios , a two-time
super-bantamweight champion. Despite his camp's big promise of an early knockout, the fight
went the distance with Pacquiao knocking down the Mexican two times during the 12-round bout
for the WBC International Super Featherweight title held at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon
City , Philippines. In September 2006, Pacquiao signed a major deal with Golden Boy
Promotions (GBP), headed by Oscar de la Hoya , which is good for seven fights. This development
was confirmed by coach Freddie Roach. Under the deal, Pacquiao is guaranteed a prize money of
US$5 million for each fight. With regard to profits made on each fight, Pacquiao will be
receiving at least 90% while the remaining 10% will go to Golden Boy Promotions. Pacquiao and
Morales fought for a third time (with the "series" tied 1-all) on November 18 , 2006 . Witnessed
by a near-record crowd of 18,276, the match saw Pacquiao defeating Morales via a third-round
knockout at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. After the Pacquiao-Morales rematch, Arum
announced that Manny returned his signing bonus check back with Golden Boy Promotions
signalling intentions to stay with Top Rank. This resulted in GBP's decision to sue the famed
fighter over contractual breaches. After a failed promotional negotiation with Marco
Antonio Barrera 's camp, Bob Arum chose Jorge Solis as his next opponent among several
fighters that Bob Arum offered him to fight as a replacement. The bout is scheduled to be held in
San Antonio sometime in April 15, 2007 . He was lately named by both HBO and Ring Magazine as the
fighter of the year. HBO also named him as the most exciting fighter of the year. Pacquiao won
the April 15, 2007 bout with Jorge Solis during the 8th round.

Billy Crawford (born Billy Joe Crawford on May 16, 1982) is a Filipino American musician and
actor with musical influences from R&B , Pop , and Soul . Billy Crawford became known around
Europe and Asia with song titles such as "When You Think About Me", "Steamy Nights" and "Bright
Lights". Billy is also known for being multilingual; speaking in three languages Tagalog -
his native language, English, and French. He is also close friends with singers Lemar , Justin
Timberlake and the rest of the singers in *NSYNC . Billy has been living in New York City since
1998 until this present time. Billy Crawford was born in Manila , Philippines to a Filipina
mother named Mayette and an American father named Jack and he has a half-brother named John.
Billy was discovered at an early age of 3 years, singing at a bowling alley that his mother
visited often. He would become a series regular on an afternoon television show called That's
Entertainment under the name Billy Joe . He acted in a few movies, moved to the United States at
age 11 years, and started a music career, performing mostly in the United Kingdom and France ,
as well as in Asia. His pre-career started in Dallas, Texas where he lived and performed his
singing and then moved to New York City. During this time he legally changed his name to Billy
Crawford , giving an alias name for himself. He went to school where lots of other famous
children also attended. Just a few names: Mandy Moore, Macauley Culkin (the main character
from the movie "Home Alone"), Nina Sky and with many other famous people. In 1996 Billy danced
with Michael Jackson on-stage when he was 14 years old and appeared as one of his backup dancers
at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards . He previously dated Mandy Moore for about several months (a
year almost) when he was 17 and she was 15. He recorded his first album called "Billy Crawford"
when he was 15 years old and it went straight into the charts at the Philippines.
Unfortunately, his foreign career didn't last too long. After a year, everyone began to
forget who he was at that time. He took a small break at first. Billy had a few physical accidents
during that time and he was in the hospital. When he was released from it, he fainted and fell off
the stairs in front of it, and got back in the hospital the same day with a broken jaw (which
healed successfully). His quiet break already lasted more than 3 years. Billy decided to make
a new album and he actually wanted to start over. He changed his hairstyle and started
recording at the studio for his second album: "Ride" and that's where his European career
began. Billy was a success as a singer in France with his first single of this album called
"Trackin'" which was number one in the Netherlands and France (he had a connection with French
singer Lorie at that time), he is almost unknown in the United States and in the rest of the
world. His second single "When You Think About Me" , was also a huge success, and many other
successes followed. He had major chart success in France and other parts of Europe, but did not
repeat this success in the United Kingdom and the United States, although his single "You
Didn't Expect That" did make the lower reaches of the UK Top 40, peaking at number 35. He also
contributed a remix of the PokÃ©mon anime theme for the first movie in the series which, for
the first time in the United States, he was beginning to be known. Billy has also appeared at a
popular Filipino American event called "Fiesta Filipina" in 2001 held in San Francisco ,
California and American people have become more aware of his name. Billy's latest album "Big
City" was released in 2004 in France and Asia only. The single "Bright Lights" was unable to
break into the any Top 10 charts. The second single "Steamy Nights", fared better making Top
40, and was featured on 7 compilations across Europe and was the first single in Germany.
Billy's music video for "Steamy Nights" was shot in Los Angeles , California and was produced
with the same people who worked on the Destiny's Child single "Loose My Breath". Actress Jenna
Dewan from the popular 2006 movie Step Up (film) was featured as one of Billy's main dance
partners. Another song from the album Candy Store was leaked from the album and received
airplay on London radio. Thought to be a duet with Ginuwine, it is featured on the Big City
album. After doing the first ever online reality show "the MSN Dance Show", his third single
from Big City "3 Wishes" got cancelled by his label. Billy felt it was time for something new and
decided not to re-sign his contract with V2 records. Right now he's writing and producing
songs for other artists. One of his songs recently got bought by Britney Spears . Crawford did
not receive significant media attention after the Big City Tour 2005, mostly being mentioned
in a few magazines for his break-up with Lorie , and new relationship with Maryss (also known as
Maryss from Paris ), a dancer he met when she auditioned for the Big City tour. Maryss currently
resides in Los Angeles, California and Billy takes occasional visits there. In 2006, Billy
began recording a new album which was expected to be released in 2007. In 2006, he toured over
the summer with the L5 in France and in November he was scheduled to return to his home country to
shoot a film. Billy's new album is confirmed to be titled S.T.A.T.U.S. , which is scheduled to
be released in late 2007. Recently, he came back to the Philippines for a new dance reality show
M.O.V.E for GMA 7 . This show is a reality search for Billy's back-up dancers. But not yet shown
and GMA is still planning for it. He is now on guesting at different shows of local TV in the
Philippines. His 2007 concert in the Philippines was arranged for August but has now been
moved to October 6, 2007 at Araneta Coliseum in Manila, Philippines.

Reggie Lee

Reggie Lee is a Filipino -American actor. He played William Kim on the show Prison Break and
also appeared in two Pirates of the Caribbean films, as well as The Fast and the Furious . Lee,
the oldest of three sons, was born in Quezon City , Philippines to Zenaida Telmo and Dr. Jesus
Espiritu Valdez, a retired Ob-Gyn . He continues to speak Tagalog , his native language, as
well as Cantonese . As a child, the family moved to Cleveland , Ohio where Reggie graduated from
a Franciscan High School. The 1990s found Lee relocating to Los Angeles only to hit the road
again and tour nationally in the musical Heartstrings and later in Miss Saigon . With his
tremendous success on stage, it is no surprise that Broadway came calling when he was cast in
the original company of the Tony Award-winning musical, Carousel . In 1997, he received a
Dramalogue Critics Award for his performance in F.O.B. at East West Players . With his
critical acclaim, Lee also starred in their production of Carry the Tiger to the Mountain .
Since having starred as Lance Nguyen â€“ the snakeskin-wearing, motorcycle-riding,
cold-blooded killer â€“ in Universalâ€™s high-octane blockbuster The Fast and
the Furious , Lee has been on his way to screen success. He recently finished filming a
supporting lead role in the highly anticipated Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End , the
third installment to Disney â€™s incredibly successful Pirates of the Caribbean
series. Lee also plays Special Secret Service Agent Bill Kim in the popular FOX drama Prison
Break - a character he describes as "a guilty pleasure to play â€“ wonderfully complex
and devious". And later this year, Lee stars in the independent feature Chinaman's Chance
opposite Timothy Bottoms, Danny Trejo, Theresa Russell, and Ernest Borgnine.
â€œItâ€™s an important story that definitely needs to be told and
humanized,â€� says Lee of this film that is billed as a Western/ Drama. â€œPlus I get
to play pretend in the Old West. How great is that?!â€� "In The Fast and the Furious , Rick
Yune (of Die Another Day ) and I played the leaders of a gang that rivaled Vin Dieselâ€™s
character.â€� In contrast, that same year Lee starred as the gay romantic lead in the
critically acclaimed independent film Drift â€“ a relationship drama that the Los
Angeles Times hailed and that LA Weekly proclaimed, "itâ€™s Reggie Leeâ€™s
performance that rivets". "I always enjoy the opportunity to play roles that are the opposite
of who I really am because, for me, finding the character and playing pretend is the real joy in
all this," says Lee of The Fast and the Furious danger-boy role, the ultra-vulnerable
character of Ryan that he plays in Drift, and the young man that comes of age through seemingly
insurmountable obstacles that he gets to play in Chinamanâ€™s Chance. "Itâ€™s
what keeps me going." Lee has also appeared in the Sony Pictures Classics release Masked and
Anonymous with Bob Dylan, starred in the Sci-Fi Channel thriller Frankenfish , and the indie
X.C.U. (Extreme Close-Up) with Sarah Chalke (NBCâ€™s Scrubs). In addition to his work
in feature films, Lee also played the role of Zhing Zhang in the FOX comedy LUIS opposite Luis
Guzman. He was Officer Jim Chang on Lifetimeâ€™s The Division, Dr. Oliver Lee on CBS
â€™ Judging Amy and Assistant District Attorney Brian Chin on ABC â€™s Philly.
Leeâ€™s commitment to the Asian community and other minority groups transcends
on-screen work and takes him behind the scenes as well. He is currently developing scripts
targeting minorities in non-stereotypical roles for his own production company. With his
success on stage, television was Leeâ€™s next goal. Over the past decade, he has
guest-starred on dozens of television shows including ER , Ellen Again , Strong Medicine , Mad
About You , Walker Texas Ranger , Diagnosis Murder , Chicago Hope , Beverly Hills 90210 ,
Babylon 5 , Party of Five , Blind Justice , and Night Stalker , among others. Away from the
cameras, Lee is an athlete at heart. From competitive tennis player to avid hiker, he is a huge
sports and fitness fanatic. It is the fitness enthusiast in him that appreciates the same in a
co-star. "I can spot a good right hook when I see one," recalls Lee of Michelle
Rodriguezâ€™s punch that knocked him out in one of their scenes from The Fast and the
Furious . "That was definitely an excellent right hook."

Jocelyn EnrÃ­quez is a dance singer from San Francisco (born December 28 , 1974 ). She is of
Filipino descent: her parents are from the province of Pangasinan . She started with an all
girl group in high school the Pinay Divas, a reference to girl group En Vogue who were known as
the Funky Divas. Her debut album, Lovely was released in 1994 on Classified Records . In 1996 ,
she moved to Tommy Boy Records , where she released her debut single, "Do You Miss Me" in late
1996 and her second album, Jocelyn in early 1997 . Jocelyn peaked at #182 on the Billboard 200
albums chart and at #11 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Jocelyn Enriquez graduated
from Pinole Valley High School in 1993. "Do You Miss Me" became a top 40 hit at dance and pop radio
(#17 and #38 peaks, respectively), and peaked at #49 on the Hot 100 . The single was also
successful outside of the U.S. where it reached #7 in Singapore and was a top 20 hit in Canada.
Its follow up, " A Little Bit Of Ecstasy " was not quite as big a radio hit, failing to cross over to
the pop stations and peaking at #25 at dance radio. However, it had stronger sales than "Do You
Miss Me" (peaking at #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart, as opposed to #8),
which enabled it to reach #55 on the Hot 100. "A Little Bit Of Ecstasy" is remembered to this day,
due to its recent inclusion on the DDRMAX2 PlayStation 2 game. Pop punk band Lucky Boys
Confusion later covered "Do You Miss Me" on their 2001 album [ Throwing the Game ]. Since 1997,
Enriquez has had several club hits in America such as "Big Love", but has not received radio
support or gotten sales support from the mainstream public. However, she did score another
pop hit in 1999 , as part of a supergroup called Stars on 54 , which consisted of Enriquez, Dutch
Eurodance performer Amber , and house diva Ultra Nate ; the three women joined forces to cover
the disco tune "If You Could Read My Mind" for the movie Studio 54 . In 2000/1, She appeared on the
Cindy Margolis show performing her hit "When I Get Close To You" which topped the Hot Dance
Music/Club Play chart. In 2003, Enriquez released her third album, All My Life , and started
her own record label, JEM Entertainment. Two singles were released from the album: " No Way No
How " and " Why ". The albums lead single " No Way No How " became a surprise hit faring well on
Rhythmic/ Dance format radio and at Discoteques. It peaked at #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club
Play chart. She is credited as a guest vocalist on Thunderpuss 's track "So Fabulous So
Fierce," which also appears in the Dance Dance Revolution video game series. Also credited
with helping launch her career is the talented Glenn Gutierrez , a well known music producer
from the Bay Area who also produced for Stevie B in the early 1980s.

Lalaine

Lalaine Ann Vergara-Paras (born June 3 , 1987 in Burbank , California ), also known as Lalaine ,
is an American actress and singer . She is the youngest of 4 siblings, Marian, Francisco and
Cristina and has 2 nephews and a niece. Born to Filipino parents originally from Batangas and
Pampanga , where she sometimes travels to on vacations, she grew up and currently lives in Los
Angeles, California . Her name means 'wool' in French, but she has never stated how she got the
name. She is of Filipino, Chinese and Spanish descent. "People ask me, 'Are you Spanish?'
â€Š I say I have Spanish in me but I'm not just Spanish. I'm proud of my ethnicities...."
Lalaine has recently finished acting as the lead in the new movie Royal Kill which also stars
Academy Award nominees Eric Roberts and Pat Morita . Lalaine is normally credited by her first
name only. In French, her name translates, 'the wool.' She is commonly known for playing
"Miranda Isabella Sanchez" on Disney Channel 's highly-rated show Lizzie McGuire ,
alongside Hilary Duff . She reprised this role on the pilot of a spin-off series, What's Stevie
Thinking? , about Miranda's younger sister, but this did not air in 2005 as originally
expected and appears to be scrapped. Lalaine's road to stardom began when she was hanging out
with Nikki Alberto and she found a job at the Broadway production of Les Miserables . In it, she
played Young Cosette and Eponine. When Lalaine returned to California, she acted in several
television commercials, including some of those for Microsoft and Burger King . She also
participated in a theater play in her home state, called Brundibar . Lalaine's voice has been
used for many movies, including Inspector Gadget and Lolita . She also played orphan "Kate" in
the ABC -TV version of the movie Annie . She starred alongside AJ Trauth in the Disney Channel
original movie You Wish as "Abby." Lalaine also portrayed "Chloe," a young
Slayer-In-Training who commits suicide, on the hit TV-Series Buffy the Vampire Slayer . When
the First Evil assumes her form, Lalaine plays the malevolent force. In addition to her acting
career, Lalaine is involved in many charity events, such as the AIDS benefit concert and
*NSYNC 's challenge for the youth. In 2003, Lalaine released her independent album,
"Lalaine: Inside Story". Lalaine wrote six songs on the album herself, including "Life Is
Good", "Can't Stop", and "Save Myself". She has been working with Radio Disney , performing
her songs all over Southern California, and went to Hawaii with Disney's Imagineers. For six
months Lalaine's song "You Wish", written for the movie of the same name, was in the Top 30 Radio
Disney songs. She has signed a record deal with Warner Brother's Records. She also performed
on the last official episode of All That . Her most recent single was "I'm Not Your Girl", and the
video can be seen at either AOL Music or Yahoo! Launch . The lyrics of the song, and the video
itself, could be viewed as an attack on Hilary Duff's public image. In the video, Lalaine
portrays herself and two girls in blonde wigs (both looking similar to Duff's character on
Lizzie McGuire ), and the lyrics speak of how Lalaine is not "someone who's quiet and polite,
likes staying home on every Friday night." Duff had said in an interview with Blender magazine
in 2006 that she is a quiet girl who likes staying home on Friday nights, and did not feel badly
doing so while knowing that many other girls her age liked going out and partying. Royal Kill is
her most recent project in which she plays a lead role. The psychological thriller also stars
Academy Award nominees Pat Morita and Eric Roberts alongside professional wrestler Gail Kim
. Lalaine was writing her pop rock record with various writers including Glen Ballard , Oliver
Leiber, Danielle Brisebois and others. Now, Lalaine is reworking her record rhythmically
with super producer Jonathan "J.R." Rotem (50 Cent, Britney Spears, Rihanna), Outkast
producer Rico Wade and songwriter Evan "Kidd" Bogart (Rihanna, Ashley Tisdale), among
others. A few new song titles have surfaced the internet including: "Thin Air", "Pushing Me
Away", "Unwanted", "Doing Just Fine", "Til The End Of Time", "Tempted", "This Secret", "On
The Edge Of Goodbye", "Maybe", "Real Life", "No More", "More Than Words Can Say", "Hey Now",
"This Show Must Go On", "So Far So What", and "Isn't It Enough".So far only "Doing Just Fine",
"No More", "Real Life", and "Hey Now" have leaked to a Lalaine site and "More Than Words Can Say"
leaked to Limewire as well as "Haunted", "Did You Hear About Us", and "I'm Not Your Girl". In
2004 , Lalaine went to Philippines and made guestings in the GMA Network including the SOP
Gigsters . She began hosting her own Filipino travel show Flipside , where she travels around
the islands. She also promoted GMA Pinoy TV in San Francisco, California in 2005 . She has been
linked to her good friend, Raviv Ullman of Phil of the Future .
