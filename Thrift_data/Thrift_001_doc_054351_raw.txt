Rich Dad. Rich Kid?

Posted by Adrian in Rich on Mar 13th, 2009 | 10 responses

Let’s not mince words: by most measures The AJC Family is Rich!

But, does that mean that our children are rich? Does it mean that Mom and Pop will buy them cars,
vacations, etc.?

The inspiration for this post comes from a comment (on a post by Diane about her car), where
Debbie says:

I think most 16 year oldâ€™s get cars these days.

I had one before I turned 17, although I had to pay for it with my own money and get my own insurance
(but I think the trend is now parents buying their kids first vehicles and insurance from what
Iâ€™ve been seeing and in fact- I wrote a post about how teenagers are in the perfect
position to put aside some money during their high school years on Wisebread.com and do you
know the comments I got?!

Parents saying that the idea was ridiculous, kids shouldnâ€™t be expected to save the
money they earn on jobs nor would they do it if they understood the value of compound interest
and how much those first few thousands would be when they were ready to retire; if kids work
during the summer how will they take trips to Europe and attend soccer or music camp, etc. I am
still in shock!)

I must admit that I am in ‘shock’ as well …

… but, this brings me to an interesting point: how do ‘rich parents’ bring up their kids?

After all, when you all reach your Number , maybe you need some guidance as to how YOU should face
these same issues?

All I can tell you is what we do:

We are in one of the highest socio-economic levels, yet our children (11 and 14 years old)
already know that if they want cars, they will need to buy their own. We will contribute (prob.
up to 50%) … but, they will need to save up their portion and fund the running costs.

I’m guessing that most of you reading this blog had to do it the same way (?) … at least we had
to, so why shouldn’t they?

We feel that just because your parents are ‘rich’ doesn’t mean that YOU are … at least
these are the conversations that we have with our children

Image: http://7million7years.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif

Why?

We feel that the best FINANCIAL gifts that we can give our children are:

a) Teaching them to take sole responsibility for their own financial situation, and

b) Teaching them how to become rich on their own

… we hope, leading them to the type of confidence and independence that only
self-sufficiency can provide.

Think about the second one: what an advantage is it to have parents who have gone from $30k in
debt to $7million in the bank? It’s got to be better than reading a blog, or having an
occassional mentor … of course, the disadvantage is the child’s natural inclination to
rebel from their parents, so, we add a couple of extra advantages:

c) We pay for their formal education. 100% … no “if’s” and “but’s”, for any
course, in any reasonable location (we’re not sending them to Switzerland to go to
Finishing School!) as helps them achieve their academic goals … but, only their first
‘real’ degree. If they want to sacrifice current earning potential for future by earning
Masters, PHD’s, and/or MBA’s, that’s their financial trade-off to make, and

d) [AJC: This is the secret advantage that we do NOT tell them about up front ] They will never
starve … if all else fails, we are their Safety Net. But, they will not be able to “mooch off
the folks” … this is simply an ‘insurance policy’ against disaster.

To that, we add all the ‘normal’ non-financial parenting, PLUS the luxuries of private
schooling; after-school activities; bedrooms with private bathrooms, robes and studies
(equipped with MacBooks, of course!) for each; as well as the swimming pool, tennis court,
travel, etc. lifestyle that living in a ‘rich household’ provides …

What do you do (or plan on doing) with your children?

A little perspective …

Posted by Adrian in Rich on Jan 28th, 2009 | no responses



Image: http://7million7years.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/picture-1.png

For a bit of fun, I typed in an annual income of $220,000 into this handy little online
calculator , and it shows that I’m the 107,565th richest person in the world … whoohoo!

Now, if I typed in my real annual income, I think that I could jump myself higher up that list …
and, if I factored in that I get that money mainly passively, well ….

Reminds me of an interview that I saw with Guy LalibertÃ© , founder of Cirque Du Soleil, who
went from street performer (read homeless hustler) to sharing the same level of wealth as
Oprah.

Now, that’s not the bit that blew me away; what did was that they were sharing something like
160th place on Forbes’ list of the richest people in the world: Oprah … Cirque Du Soleil Man
… and, they ONLY get to be joint 160th (approx.) on the list??!!

Who are these other dudes between them and Bill Gates?!

So, it’s really good to be able to put things in perspective and realize that if you are
earning almost ANY regular salary, you are in the Top 10% of the richest people on the planet:

The Global Rich List calculations are based on figures from the World Bank Development
Research Group. To calculate the most accurate position for each individual we assume that
the world’s total population is 6 billionÂ¹ and the average worldwide annual income is
$5,000Â².

Below is the yearly income in percentage for different income groups according to the World
Bank’s figuresÂ³.



Image: http://www.globalrichlist.com/_images/blank.gif Percentage of world
population Percentage of world income Yearly individual income Daily individual income

Image: http://www.globalrichlist.com/_images/red.gif Bottom 10 percent 0.8 $400 $1,10
Bottom 20 percent 2.0 $500 $1,37 Bottom 50 percent 8.5 $850 $2,33 Bottom 75 percent 22.3 $1,487
$4,07 Bottom 85 percent 37.1 $2,182 $5,98

Image: http://www.globalrichlist.com/_images/red.gif Top 10 percent 50.8 $25,400
$69,59 Top 5 percent 33.7 $33,700 $92,33 Top 1 percent 9.5 $47,500 $130,14



Image: http://www.globalrichlist.com/_images/blank.gif

The world’s distribution of money can also be displayed as the chart below.

Â³ Milanovic, Branco. “True World Income Distribution, 1988 and 1993: First
calculations based on household surveys alone”, World Bank Development Research Group,
November 2000, page 30.

So, realize that UNLESS YOU ARE PLANNING TO DEVOTE SERIOUS SLABS OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY TO
WORTHY CAUSES this blog and everything we are doing here is about as useful as a blog on
whittling … and, probably a darn site less so, because there’s nothing inherently of
artistic merit in even the best-crafted bank account.

The perfect way to allocate your spending?

Posted by Adrian in Saving on Jan 7th, 2009 | 7 responses



Image:
http://7million7years.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/balancedmoneyformula.jpg

I saw this on Get Rich Slowly and wonder what you think of it?

Since I didn’t allocate my own spending this way ‘on the way up’, I can’t comment
either way … but, maybe some of you can?

Here’s how it works:

You take your After Tax income and divide it into three categories:

1. Needs – These are you ‘must haves’ i.e. things that you can’t go without:
rent/mortgage; car; electricity; basic food (the book provides a ‘rule of thumb’ for
this); and, so on.

You allocate 50% of your after tax income to these needs; given that we already have the 25%
Income Rule (spend no more than 25% of your after tax income on rent/mortgage) that leaves 25%
on all the other ‘needs’.

2. Wants – According to the book, you should have fun – and, budget 30% of your after-tax
income for it. I happen to be of the same mindset … what is money, if not for spending (except
that you must do it in a way that allows you to live your Life’s Purpose by your desired
Date).Â 

According to the book, ‘wants’ include additional food (i.e. lamb chops instead of dog
food?), your cable TV and internet (these are definite needs for me, especially on my 100″
home theater screenÂ … but, I can afford it!); trips and vacations; and, so on.

3. Savings – that leaves (or should leave) 20% of your after-tax income for your 401k
investments and other savings/investment … since this is 5% to 10% more than most authors
suggest, I commend it. Just remember, that even with 20% you’re not going to be able to save
your way to wealth.

All in all, it seems like a pretty good savings plan to me … what improvements would you make?

Special Announcement!

I have been working on a project … call it a labor of love (when you find out what it is, you’ll
decide that if this is my idea of ‘love’, I need psychiatric treatment) … and, I want you
to participate!

Let me take you back to where this project had it’s genesis:

In 1998, I was struggling financially and directionally … I had my two break-even
businesses, a lovely wife and two babies, but no money and no major prospects: it would take a
miracle to get the businesses above break-even.

Then I came across the concept of the Number.

A simple idea: your Number is the amount of money that you need to have set aside (by whatever
Date you happen to decide upon) so that you can be financially free to [ insert goal of choice:
retire; play golf professionally; write a book; volunteer abroad; move into the
old-people's home or Florida, which pretty much amounts to the same thing; etc. ].

At the same time, I found my Life’s Purpose: to be constantly traveling mentally,
physically, and spiritually …

… which means nothing to you, but meant everything to me (which is all that counts, right?).

Understanding my ‘life after work’ dream (in my case, it meant discovering my Life’s
Purpose) told me that I needed $5 Million within 5 years. A major wake-up call considering
that, at the time, I was $30,000 in debt!

If you’ve read my $7 Million Dollar Journey you will know that, because I found my Number , I
made it.

I decided that I had to give back, by helping others to understand, find, and achieve their
Numbers, as well …

… so, to help you figure out your own Number (and, Life’s Purpose … if you so desire) I have
created a new web-site .

I have also created a unique home for you on the Internet , a place where you can Share Your Number
with like-minded people … hopefully, you will connect with others who can help you on your
way, and you may even be instrumental in helping them!

Take a look at these sites, then join up and Share Your Number … it’s easy, fun, and could be
very, very rewarding for those who actively participate.

As readers of this blog, and ‘charter members’, your membership will always be free. And,
tell your friends, they can be charter members, too

Image: http://7million7years.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif

The only ‘catch’ is that I have not officially launched this site, yet, so you will be the
‘beta testers’ … try it out and let me know what you think using the form, below (just type
then ‘submit’): [contact-form-7 404 "Not Found"]

Passion before money …

Posted by Adrian in The Number on Oct 7th, 2008 | no responses



Image: http://7m7y.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/moneykey.jpg?w=103



I’m about to find out if you can make money online : click here to read the latest installment
in my new online money-making adventure!

____________________________________

I talk a lot on this site (and, on http://7m7y.com ) about money being there to serve your Life
…

… yet, we slave our lives away to the pursuit of money. Go figure!

So, when working out your Number – that ‘magic number’ that tells you if/when/how you
will retire – it is my contention that you first need to start by understanding your Life’s
Purpose.

It’s nice to see that somebody on the finance community agrees with me: George Kinder ,
author of The Seven Stages of Money Maturity !

In fact, George is a financial planner who is one of the early pioneers / practitioners of a form
of financial planning called ‘ Life Planning’ … where your financial plan is designed
to support the life you want, not necessarily the life that you have.

I have provided some exercises to help you understand your Life’s Purpose, hence your
Number; similarly, George Kinder poses three questions that he considers important in
achieving a similar result (you may have seen these on Oprah):

1. “Assume you’ve got all the money you need – enough for the rest of your life. Maybe
you’re not as rich as Warren Buffet, but you never have to worry about money for any reason.
The question is, what would you do with it? How would you live? Feel free to let your imagination
roam. What would you do with it all? Think for a moment, then write down the answer … ”

2. “You go to the doctor. The doctor discovers you have a rare illness. He says you’re going
to feel perfectly fine for the rest of your life. But, he says the illness will prove fatal. The
sorry outcome will occur sometime within five and ten years. It will be sudden. The question
is, now that you know that your life will be over in five years, how would you live it? What would
you do?”

3. “This question will sound a bit like the previous question, but it’s different: It
starts the same way. You go to the doctor. You’re feeling perfectly healthy. And again the
doctor says you have a serious illness. But then the doctor says, ‘You only have 24 hours to
live.’ So, what did you miss ? Who did you not get to be? What did you not get to do?”

Of all these questions, obviously the last is the key … and it is the purpose of the Rear Deck
Speech – designed to make you think past ‘things’ and to the more deep/meaningful
aspects of your ideal life .

These questions, however, will help you if you’ve been struggling with the Finding Your
Life’s Purpose exercises that I provided …

Your Number

Posted by Adrian in The Number on Oct 3rd, 2008 | 6 responses

Nowadays, somebody only need to write “The” and “Number” next to each other and we
automatically know what it means: the amount that you need in your nest-egg so that you can
finally throw off those corporate shackles and ‘retire’ …

… well, do anything other than ‘work’ for your daily crust.

The only problem is that nobody tells you how to find The Number!

I should know, I read books on the subject and they all focus on rubbish like: “multiply 75% of
your pre-retirement’ salary by 13″.

Which has some obvious problems:

1. How do I know what my pre-retirement salary will be?

2. What if I spend more/less in retirement than when I was working?

3. How will I know my money will last?

The reality is that – for most people – there is (and should be) a total disconnect between
how you make your fortune and how you spend it!

In other words, just because you earn $x before you retire, it doesn’t mean that you will
spend 75% of $x to 125% of $x (as most financial authors assume) in retirement.

So, I came with my own method – and, it worked for me!

Here’s how:

1. Complete a simple spreadsheet of your major (non-investment) personal purchases,
income, and living expenses now and over the next 1, 5, 10, and 20 years. Don’t forget to apply
the Inflation Adjustment Factors!

2. To help I have listed the typical expenditures of a $100,000 a year lifestyle, a $250,000 a
year lifestyle, and a $550,000 a year lifestyle. These should provide some reference points
to calculate your own future living expenses.

3. Use the spreadsheet to calculate Your Number and Your Date.

That’s it!

… and, I’m betting that it won’t even resemble your expected final salary – in fact,
I’m betting that the number is so damn big’n'scary that you won’t even get there just on
any typical salary – even with your 401k maxed

Why bother? Ric Edelman says that you already have it all …

Posted by Adrian in The Number on Aug 11th, 2008 | no responses

I while ago I wrote a post gauging my own performance against the “Ric Edelman Secrets” …

I’ll leave you to go back and read the post and its comments as I think that they serve to show
some of the differences between financial advice for the masses and the types of things that
people who want extraordinary levels of wealth (if you’re reading this, that’s probably
you!) need to consider.

In case you haven’t yet come across him or his books, Ric Edelman runs one of the country’s
largest independent Financial Planning firms, so his firm has interviewed thousands of
people looking for financial advice.

Ric says that when he (or one of his staff) asks the question of a new client “what are your
financial goals?” the most common answers – by far – in this descending order of
importance, are:

1. To buy a house

2. To save for (their kids’) college

3. To save for retirement

Now, here’s where I agree totally with Ric: these are not financial goals … they are
inevitable outcomes!

Loosely paraphrasing Ric, here’s why:

1. Your house – you probably already have a house (most people do), and if you don’t, you
won’t have to be prodded very much to go out and buy one – look at the sub-prime crisis to see
how easy it can be to buy a house!

2. Your childrens’ college – if your children want to go to college, they will … one way or
another, they will come up with the money. Sure you can improve on the situation by providing
the funds to help them get into the college of their choice, but it’s a qualitative goal, not a
‘make or break’ in most cases.

3. Your retirement – you will retire … one day! Maybe not at the time, and in the manner that
you would like to – but, you will retire (or die trying). It’s as simple as that!

So, why bother doing any financial planning when you already have – or will have – it all?!

Simple: it’s because these people haven’t yet developed a sense of their Life’s
Purpose … to me that is the only goal worth aiming for … but, we have already discussed that
subject , at length.

The lament of the middle-class millionaire ….

Posted by Adrian in The Number on Jul 27th, 2008 | no responses

I must confess that I understand EXACTLY what this ‘poor woman’ is saying …

http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=768292103

Ryan (who is one of the Final 15 in my 7 Millionaires … In Training! ‘grand experiment’)
sent the link to me saying:

About 6 months ago I did a similar exercise to determine how much I would need to
â€œretireâ€� and live the kind of life I wanted to (travel, philanthropy, golf,
bigger house,activities, etc.). Although it seemed like a stretch to even write down, I
settled on $10 million in 10 years. After watching a show on cnbc, in particular this clip,
http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=768292103 , I think itâ€™s time to revise my
estimate!!! And to think that a couple of years ago I thought if you had a million dollars you
could do anything you wanted.

The exercise that Ryan is referring to is the culmination of a series of posts on
http://7m7y.com designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to help you find your Number.

This video – I believe – helps explain why I think that your Number should be couched in
terms of required living expenses rather than some nebulous lump sum (such as $1 million; $5
million; $10 million; etc.) … although I also show you how to calculate the ‘lump sum’
that you will need.

But, Ryan doesn’t need more than $10 Million (a.k.a. $500,000 per year … indexed for
inflation) to live a life that simply involves “travel, philanthropy, golf, bigger
house,activities, etc.”; he just needs to realize that on $500k per year:

1. He will not be able to afford ownership (fractional or full) of multiple houses, jets,
yachts and the like (although one used Ferrari isn’t out of the question), and

2. He will NOT be rich … rather ‘comfortably off’ – at least, according to Felix Dennis
the rather quirky (and exceedingly rich) British/American magazine publisher.

… it’s a tough life

Posted by Adrian in The Number on Jun 24th, 2008 | no responses If you’ve been sticking around
to see how the 7 Millionaire … In Training! ‘grand experiment’ can pay off your you …
Â  … your patience is about to be rewarded – at least, that is my sincere hope. Â 
Starting today are a series of special weekly posts at http://7m7y.com designed to help you
find your Number.Â  Â  This is perhaps the most important financial exercise that you
will ever undertake in your enitre life … at least, it was for me! Whether youÂ intend to be

weeks, and follow along with the simple – but critically important – exercises that I will
be providing. Like everything here, this information is provided free, without any catches,
for your benefit. Make good use of the opportunity … it won’t come around again. Â  Good
Luck and I hope that it is as profound an exercise for you as it was for me ! AJC.Â 
_________________________________________

Sometimes you can’t see further than the back of your own hand until somebody points the way
…

… then it just seems so damn obvious that you wonder why all of those other dopes out there are
still staring at the backs of their hands!

I was preparing for a radio interview the other day and I happened to pull up an old e-mail (that I
mentioned in a previous post ) from Fidelity – a fine investment management company – that
proudly proclaimed:

Did you know that weekly contributions of $34 could potentially grow to over $76,000 in 20
years?

At the time, I just wrote my little counter-piece and laughed it off because that $76,000
probablyÂ won’t even buy you a car in 20 years time!

But in thinking about it – and, this is what I said on air – it’s actually much worse than
that …

You go without lunch every day for the next 20 years, and you don’t even get a new car?!

How the hell are you ever going to retire!

Think about it, if $34 a week gets you $76,000 in 20 years … then, you would need to save $340 a
week for the next 20 years just to get $760,000 !

Now, even if you could figure a way to save $340 a week (starting right now!) $760,000 a year in 20
years is NOT the same as havingÂ $760,000 today …

$760,000 today will get you a reasonably ‘safe’ income of $30,000 a year (indexed for
inflation) if you invest the capital wisely, if you don’t suffer any major losses, and if you
don’t spend any of it up-front or along the way.

In other words, the equivalent of $30,000 a year has to buy you everything you need and want for
the rest of your life !

But …

That’s only if you have the $760,000 today !

If you’re like the rest of the world, to get there you’ll need to put aside that $340 a week
for the next 20 years, butÂ  that little pup called inflation will be nipping at your heels
the whole way …

… and, that $760,000 in 20 years will only be ‘worth’ $350,000 if inflation is just 4%. I
can’t even begin to think about what would happen if inflation rises to 5%+, as predicted.

That means that you get to live onÂ $14,000Â (in today’s dollars) a year!

So, how much did you expect to save?

By when?

But, wait, Fidelity is offering aÂ 7% annualized return … aren’t you going to invest
that money in the stock market (an ultra-low-cost IndexÂ Fund, of course) that averages
13% a year?

Sure.

Because the day that YOU invest the market is going to crash, WWIII is going to break out, the
sub-prime crisis will just be getting into full swing (again … will they never learn?), or
worse.

YOU, my friend, will need to plan for numbers that you can rely on because you only get one shot at
this …

…Â and, the moneyÂ  has to last you for the rest of your life Â  – unless your backup
plan is (a) still checking out groceries at the local supermarket when you’re 75, (b) eating
dog food, or (c) let me hear it [ leave a comment ].

And, the number that you can rely onÂ is this : 8%

Because, you can put your money in an ultra-low-cost Index Fund (we’ll forget about
minimums and entry/exit fees for now) and rely on the fact that the market has never had a 30 year
period where the returns have been less than 8% (that includes periods of war and pestilence
and pure market stupidity).

… but, now you have to wait 30 years; because if you only wait 20 years, you can only be sure of
getting a 4% annualized return, and that just sucks.

The good news is that if you can wait 30 years so that you can get a ‘guaranteed’ 8% return and
you can keep socking that $340 away, week in week out for 30 years , well that’s over $200,000 a
year (at a 4% ‘safe’ withdrawal rate)!

Unfortunately, we still have that little pup (a.k.a. inflation) dragging at
usÂ viaÂ his leash, whichÂ meansÂ that you can really only comfortably rely on an
annual income of $25,000 in today’s dollars.

But …

You will do (much) better if you can start socking away, without fail , $340 a week and indexing
that with inflation as well (in 15 years you’ll be putting away $588 a week and in 30 years
$1,060 a week ).

In fact, if you can maintain that regimen for 30 years, you’ll deserve a medal as well as your
annual income of $37,000 in today’s dollars!

$14,000 … $25,000 … or even $37,000 a year in 30 years: is that really what you had in mind?

I suspect not, or you wouldn’t be reading this blog

Who wants to retire in their 20's, anyway?

Results Show: Final 30Â announced live tomorrow (!)

________________________

Yesterday we talked about starting young, not just as it applies to saving, but as it applies to
accelerating your retirement plan.

Maybe you couldn’t find your WHY?

After all, who wants to think about retirement when they are still in their 20′s or even
30′s? Most are still thinking about their job!

Yet, as yesterday’s post showed, there are some good reasons for starting early. And, who
wouldn’t want to retire early if their goals matched these from a recent survey of
GenXfinance ‘s readers:



Image: http://7million7years.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/r11.jpg Â 

Being a ‘Gen X’ PF site, we can probably assume that most of the respondents were younger
than, say, me. But, it’s even more interesting to notice how each of the first three
categories (where the majority of the votes fell) require MONEY and/or TIME:

1. Extensive Travel

Think about it, you can escape money to a greater of lesser degree if you are willing to travel
frugally, work at least during some of your stopovers (haven’t you noticed how all the
‘servers’ in restaurants inÂ vacations areasÂ are young foreigners?) …

… but, you can’t escape the time element: this means that you have to be ‘retired’ from
your day job.

2. Not going to work; just taking things one day at a time

Obviously, this means that you are retired from your day job … but, two things happen when
this occurs:

i) Your income goes DOWN

ii) Your spending goes UP

For those who subscribe to the “75% of current income in retirement” theory, I ask this:
have you ever tried spending time doing anything BESIDES WORKING that doesn’t COST money?

Think about it … it stopped me from cashing out when I was offered $4 mill. a few years before I
eventually did cash out (for a helluva lot more!).

3. Doing volunteer or charity work

All [charity] work and no play makes Jack a dull boy … this is really 2. plus you are spending
some of your time (perhaps a lot) giving back. This is a good thing … as well as the great work
you are doing, you are spending less time … well … spending!

4. Other

If you scroll down the comments attached to GenXfinance’s post, you will see thatÂ most
of the ‘other’-folk either mean not retiring at all (like the ‘pursuing a second
career’ option) or involve a similar outflow of moneyÂ and/or a similar
savings-account-draining, non-income-earning amount of time.

But, they are all things that you will probably want to start whilst still young enough to enjoy
them …

… which means starting to build a pretty damn large nest-egg pretty damn soon!

Let me know what (and how much by when)Â ’retirement’ means to you? Add to: | blinklist |
