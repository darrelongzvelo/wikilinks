Jack Majorâ€™s wise counsel too sensible to be adopted in neo-conned Alberta

Alison Redford contemplates Justice Jack Majorâ€™s recommendations on MLA
compensation. Actual Alberta politicians may not be exactly as illustrated. Below: Justice
Jack Major.

Former Supreme Court Justice Jack Majorâ€™s long-awaited report on Alberta MLA
compensation doesnâ€™t stand much chance of doing anything more than serving as a
327-page doorstop in some dusty Legislature office, which is a pity because it actually makes
quite a lot of sense.

Not so long ago, when her Progressive Conservative Party was embroiled in a

difficult election campaign, Premier Alison Redford indicated she would accept Justice
Major â€™s recommendations holus-bolus, whatever they were. Now she is not so sure.

It is said here the problem is not that Justice Majorâ€™s report, released yesterday ,
recommends a much bigger salary for the premier, which would give the Wildrose
â€œOppositionâ€� something to hoot about for a couple of weeks but probably
wouldnâ€™t offend the average voter all that much.

Martha and Henry, as Ralph Klein used to call the typical voters he successfully courted, get
it that a premier has an important job. Moreover, theyâ€™ve been so propagandized by the
pro-business dogma of our era that big shots deserve much bigger salaries than the rest of us
theyâ€™d barely shrug at a $300,000 salary for the premier.

That part is baloney, of course. Good people will do great work for their province or country
for very modest salaries out of a sense of public service. But it is one of the myths of our time
that has been shouted from the rooftops by the very people who will nevertheless be quick to
attack this report.

Indeed, if thereâ€™s a surprise here, it ought not to be that Justice Major thinks the
premier deserves as big a salary as a deputy minister, but that we have been sold on the idea that
itâ€™s appropriate to pay deputy ministers that much. Presumably this is because
weâ€™ve bought the line that since this is the sort of money big bosses would get in
â€œthe private sectorâ€� itâ€™s the only way to get â€œthe best
peopleâ€� for the job â€“ a proposition that is pure horse pucky.

But Justice Major was right to suggest a salary of about $160,000 for backbench MLAs, and
$241,000 for cabinet ministers â€“ pay that is not outlandish when you remember their
responsibilities, the fact these sums include benefits and the reality that, like sports
stars, Canadian Parliamentarians tend to have short, high-risk careers.

Justice Major hit the mark when he wrote: â€œCompensation for MLAs should be generous
enough to attract suitably talented and capable individuals from all sectors , yet not so
generous as to be the primary motivator for prospective members.â€� (Emphasis added.)

Moreover, notwithstanding the objections of NDP Leader Brian Mason, he was right â€“
and probably not terribly controversial â€“ to propose that the tax-free portion of an
MLAâ€™s salary be retained for the simple reason it avoids Alberta taxpayers passing
this money pointlessly through to federal coffers, where itâ€™s only going to be used to
buy F-35s and shred valuable public records.

No, the real trouble with Justice Majorâ€™s report that will have all the usual suspects
in hysterics is his perfectly reasonable conclusion Members of the Legislative Assembly
deserve a defined benefit pension for their service to the public.

The neo-Con right in Canada and elsewhere in the West has been bitterly attacking decent
pensions for working people for decades for many reasons. Obviously, they are an impediment
to the far-rightâ€™s untiring efforts to undermine the middle class and increase the
disparity in wealth between the uber-rich and the rest of us.

Moreover, well-run defined benefit pension plans, in which the plan member is assured of a
regular monthly benefit upon retirement, are so efficient and deliver such good returns per
dollar invested that they deprive the private-sector â€œfinancial servicesâ€�
industry of the opportunity to fleece retirees of their hard-earned savings for the benefit
of bank executives and other members of the 1 per cent. In this case, they would save taxpayers
money too.

So, sure enough, it wasnâ€™t more than a couple of hours before the Edmonton Journal had
published a story on Justice Majorâ€™s recommendation quoting the always energetic
Scott Hennig of the so-called Canadian Taxpayers Federation, an Astroturf organization
created to work against the interests of ordinary taxpayers, assailing the report as
â€œcompletely out of line with public expectations.â€�

Sadly, this part is probably true, given the effective work done over the past 30 years or so by
these mysteriously funded corporate propaganda outfits that purport to represent ordinary
citizens.

â€œThey are recommending a defined-benefit, gold-plated pension plan, the same kind of
pension plan that Ralph Klein got rid of at Albertansâ€™ demand back in 1993,â€�
Mr. Hennig hyperventilated in the kind of comment we can expect to see a lot more of in the days
ahead. It is far from clear, of course, either that what the Justice is recommending is
â€œgold plated,â€� or that Alberta taxpayers demanded any such thing when Mr.
Klein was premier.

Presumably we can expect the foreign-financed Fraser Institute, which is also supported by
taxpayers through its undeserved charitable status, to weigh in at any moment with a
methodologically dubious report â€œprovingâ€� MLA pensions are a bad idea.

No, the only reasons these bad actors think defined benefit pensions for MLAs are a bad idea is
that they allow ordinary people with common sense attitudes to aspire to a life in public
service, and they set a bad example for other working people who might get the uppity idea they
deserve a decent retirement without having to pay private taxes for the privilege to the
banking industry.

Because people like our premier listen to the likes of the Fraser Institute and the CTF
â€“ or, at least, are sensibly concerned by those groupsâ€™ formidable and
well-financed propaganda machines â€“ Jack Majorâ€™s recommendations are
unlikely to amount to much.

This is a pity.

    -Why is it pure horse pucky? Please elaborate your conclusion. I agree it may not be the
    only way to attract but it is probably part of the picture. Same argument for judges,
    teachers, city counciloors, etc.

    p.s., good article. Thanks. Reply

    With the defined benefit Legislative Pension, individual MLAs were much less
    financially dependent on their Party and in consequence, after securing their six
    years, more representative of both their constituents and the greater public good.

    A big part of the reason Klein did away with the MLA pension program was so he could exert
    more control over his MLAs when they became restive over his neo-con policies. Witness
    the fate of the poor PC MLA from Leduc Wetaskiwin who opposed electrical deregulation.
    The Party promptly made sure he was not re-nominated and he was out on the street with
    essentially no benefits. Reply

    I think this is a great topic to debate. Myself, I go with lower/average salaries and
    "average" benefit/retirement packages.

    There's nothing wrong with making a good living, but, to be honest, if you manage your
    money correctly, you can afford a sports car, a cabin, a good sized home and two yearly
    vacations on $100 000. And this would be without too much to no debt if you manage and invest
    wisely.

    There are also many perks (expnse accounts and travel) that comes with the job, so it's not
    like the pay is all they receive.

    If that's not enough pay to have the privilege of bettering your country, it is my opinion
    that the politician's heart is not in the right place.

    Nelson Mandela comes to mind… Reply
