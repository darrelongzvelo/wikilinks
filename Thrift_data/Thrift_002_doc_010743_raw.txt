Kamikaze Faith: An Extremist Religion

Kamikaze Faith or Suicidal Faith is an extremmist religion.





Kamikaze

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Navy_Kamikaze_Lieutenant.jpg
A kamikaze pilot getting his last orders . Kamikaze ( Japanese : ç¥žé¢š; literally : "
god -wind" ; usual translation : " divine wind" ) is a word of Japanese origin. It comes from the
name the Japanese gave to a typhoon that destroyed the Mongol ships in the 13th century and
saved the country from invasion . In Western culture , the word kamikaze is used to mean the
suicide pilots of the Empire of Japan , and their attacks on the ships of the Allied Powers in the
final years of World War II , during which they flew their planes into enemy ships. It has also
come to mean other kinds of suicide attack. Most people in Western culture believe the word
kamikaze was the name used by the Japanese military for pilots , but that is not true. Their
correct name was tokubetsu kÅ�geki tai (ç‰¹åˆ¥æ”»æ’ƒéšŠ), which
literally means "special attack unit." This is usually abbreviated tokkÅ�tai
(ç‰¹æ”»éšŠ) in a shortened form. The suicide attacks made by Navy pilots were
called shinpÅ« tokubetsu kÅ�geki tai
(ç¥žé¢šç‰¹åˆ¥æ”»æ’ƒéšŠ, "divine wind special attack units" ).
The American translators used a different style of pronunciation of the Japanese language by
mistake, and read the word shinpÅ« ( "divine wind" ) as kamikaze . The name became popular
throughout the world, and after the war, the Japanese also started using it.

USS Bunker Hill was hit by Ogawa (see picture left) and another kamikaze near KyÅ«shÅ« on
May 11, 1945. Out of a crew of 2,600, 372 sailors were killed. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on
December 7, 1941, the Japanese Navy and Air force were defeated in several important battles,
like Midway and the Philippine Sea . They lost many ships (including nearly all the Japanese
aircraft carriers ), hundreds of fighter aircraft , and many of their best pilots. The
Japanese industry had little resources and was very poor compared to the American industry.
For this reason, the United States replaced their lost ships and planes with better ones very
quickly; but Japan could only make few, and of poor quality. During 1943-44, the Allied forces
were moving towards Japan. At the Battle of the Philippine Sea , on June 19-20, 1944, the
Japanese forces were pushed back to the Philippines . On July 15, Saipan (in the Northern
Mariana Islands ) was captured by Allied forces. The capture of Saipan made it possible for the
US Air force to attack Japan itself, using B-29 Superfortress bombers . After the fall of
Saipan, the Japanese commanders knew that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines
next. The Philippines were very important because they were located between the oil fields of
Southeast Asia and Japan. If Japan lost control over the Philippines, they would have little
fuel left for their ships. On October 17, the Allies started the attack on the Philippines in
the Battle of Leyte Gulf . Vice Admiral Takijiro Onishi was in charge of the Japanese Air Force
in Manila . He understood that it was impossible to win the battle with so few aircraft and
trained pilots. For this reason, he decided to form a suicide attack force, the Special Attack
Unit. A group of 24 student pilots volunteered for the mission. The Special Attack force was
organized into 4 groups, Unit Shikishima , Unit Yamato , Unit Asahi , and Unit Yamazakura .
These names were taken from a patriotic poem ( waka or tanka ), written by the Japanese
classical poet, Motoori Norinaga : " Shikishima no Yamato-gokoro wo hito towaba, asahi ni
niou yamazakura bana " (æ•·å³¶ã�® å€§å’Œå¿ƒã‚’
äººå•�ã�¯ã�° æœ�æ—¥ã�«åŒ‚ã�µ
å±±æ¡œèŠ±). The poem reads:

If someone asks about the Yamato spirit (Spirit of Old/True Japan) of Shikishima (a poetic
name for Japan) - it is the flowers of yamazakura (mountain cherry blossom ) that are fragrant
in the Asahi (rising sun). [1]

(A less literal translation could be read as: If someone asks about the spirit of Japan, it is
the flowers of mountain cherry blossoms that are fragrant in the rising sun. )

The kamikaze hits Columbia , killing 13 sailors and injuring 44. The Japanese were defeated at
the battle of Leyte Gulf, but the Special Attack force had great success. The first kamikaze
attack took place on October 21, 1944, against the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy , HMAS
Australia . [2] 30 sailors died in the attack, including its Captain Emile Dechaineux, and
many more were wounded. By October 26, 47 more Allied ships had been attacked. Most of them were
badly damaged or sunk, like the United States aircraft carrier USS St. Lo . [3] This early
success convinced the Japanese commanders to continue the kamikaze attacks. Many more
pilots were recruited to act as kamikaze . Over the next few months, more than 2,000 planes made
such attacks. When the Japanese stock of airplanes began to run low, new models of low quality
were built for these missions. Some of them, like the Nakajima Ki-115 Tsurugi , were made
mostly of wood and used stocks of older engines . The plane's landing gear was usually dropped
by the pilot after takeoff so it could be used by other aircraft, because he would not be landing
again. Similar suicide attack programs were planned, including rocket bombs with pilots
(called Ohka ) and submarine torpedoes ( Kaiten ). The high point of kamikaze attacks came from
April 6 to May 25, 1945 during the Battle of Okinawa , in Operation Kikusui ( "floating
chrysanthemums " ). In that time, seven important waves of attacks took place, with more than
1,500 kamikaze planes. Because their training had been too short and their airplanes were
poorly made, kamikaze pilots were easy targets for the experienced Allied pilots, who also
had much better planes. But still, the kamikaze who escaped the anti-aircraft fire and the
enemy fighter airplanes did great damage to the Allied fleet. The Allies won the battle, but
they lost many ships and men because of kamikaze attacks. By the end of the battle, at least 21
American ships had been sunk by kamikazes . Some ships from other Allied navies were also sunk,
and dozens more were damaged. [4] Hundreds of extra kamikaze planes were ready to defend Japan
from invasion. However, with Japan's surrender on August 15 after the atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the declaration of war by the Soviet Union , they were never used.

[ change ] Effects

The most important effect of the attacks was creating fear among the Allied troops. When the
American ships went to the last battles, the crews were very afraid of kamikaze pilots. By the
end of World War II, the Japanese Navy had sacrificed 2,525 kamikaze pilots, and the Air force
had lost 1,387. The Japanese government said, the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195. They
also claimed that the kamikaze attacks were the cause of 80% of Allied deaths in the last years
of the War. The American sources claim that kamikaze sunk less ships than the Japanese say. But
still, they agree that they did very important damage. According to a U.S. Air Force source,
the kamikaze attackers sunk 34 Navy ships, damaged 368 others, killed 4,900 sailors, and
wounded over 4,800. [5] In a 2010 book, the historian Robin Rielly said that about 60 U.S. ships
were sunk by kamikazes, and over 400 were damaged by them. [6]

    High school girls say farewell to Kamikaze pilots with cherry blossom branches at the
    Battle of Okinawa , on April 12, 1945. Many kamikaze pilots offered themselves as
    volunteers for the mission. They were usually very young, between 18 and 24 years old.
    Their belief was that dying when striking the enemies of Japan and the Emperor down was a
    very honorable death. This principle was traditional since the days of the samurai , and
    gave great importance to the sense of duty and obedience . This idea was called Giri (
    "Obligation" ), and was part of the code of conduct of the Japanese warriors since the
    Middle Ages, the Bushido . Many young men sacrificed themselves by their free will
    because these beliefs and their love for the home land were the most important things for
    them. The tokkÅ�tai pilot's manual told pilots to never close their eyes. This was
    because if a pilot closed his eyes he would miss his target. In the final moments before the
    crash, the pilot was to shout "Hissatsu!" ( "Critical Strike!" ) as loud as he could. [7]
    [8] However, many others did so because of social pressure . Not offering oneself as a
    volunteer was a sign of cowardice and dishonor . Several professional pilots who were
    ordered to do suicide attacks did it because of military obedience, not because of honor.
    One of the first kamikaze pilots, Lieutenant Yukio Seki, wrote after nearly being forced
    to volunteer:

        Japan's future is pale if it is forced to kill one of its best pilots. I am not going on
        this mission for the Emperor or for the Empire... I am going because I was ordered to.
        [9]

    

A special ceremony before going to combat usually took place. Pilots drank sake and ate a ball
of rice . They were given medals , and a katana sword . They put on a headband with the rising sun,
and a sennibari , a "belt of a thousand stitches " made by a thousand women, who made one stitch
each. [10] Many times, they took prayers written by their families with them. [11] According
to legend , young pilots on kamikaze missions many times flew southwest from Japan over the 922
metre (~3000 ft) Mount Kaimon. Suicide mission pilots looked over their shoulders to see
this, and said farewell to their country. Another legend says that kamikaze pilots dropped
flowers from the air, as they departed on their final missions. Some places, like the hills
near Kikajima airport , are said to have beds of cornflower that bloom in early May from those
days. [12]

Some important military men who survived the war criticized the kamikaze plan years after.
Saburo Sakai , a war time ace pilot said:

    

        A kamikaze is a surprise attack, according to our ancient war tactics . Surprise
        attacks will be successful the first time, maybe two or three times. But what fool
        would continue the same attacks for ten months? Emperor Hirohito must have realized
        it. He should have said "Stop."

"Divine wind") [kamikaꜜze] (

listen ) , official name: Tokubetsu KÅ�gekitai ( ç‰¹åˆ¥æ”»æ’ƒéšŠ ? )
, TokkÅ� Tai ( ç‰¹æ”»éšŠ ? ) , or TokkÅ� ( ç‰¹æ”» ? ) , were suicide
attacks by military aviators from the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the
closing stages of the Pacific campaign of World War II , designed to destroy warships more
effectively than was possible with conventional attacks. Numbers quoted vary, but at least
47 Allied vessels, from PT boats to escort carriers, were sunk by kamikaze attacks, and about
300 damaged. About 14% of kamikaze attacks managed to hit a ship.

Kamikaze aircraft were essentially pilot-guided explosive missiles, purpose-built or
converted from conventional aircraft, without the ability to deliver torpedoes or bombs or
attack other aircraft, or even to land. Pilots would attempt to crash their aircraft into
enemy ships in what was called a "Body Attack" (äœ“åœ“ã�Ÿã‚Š;
äœ“åœ“ã‚Š, taiatari ) in planes laden with some combination of explosives ,
bombs , torpedoes and full fuel tanks ; accuracy was much better than a conventional attack,
and the payload larger. A kamikaze could sustain damage which would disable a conventional
attacker and still achieve its objective. The goal of crippling or destroying large numbers
of Allied ships, particularly aircraft carriers, was considered to justify sacrificing
pilots and aircraft.

These attacks, which began in October 1944, followed several critical military defeats for
the Japanese. They had long lost aerial dominance due to outdated aircraft and the loss of
experienced pilots. On a macroeconomic scale, Japan experienced a decreasing capacity to
wage war, and a rapidly declining industrial capacity relative to the United States. The
Japanese government expressed its reluctance to surrender. In combination, these factors
led to the use of kamikaze tactics as Allied forces advanced towards the Japanese home islands
.

USS Bunker Hill was hit by kamikazes piloted by Ensign Kiyoshi Ogawa (photo above) and another
airman on 11 May 1945. 389 personnel were killed or missing from a crew of 2,600. [ 1 ] While the
term "kamikaze" usually refers to the aerial strikes, the term has sometimes been applied to
various other intentional suicide attacks. The Japanese military also used or made plans for
Japanese Special Attack Units , including those involving submarines , human torpedoes ,
speedboats and divers . Nazi Germany formed its own group of suicide aircraft pilots called
the Leonidas Squadron , but the German commanders were more reluctant to use them.

The tradition of death instead of defeat, capture, and perceived shame was deeply entrenched
in Japanese military culture. It was one of the primary traditions in the samurai life and the
Bushido code: loyalty and honour until death.

The Mongol fleet destroyed in a typhoon. Ink and water on paper, by Kikuchi YÅ�sai , 1847 The
Japanese word Kamikaze is usually translated as "divine wind" ( kami is the word for "god",
"spirit", or "divinity", and kaze for "wind"). The word kamikaze originated as the name of
major typhoons in 1274 and 1281, which dispersed Mongolian invasion fleets under Kublai Khan
.

In Japanese, the formal term used for units carrying out suicide attacks during 1944–45 is
tokubetsu kÅ�geki tai (ç‰¹åˆ¥æ”»æ’ƒéšŠ), which literally means
"special attack unit". This is usually abbreviated to tokkÅ�tai
(ç‰¹æ”»éšŠ). More specifically, air suicide attack units from the Imperial
Japanese Navy were officially called shinpÅ« tokubetsu kÅ�geki tai
(ç¥žé¢šç‰¹åˆ¥æ”»æ’ƒéšŠ, "divine wind special attack units").
ShinpÅ« is the on-reading ( on'yomi or Chinese-derived pronunciation) of the same
characters that form the word kamikaze in Japanese. During World War II, the pronunciation
kamikaze was used in Japan only informally in relation to suicide attacks, but after the war
this usage gained acceptance worldwide and was re-imported into Japan. As a result, the
special attack units are sometimes known in Japan as kamikaze tokubetsu kÅ�geki tai .

Since the end of the war, the term kamikaze has sometimes been used for other kinds of attack in
which an attacker uses some form of vehicle as a weapon, sacrificing driver and vehicle. These
include a variety of suicide attacks, in other historical contexts, such as the proposed use
of Selbstopfer aircraft by Nazi Germany . In English, the word kamikaze is used in a hyperbolic
or metaphorical fashion to refer to non-fatal actions which result in significant loss for
the attacker, such as injury or the end of a career.

Model 52c Zeroes ready to take part in a kamikaze attack (early 1945). Prior to the formation of
kamikaze units, deliberate crashes had been used as a last resort when a pilot's plane was
severely damaged and he did not want to risk being captured, or he wanted to do as much damage to
the enemy as possible since he was crashing anyway; this was the case in both the Japanese and
Allied air forces. According to Axell & Kase, these suicides "were individual, impromptu
decisions by men who were mentally prepared to die." [ 2 ] In most cases, there is little
evidence that these hits were more than accidental collisions, of the kind that sometimes
happen in intense sea-air battles. One example of this occurred on 7 December 1941 during the
attack on Pearl Harbor . First Lieutenant Fusata Iida’s plane had been hit and was leaking
fuel, when he apparently used it to make a suicide attack on Kaneohe Naval Air Station . Before
taking off, he had told his men that if his plane was badly damaged he would crash it into a
"worthy enemy target". [ 3 ]

The carrier battles in 1942, particularly Midway , had inflicted irreparable damage on the
Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS), such that they could no longer put together a
large number of fleet carriers with well-trained aircrews. [ 4 ] Japanese planners had
assumed a quick war and were ill-prepared to replace the losses of ships, pilots, and sailors;
at Midway, the Japanese lost as many aircrewmen in a single day as their pre-war training
program had produced in a year. [ 5 ] The following Solomons and New Guinea campaigns , notably
the Battles of Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz , further decimated their veteran aircrews and
replacing their combat experience proved impossible. [ 6 ] During 1943–44, U.S. forces
were steadily advancing towards Japan. Japan's fighter planes were becoming outnumbered
and outclassed by newer U.S.-made planes, especially the F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair .
Tropical diseases, as well as shortages of spare parts and fuel , made operations more and more
difficult for the IJNAS. By the Battle of the Philippine Sea in 1944, the Japanese now had to
make do with obsolete aircraft and inexperienced aviators, against the better-trained and
more experienced US Navy airmen, and its radar -directed combat air patrols . The Japanese
lost over 400 carrier-based planes and pilots, effectively putting an end to their carriers'
potency, an action referred to by the Allies as the " Great Marianas Turkey Shoot ".

On 19 June 1944, planes from the carrier Chiyoda approached a US task group. According to some
accounts, two made suicide attacks, one of which hit USS Indiana . [ 7 ]

The important Japanese base of Saipan fell to the Allied forces on 15 July 1944. Its capture
provided adequate forward bases which enabled U.S. air forces using the B-29 Superfortress
to strike the Japanese home islands. After the fall of Saipan, the Japanese high command
predicted that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines , which were strategically
important because of their location between the oilfields of Southeast Asia and Japan.

In August 1944, it was announced by the Domei news agency that a flight instructor named Takeo
Tagata was training pilots in Taiwan for suicide missions. [ 8 ]

Another source claims that the first kamikaze mission occurred on 13 September 1944. A group
of pilots from the army's 31st Fighter Squadron on Negros Island decided to launch a suicide
attack the following morning. [ 9 ] First Lieutenant Takeshi Kosai and a sergeant were
selected. Two 100 kg (220 lb) bombs were attached to two fighters, and the pilots took off
before dawn, planning to crash into carriers. They never returned, but there is no record of an
enemy plane hitting an Allied ship that day.

According to some sources, on 14 October 1944, USS Reno was hit by a deliberately crashed
Japanese plane. [ 10 ] However, there is no evidence that the attacker planned to crash. [

Masafumi Arima Rear Admiral Masafumi Arima , the commander of the 26th Air Flotilla (part of
the 11th Air Fleet), is also sometimes credited with inventing the kamikaze tactic. Arima
personally led an attack by about 100 Yokosuka D4Y Suisei ("Judy") dive bombers against a
large Essex -class aircraft carrier , USS Franklin near Leyte Gulf, on (or about, accounts
vary) 15 October 1944. Arima was killed and part of a plane hit Franklin . The Japanese high
command and propagandists seized on Arima's example: he was promoted posthumously to
Admiral and was given official credit for making the first kamikaze attack. However, it is not
clear that this was a planned suicide attack, [ 11 ] and official Japanese accounts of Arima's
attack bore little resemblance to the actual events.

On 17 October 1944, Allied forces assaulted Suluan Island, beginning the Battle of Leyte Gulf
. The Imperial Japanese Navy's 1st Air Fleet, based at Manila , was assigned the task of
assisting the Japanese ships which would attempt to destroy Allied forces in Leyte Gulf.
However, the 1st Air Fleet at that time only had 40 aircraft: 34 A6M Zero carrier-based
fighters, three Nakajima B6N Tenzan ("Jill") torpedo bombers , one Mitsubishi G4M ("Betty")
and two Yokosuka P1Y Ginga ("Frances") land-based bombers, and one additional
reconnaissance plane. The task facing the Japanese air forces seemed impossible. The 1st Air
Fleet commandant, Vice Admiral TakijirÅ� ÅŒnishi decided to form a suicide attack
force, the Special Attack Unit. In a meeting at Mabalacat Airfield (known to the U.S. military
as Clark Air Base) near Manila, on 19 October, Onishi told officers of the 201st Flying Group
headquarters: "I don't think there would be any other certain way to carry out the operation
[to hold the Philippines], than to put a 250 kg bomb on a Zero and let it crash into a U.S. carrier,
in order to disable her for a week."



[ edit ] First kamikaze unit

Commander Asaiki Tamai asked a group of 23 talented student pilots, all of whom he had trained,
to volunteer for the special attack force. All of the pilots raised both of their hands,
volunteering to join the operation. Later, Tamai asked Lieutenant Yukio Seki to command the
special attack force. Seki is said to have closed his eyes, lowered his head and thought for 10
seconds, before saying: "Please do appoint me to the post." Seki became the 24th kamikaze
pilot to be chosen. However, Seki later said: "Japan's future is bleak if it is forced to kill
one of its best pilots." and "I am not going on this mission for the Emperor or for the Empire... I
am going because I was ordered to." [ 12 ]

The names of four sub-units within the Kamikaze Special Attack Force were Unit Shikishima ,
Unit Yamato , Unit Asahi , and Unit Yamazakura . [ 13 ] These names were taken from a patriotic
death poem (called jisei no ku in waka or tanka ), Shikishima no Yamato-gokoro wo hito towaba,
asahi ni niou yamazakura bana by the Japanese classical scholar, Motoori Norinaga . [ 14 ] The
poem reads:

If someone asks about the Yamato spirit [Spirit of Old/True Japan] of Shikishima [a poetic
name for Japan]—it is the flowers of yamazakura [mountain cherry blossom ] that are
fragrant in the Asahi [rising sun]. A less literal translation [ 15 ] is:

    

        Asked about the soul of Japan,

    

        I would say

    

        That it is

    

        Like wild cherry blossoms

    

        Glowing in the morning sun.

    

ÅŒnishi, addressing this unit, told that their nobility of spirit would keep the homeland
from ruin even in defeat. [ 16 ]

The bridge and forward turrets of the County -class heavy cruiser HMAS Australia , in
September 1944. The officer facing right is Captain Emile Dechaineux who was killed on 21
October 1944 in what is reported as the first kamikaze attack. Several suicide attacks,
carried out during the invasion of Leyte , by Japanese pilots from units other than the Special
Attack Force, have been described as the first kamikaze attack. Early on 21 October, a
Japanese aircraft, possibly a Aichi D3A dive-bomber [ 17 ] or a Mitsubishi Ki-51 (of the 6th
Flying Brigade, Imperial Japanese Army Air Force [ 18 ] ) deliberately crashed into the
foremast of the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia . [ 17 ] The attack killed 30 personnel, including
the cruiser's Captain, Emile Dechaineux and wounded 64, including the Australian force
commander Commodore John Collins . [ 17 ] The Australian official history of the war claimed
that this was the first kamikaze attack on an Allied ship, although other sources disagree
because it was not a planned attack by a member of the Special Attack Force, but was most likely
performed on the pilot's own initiative. [ 17 ]

The sinking of the ocean tug USS Sonoma on 24 October is listed in some sources as the first ship
lost to a kamikaze strike, but the attack occurred before 25 October, and the aircraft used, a
Mitsubishi G4M , was not flown by the original four Special Attack Squadrons. [ 19 ]

On 25 October 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf , the Kamikaze Special Attack Force carried
out its first mission. Five Zeros, led by Seki, and escorted to the target by leading Japanese
ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa , attacked several escort carriers . One Zero attempted to hit the
bridge of USS Kitkun Bay but instead exploded on the port catwalk and cartwheeled into the sea.
Two others dove at USS Fanshaw Bay but were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. The last two ran at
USS White Plains . One, under heavy fire and trailing smoke, aborted the attempt on White
Plains and instead banked toward USS St. Lo , plowing into the flight deck. Its bomb caused
fires that resulted in the bomb magazine exploding, sinking the carrier. [ 20 ] By day's end on
26 October 55 kamikazes from the special attack force had also damaged the large escort
carriers USS Sangamon , Suwannee which had also been struck by a Kamikaze at 0804 forward of its
aft elevator on 25 October, Santee , and the smaller escorts USS White Plains , Kalinin Bay , and
Kitkun Bay . In total, seven carriers had been hit, as well as 40 other ships (five sunk, 23
heavily damaged, and 12 moderately damaged).



[ edit ] Main wave of attacks

Early successes – such as the sinking of St. Lo – were followed by an immediate expansion of
the program, and over the next few months over 2,000 planes made such attacks.

When Japan began to be subject to intense strategic bombing by B-29s, the Japanese military
attempted to use suicide attacks against this threat. During the northern hemisphere winter
of 1944–45, the IJAAF formed the 47th Air Regiment, also known as the Shinten Special Unit (
Shinten Seiku Ta ) at Narimasu Airfield, Nerima, Tokyo , to defend the Tokyo Metropolitan Area
. The unit was equipped with Nakajima Ki-44 Shoki ("Tojo") fighters, with which they were to
ram United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29s in their attacks on Japan. However, this
proved much less successful and practical since an airplane is a much faster, more
maneuverable, and smaller target than a warship. The B-29 also had formidable defensive
weaponry, so suicide attacks against the plane demanded considerable piloting skill to be
successful. That worked against the very purpose of using expendable pilots and even
encouraging capable pilots to bail out before impact was ineffective because vital
personnel were often lost when they mistimed their exits and were killed as a result.

The kamikaze hits Columbia at 17:29. The plane and its bomb penetrated two decks before
exploding, killing 13 and wounding 44. Kamikaze attacks were being planned at far-flung
Japanese bases. On 8 January, Onishi formed a second official naval kamikaze unit, in Formosa
. [ citation needed ] The unit, Niitaka used Zeroes and "Judys", and was based at Takao Airfield
. On 29 January 1945, seven Kawasaki Ki-48 "Lilys" from the Japanese Army Shichisi Mitate
Special group, took off from Palembang, Sumatra to strike the British Pacific Fleet . Vice
Admiral Kimpei Teraoka and Captain Riishi Sugiyama of the 601st Air Group organized another
second special unit, Mitate at Iwo Jima on 16 February, as a U.S. invasion force approached. [
citation needed ] On 11 March, the U.S. carrier USS Randolph was hit and moderately damaged at
Ulithi Atoll , in the Caroline Islands, by a kamikaze that had flown almost 4,000 km (2,500 mi)
from Japan, in a mission called Operation Tan No. 2 . On 20 March, the submarine USS Devilfish
survived a hit from an aircraft, just off Japan.

Purpose-built kamikaze planes, as opposed to converted fighters and dive-bombers, were
also being constructed. Ensign Mitsuo Ohta had suggested that piloted glider bombs , carried
within range of targets by a mother plane, should be developed. The First Naval Air Technical
Bureau ( Kugisho ), in Yokosuka , refined Ohta's idea. Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka rocket planes ,
launched from bombers, were first deployed in kamikaze attacks from March 1945. U.S.
personnel gave them the derisive nickname "Baka Bombs" ( baka is Japanese for "idiot" or
"stupid"). The Nakajima Ki-115 Tsurugi was a simple, easily built propeller aircraft with a
wooden airframe which used engines from existing stocks. Its non-retractable landing gear
was jettisoned shortly after take-off for a suicide mission, and re-used. During 1945, the
Japanese military began stockpiling hundreds of Tsurugi , other aircraft, Ohkas , and
suicide boats, for use against Allied forces expected to invade Japan. The invasion never
happened, and few were ever used. [ 21 ]



[ edit ] Allied defensive tactics

In early 1945 U.S. Navy aviator Commander John Thach , already famous for developing
effective aerial tactics against the Japanese such as the Thach Weave , developed a defensive
strategy against kamikazes called the " big blue blanket ". This recommended combat air
patrols (CAP) which were larger and operated further from the carriers than before, a line of
picket destroyers and destroyer escorts at least 80 km (50 mi) from the main body of the fleet to
provide earlier radar interception, and improved coordination between fighter direction
officers on carriers. This plan also called for round-the-clock fighter patrols over Allied
fleets, though the U.S. Navy had cut back training of fighter pilots so there were not enough
Navy pilots available to counter the kamikaze threat. A final element included intensive
fighter sweeps over Japanese airfields, and bombing of Japanese runways, using delayed
action bombs to make repairs more difficult. [ 22 ]

An A6M Zero (A6M2 Model 21) towards the end of its run at the escort carrier USS White Plains on 25
October 1944. The aircraft exploded in mid-air, moments after the picture was taken,
scattering debris across the deck. Late in 1944 the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) used the good
high-altitude performance of their Supermarine Seafires (naval version of the Spitfire) on
combat air patrol duties. Seafires were heavily involved in countering the kamikaze attacks
during the Iwo Jima landings and beyond. The Seafires' best day was 15 August 1945, shooting
down eight attacking aircraft for a single loss.

Allied pilots were experienced and better-trained, and flew superior aircraft, making the
poorly trained kamikaze pilots easy targets. The U.S. Fast Carrier Task Force alone could
bring over 1,000 fighter aircraft into play. Allied pilots became adept at destroying enemy
aircraft before they struck ships.

Allied gunners had begun to develop techniques to negate kamikaze attacks. Light rapid fire
anti-aircraft weapons such as the 40 mm Bofors and 20 mm Oerlikon autocannons were highly
effective, [ 23 ] but heavy anti-aircraft guns such as the 5"/38 caliber gun (127 mm) had the
punch to blow kamikazes out of the air, which was preferable since even a heavily damaged
kamikaze could complete its mission. [ 24 ] The Ohkas with their high speed presented a very
difficult problem for anti-aircraft fire, since their high speed made a fire control
solution extremely difficult. By 1945, large amounts of anti-aircraft shells with radio
frequency proximity fuzes , on average seven times more effective than regular shells,
became available, and the USN recommended their use against kamikaze attacks.

The USS Louisville is struck by a kamikaze at the Battle of Lingayen Gulf , January 1945. The
peak in kamikaze attacks came during the period of April–June 1945, at the Battle of Okinawa
. On 6 April 1945, waves of planes made hundreds of attacks in Operation Kikusui ("floating
chrysanthemums"). [ 25 ] At Okinawa, kamikaze attacks focused at first on Allied destroyers
on picket duty, and then on the carriers in the middle of the fleet. Suicide attacks by planes or
boats at Okinawa sank or put out of action at least 30 U.S. warships, [ 26 ] and at least three U.S.
merchant ships , [ 27 ] along with some from other Allied forces. The attacks expended 1,465
planes. Many warships of all classes were damaged, some severely, but no aircraft carriers,
battleships or cruisers were sunk by kamikaze at Okinawa. Most of the ships lost were
destroyers or smaller vessels, especially those on picket duty. [ 26 ] The destroyer USS
Laffey earned the nickname "The Ship That Would Not Die" after surviving sixteen kamikaze
attacks, including five hits during this battle. [ 28 ]

Aircraft carrier HMS Formidable (67) after being struck by a Kamikaze off Sakishima Islands .
The kamikaze made a massive dent about 3 m long, 0.6 m wide and deep in the armoured flight deck.
Eight crew members were killed, forty-seven were wounded, and eleven aircraft were
destroyed. U.S. carriers, with their wooden flight decks, appeared to suffer more damage
from kamikaze hits than the reinforced steel-decked carriers from the British Pacific Fleet
. US carriers also suffered considerably heavier casualties from kamikaze strikes; for
instance, 389 men were killed in one attack on USS Bunker Hill , greater than the combined
number of fatal casualties suffered on all six RN armoured carriers from all forms of attack
during the entire war. Eight kamikaze hits on five RN carriers resulted in only twenty fatal
casualties while a combined total of 15 bomb hits, most of 500 kg weight or greater, and one
torpedo hit on 4 carriers caused 193 fatal casualties earlier in the war – striking proof of
the protective value of the armoured flight deck. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The resilience of well-armoured
vessels was shown on 4 May, just after 11:30, when there was a wave of suicide attacks against
the BPF. One Japanese plane made a steep dive from "a great height" at the carrier HMS
Formidable and was engaged by AA guns. [ 31 ] Although it was hit by gunfire, the kamikaze
crashed into the flight deck, making a crater 3 m (9.8 ft) long, 0.6 m (2 ft) wide and 0.6 m (2 ft)
deep. A long steel splinter speared down, through the hangar deck and the main boiler room
(where it ruptured a steam line), before coming to rest in a fuel tank near the aircraft park,
where it started a major fire. Eight personnel were killed and 47 were wounded. One Corsair and
10 Avengers were destroyed. However, the fires were gradually brought under control, and the
crater in the deck was repaired with concrete and steel plate. By 17:00, Corsairs were able to
land. On 9 May, Formidable was again damaged by a kamikaze , as were the carrier HMS Victorious
and the battleship HMS Howe . The British were able to clear the flight deck and resume flight
operations in just hours, while their American counterparts took a few days or even months, as
observed by a USN liaison officer on HMS Indefatigable who commented: "When a kamikaze hits a
U.S. carrier it means 6 months of repair at Pearl [Harbor] . When a kamikaze hits a Limey carrier
it’s just a case of "Sweepers, man your brooms."”

Sometimes twin-engined aircraft were used in planned kamikaze attacks. For example,
Mitsubishi Ki-67 HiryÅ« ("Peggy") medium bombers, based on Formosa, undertook kamikaze
attacks on Allied forces off Okinawa.

Rear Admiral Matome Ugaki , the second in command of the Combined Pacific Fleet, directed the
last official kamikaze attack, sending "Judies" from the 701st Air Group against the Allied
fleet at Okinawa on 15 August 1945.

Intrepid 25 November 1944 As the end of the war approached, the Allies did not suffer
significantly more serious losses, despite having far more ships and facing a greater
intensity of kamikaze attacks. Although causing some of the heaviest casualties on US
carriers in 1945, the IJN had sacrificed 2,525 kamikaze pilots and the IJAAF 1,387; far more
than they had lost in 1942 where they sunk or crippled three carriers (albeit without
inflicting significant casualties). In 1942 when US Navy vessels were scarce, the temporary
absence of key warships from the combat zone would tie up operational initiatives. However,
by 1945, the US Navy was large enough that damaged ships could be detached back home for repair
without significantly hampering the fleet's operational capability. The only surface
losses were destroyers and smaller ships that lacked the capability to sustain heavy damage.
Overall, the kamikazes were unable to turn the tide of the war and stop the Allied invasion. The
destructive potential of the kamikaze sustained postwar funding of Operation Bumblebee
until the RIM-8 Talos guided missile became operational in 1959. [ 32 ]

In the immediate aftermath of kamikaze strikes, British carriers with their armoured flight
decks appeared to recover more quickly compared to their US counterparts . However, post-war
analysis showed that some British carriers such as HMS Formidable did suffer structural
damage that led them to be written off and scrapped, as beyond economic repair, but Britain's
dire post war finances and the constantly declining size of the Royal Navy undoubtedly played
a role in deciding not to repair damaged carriers. By contrast, even the most seriously
damaged American carriers such USS Bunker Hill were successfully repaired to operational
condition, although they saw no service after World War II as they were considered surplus.

The number of ships sunk is a matter of debate. According to a wartime Japanese propaganda
announcement, the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195, and according to a Japanese tally,
kamikaze attacks accounted for up to 80% of the U.S. losses in the final phase of the war in the
Pacific. In a 2004 book, World War II , the historians Wilmott, Cross and Messenger stated that
more than 70 U.S. vessels were "sunk or damaged beyond repair" by kamikazes .

According to a U.S Air Force webpage:

    

        Approximately 2,800 Kamikaze attackers sunk 34 Navy ships, damaged 368 others,
        killed 4,900 sailors, and wounded over 4,800. Despite radar detection and cuing,
        airborne interception and attrition, and massive anti-aircraft barrages, a
        distressing 14 percent of Kamikazes survived to score a hit on a ship; nearly 8.5
        percent of all ships hit by Kamikazes sank. [ 33 ]

    

Australian journalists Denis and Peggy Warner, in a 1982 book with Japanese naval historian
Seno Sadao ( The Sacred Warriors: Japan’s Suicide Legions ), arrived at a total of 57 ships
sunk by kamikazes . However, Bill Gordon, an American Japanologist who specialises in
kamikazes , lists in a 2007 article 47 ships known to have been sunk by kamikaze aircraft. [ 19 ]
Gordon says that the Warners and Seno included ten ships that did not sink. He lists:

    

    - three escort carriers: USS St. Lo , USS Ommaney Bay , and USS Bismarck Sea

    

    - 14 destroyers, including the last ship to be sunk, USS Callaghan (DD-792) on 29 July
    1945, off Okinawa

    

    - three high-speed transport ships

    

    - five Landing Ship, Tank

    

    - four Landing Ship Medium

    

    - three Landing Ship Medium (Rocket)

    

    - one auxiliary tanker

    

    - three Canadian Victory ships

    

    - three Liberty ships

    

    - two high-speed minesweepers

    

    - one Auk class minesweeper

    

    - one submarine chaser

    

    - two PT boats

    

    - two Landing Craft Support

    

Over 300 Allied warships were damaged by kamikaze attacks. [ citation needed ]

Japanese Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka ("cherry blossom"), a specially built rocket-powered
kamikaze aircraft used towards the end of the war. The U.S. called them Baka Bombs ("idiot").
It was claimed by the Japanese forces at the time that there were many volunteers for the
suicidal forces. Captain Motoharu Okamura commented that "there were so many volunteers for
suicide missions that he referred to them as a swarm of bees," explaining: "Bees die after they
have stung." [ 34 ] Okamura is credited with being the first to propose the kamikaze attacks. He
had expressed his desire to lead a volunteer group of suicide attacks some four months before
Admiral Takijiro Ohnishi , commander of the Japanese naval air forces in the Philippines,
presented the idea to his staff. While Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome , commander of the second
air fleet, was inspecting the 341st Air Group, Captain Okamura took the chance to express his
ideas on crash-dive tactics. “In our present situation I firmly believe that the only way to
swing the war in our favor is to resort to crash-dive attacks with our planes. There is no other
way. There will be more than enough volunteers for this chance to save our country, and I would
like to command such an operation. Provide me with 300 planes and I will turn the tide of war.”
[ 35 ] When the volunteers arrived for duty in the corps there were twice as many persons as
aircraft. "After the war, some commanders would express regret for allowing superfluous
crews to accompany sorties, sometimes squeezing themselves aboard bombers and fighters so
as to encourage the suicide pilots and, it seems, join in the exultation of sinking a large
enemy vessel." Many of the kamikaze pilots believed their death would pay the debt they owed
and show the love they had for their families, friends, and emperor. "So eager were many
minimally trained pilots to take part in suicide missions that when their sorties were
delayed or aborted, the pilots became deeply despondent. Many of those who were selected for a
bodycrashing mission were described as being extraordinarily blissful immediately before
their final sortie." [ 36 ]

As time wore on, however, modern critics questioning the nationalist portrayal of kamikaze
pilots as noble soldiers willing to sacrifice their lives for the country have emerged. In
2006, Tsuneo Watanabe , Editor-in-Chief of the Yomiuri Shimbun , criticized Japanese
nationalists' glorification of kamikaze attacks: [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ]

"It's all a lie that they left filled with braveness and joy, crying, 'Long live the emperor!'
They were sheep at a slaughterhouse. Everybody was looking down and tottering. Some were
unable to stand up and were carried and pushed into the plane by maintenance soldiers."

[ edit ] Training

When you eliminate all thoughts about life and death, you will be able to totally disregard
your earthly life. This will also enable you to concentrate your attention on eradicating the
enemy with unwavering determination, meanwhile reinforcing your excellence in flight
skills. —An excerpt from a kamikaze pilots' manual. TokkÅ�tai pilot training, as
described by Kasuga Takeo, [ 40 ] generally "consisted of incredibly strenuous training,
coupled with cruel and torturous corporal punishment as a daily routine." Irokawa Daikichi,
who trained at Tsuchiura Naval Air Base, recalled that he "was struck on the face so hard and
frequently that [his] face was no longer recognizable." He also wrote: "I was hit so hard that I
could no longer see and fell on the floor. The minute I got up, I was hit again by a club so that I
would confess." This brutal "training" was justified by the idea that it would instill a
"soldier's fighting spirit." However, daily beatings and corporal punishment eliminated
patriotism among many pilots. [ 41 ]

Pilots were given a manual which detailed how they were supposed to think, prepare, and
attack. From this manual, pilots were told to "attain a high level of spiritual training," and
to "keep [their] health in the very best condition." These things, among others, were meant to
put the pilot into the mindset in which he would be mentally ready to die.

The tokkÅ�tai pilot's manual also explained how a pilot may turn back if the pilot could not
locate a target and that "[a pilot] should not waste [his] life lightly." However, one pilot
who continually came back to base was shot after his ninth return. [ 41 ]

We tried to live with 120 percent intensity, rather than waiting for death. We read and read,
trying to understand why we had to die in our early twenties. We felt the clock ticking away
towards our death, every sound of the clock shortening our lives. Irokawa Daikichi, Kamikaze
Diaries: Reflections of Japanese Student Soldiers The manual was very detailed in how a pilot
should attack. A pilot would dive towards his target and "aim for a point between the bridge
tower and the smoke stacks". Entering a smoke stack was also said to be "effective". Pilots
were told not to aim at a ship's bridge tower or gun turret but instead to look for elevators or
the flight deck to crash into. For horizontal attacks, the pilot was to "aim at the middle of the
vessel, slightly higher than the waterline" or to "aim at the entrance to the aircraft hangar,
or the bottom of the stack" if the former was too difficult.

The tokkÅ�tai pilot's manual told pilots never to close their eyes. This was because if a
pilot closed his eyes he would lower the chances of hitting his target. In the final moments
before the crash, the pilot was to yell " Hissatsu " (å¿…æ®º) at the top of his lungs
which translates to "Certain Kill".

26 May 1945. Corporal Yukio Araki, holding a puppy, with four other pilots of the 72nd Shinbu
Squadron at Bansei , Kagoshima . Araki died the following day, at age 17, in a suicide attack on
ships near Okinawa. In 1944–45, the Japanese were heavily influenced by Shinto beliefs.
Among other things, Emperor worship was stressed after Shinto was established as a state
religion during the Meiji Restoration . As time went on, Shinto was used increasingly in the
promotion of nationalist sentiment. In 1890, the Imperial Rescript on Education was passed,
under which students were required to ritually recite its oath to offer themselves
"courageously to the State" as well as protect the Imperial family. The ultimate offering was
to give up one’s life. It was an honour to die for Japan and the Emperor. Axell and Kase pointed
out: "The fact is that innumerable soldiers, sailors and pilots were determined to die, to
become eirei, that is ‘guardian spirits’ of the country. [...] Many Japanese felt that to
be enshrined at Yasukuni was a special honour because the Emperor twice a year visited the
shrine to pay homage. Yasukuni is the only shrine, deifying common men, which the Emperor
would visit to pay his respects". [ 34 ] Young Japanese people were indoctrinated from an
earliest age with these ideals.

Following the commencement of the kamikaze tactic, newspapers and books ran
advertisements, articles, and stories regarding the suicide bombers, to aid in recruiting
and support. In October 1944, the Nippon Times quoted Lieutenant Sekio Nishina: "The spirit
of the Special Attack Corps is the great spirit that runs in the blood of every Japanese…. The
crashing action which simultaneously kills the enemy and oneself without fail is called the
Special Attack…. Every Japanese is capable of becoming a member of the Special Attack
Corps". [ 42 ] Publishers also played up the idea that the kamikaze were enshrined at Yasukuni
and ran exaggerated stories of kamikaze bravery – there were even fairy tales for little
children that promoted the kamikaze . A Foreign Office official named Toshikazu Kase said:
"It was customary for GHQ [in Tokyo] to make false announcements of victory in utter disregard
of facts, and for the elated and complacent public to believe them". [ 43 ]

While many stories were falsified, some were true, such as the story of Kiyu Ishikawa who saved
a Japanese ship when he crashed his plane into a torpedo that an American submarine had
launched. The sergeant major was posthumously promoted to second lieutenant by the emperor
and was enshrined at Yasukuni. [ 44 ] Stories like these, which showed the kind of praise and
honour death produced, encouraged young Japanese to volunteer for the Special Attack Corps
and instilled a desire in the youth to die as a kamikaze .

Ceremonies were carried out before kamikaze pilots departed on their final mission. They
were given the flag of Japan or the rising sun flag (Japanese naval ensign), inscribed with
inspirational and spiritual words, Nambu pistol or katana and drank sake before they took off
generally. They put on a hachimaki headband with the rising sun, and a senninbari , a "belt of a
thousand stitches" sewn by a thousand women who made one stitch each. [ 45 ] They also composed
and read a death poem , a tradition stemming from the samurai , who did it before committing
seppuku . Pilots carried prayers from their families and were given military decorations .

Chiran high school girls wave farewell with cherry blossom branches to departing kamikaze
pilot in a Ki-43 -II Hayabusa . While commonly perceived that volunteers signed up in droves
for kamikaze missions, it has also been contended that there was extensive coercion and peer
pressure involved in recruiting soldiers for the sacrifice. Their motivations in
"volunteering" were complex and not simply about patriotism or bringing honour to their
families. And at least one of these pilots was a conscripted Korean with a Japanese name,
adopted under the pre-war Soshi-kaimei ordinance that compelled Koreans to take Japanese
personal names. [ 46 ] Eleven of the 1,036 IJA kamikaze pilots who died in sorties from Chiran
and other Japanese air bases during the Battle of Okinawa were Koreans. [ 47 ] [ 48 ]

It is said that young pilots on kamikaze missions often flew southwest from Japan over the 922 m
(3,025 ft) Mount Kaimon. The mountain is also called " Satsuma Fuji " (meaning a mountain like
Mount Fuji but located in the Satsuma Province region). Suicide mission pilots looked over
their shoulders to see this, the most southern mountain on the Japanese mainland, while they
were in the air, said farewell to their country, and saluted the mountain.

Residents on Kikaishima Island , east of Amami ÅŒshima , say that pilots from suicide
mission units dropped flowers from the air as they departed on their final missions. It is said
that the hills above Kikaishima airport have beds of cornflower that bloom in early May. [ 49 ]

Kamikaze pilots who were unable to complete their mission (due to mechanical failure,
interception, etc.) were stigmatized in the years following the war. This stigma began to
diminish some 50 years after the war as scholars and publishers have distributed the
survivor's stories. [ 50 ]

With the passing of time, some prominent Japanese military figures who survived the war
became critical of the policy. Saburo Sakai , an IJN ace said:

"A kamikaze is a surprise attack, according to our ancient war tactics. Surprise attacks will
be successful the first time, maybe two or three times. But what fool would continue the same
attacks for ten months? Emperor Hirohito must have realized it. He should have said 'Stop.'



"Even now, many faces of my students come up when I close my eyes. So many students are gone. Why
did headquarters continue such silly attacks for ten months! Fools! Genda , who went to
America—all those men lied that all men volunteered for kamikaze units. They lied."

[ edit ] Quotations

I cannot predict the outcome of the air battles, but you will be making a mistake if you should
regard Special Attack operations as normal methods. The right way is to attack the enemy with
skill and return to the base with good results. A plane should be utilized over and over again.
That’s the way to fight a war. The current thinking is skewed. Otherwise, you cannot expect
to improve air power. There will be no progress if flyers continue to die.

—Lieutenant Commander Iwatani, Taiyo (Ocean) magazine, March 1945. [ 44 ] Zwei Seelen
wohnen auch in mein[em] Herz[en] !! (Ah, two souls [tamashi’i] reside in my heart
[kokoro]!!) After all I am just a human being. Sometimes, my chest pounds with excitement when
I think of the day I will fly into the sky. I trained my mind and body as hard as I could and am
anxious for the day I can use them to their full capacity in fighting. I think my life and death
belong to the mission. Yet, at other times, I envy those science majors who remain at home
[exempt from the draft]. … One of my souls looks to heaven, while the other is attracted to the
earth. I wish to enter the Navy as soon as possible so that I can devote myself to the task. I hope
that the days when I am tormented by stupid thoughts will pass quickly.

—Sasaki Hachiro [ 51 ] It is easy to talk about death in the abstract, as the ancient
philosophers discussed. But it is real death I fear, and I don’t know if I can overcome the
fear. Even for a short life, there are many memories. For someone who had a good life, it is very
difficult to part with it. But I reached a point of no return. I must plunge into an enemy vessel.

To be honest, I cannot say that the wish to die for the emperor is genuine, coming from my heart.
However, it is decided for me that I die for the emperor.

—Hayashi Ichizo [ 52 ] I am pleased to have the honour of having been chosen as a member of a
Special Attack Force that is on its way into battle, but I cannot help crying when I think of you,
Mum. When I reflect on the hopes you had for my future ... I feel so sad that I am going to die
without doing anything to bring you joy.

—Ichizo Hayashi, last letter home a few days before his final flight. April 1945 [ 53 ]

Kamikaze

Transcend life and death. When you eliminate all thoughts about life and death, you will be
able to totally disregard your earthly life. This will also enable you to concentrate your
attention on eradicating the enemy with unwavering determination, meanwhile reinforcing
your excellence in flight skills. - A paragraph from the Kamikaze pilot's manual, located in
their cockpits.

In the year 1281, Japan was under attack by a Mongol invasion — led by the powerful Kublai
Khan. However, just as it appeared that the invading Mongols were about to overwhelm the
Japanese, a catastrophic typhoon swept through the land, eliminating the entire Mongol
army. From that point on, the typhoon that saved Japan became known as the Kamikaze or Divine
Wind.

Background

After the defeat at the Battle of Midway , and the fall of Saipan in July 1944, the Japanese
revived the name Kamikaze and ascribed it to the suicide missions of their air force.

Japanese Vice Admiral Takashiro Ohnishi, commander of the First Air Fleet in the
Philippines, had noted that the most effective way to inflict damage upon Allied warships was
to crash planes into them. He noted that one accidental crash could do more damage than 10
planes firing machine guns. It was decided then that pilots would purposely crash their
planes — with half a ton of explosives — into American warships.

The Kamikaze pilot

Generally, Kamikaze pilots were university students motivated by obligation, and loyalty
to family and country. A typical pilot was a science student in his twenties. He prepared for
his fiery destiny by writing farewell letters and poems to loved ones, receiving a
"thousand-stitch sash*," and by holding a ceremony — a drink of water that gave him a
"spiritual lifting" before wedging himself between 550-pound bombs.

It was adamantly believed that, because they were fighting for their Emperor God, the
Kamikaze would bring them deliverance at the darkest hour, just as it had in the 13th century.
In fact, the call for Kamikaze pilots drew a staggering response. Three times as many applied
for suicide flights as the number of planes available. Experienced pilots were turned down.
They were needed to train the younger men how to fly to their deaths.

The fact that they were to go on suicide missions was accepted without question by the Japanese
pilots. All inductees into the Japanese armed forces were indoctrinated with the following
five-point oath:





- A soldier must make loyalty his obligation.





- A soldier must make propriety his way of life.





- A soldier must highly esteem military valor.





- A soldier must have a high regard for righteousness.





- A soldier must live a simple life.

The Mitsubishi A6M2

Nicknamed the "Zero," the Mitsubishi A6M2 was the Kamikaze pilot's personal "flying
coffin." It had a maximum speed of 332 mph and a range of 1,930 miles. The A6M2 was 29 feet nine
inches long, with a wingspan of about 39 feet. The aircraft was armed with two machine guns and
could carry 264 pounds of bombs; however, the Japanese modified its structure to accommodate
a heavier arsenal. The Zero was the main strike aircraft used at Pearl Harbor — dominating
the skies during the early stages of World War II . A large number were shot down during the
Battle of Midway, and it eventually became outperformed by the latest allied aircraft, such
as the P-51 Mustang.

First attacks

Beginning with the Pearl Harbor Attack, Japanese suicide bombers sporadically crashed
their planes into the enemy as a spur-of-the-moment decision.

On October 21, 1944, the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy, the heavy cruiser HMAS
Australia , was hit by a Japanese plane carrying a 441-pound bomb, off Leyte Island . Although
the bomb did not explode, the damage was devastating — killing at least 30 crew members.



Image: http://www.ohwy.com/history%20pictures/stlo.gif

On October 25, the Australia was hit again and was forced to retire to the New Hebrides for
repairs. That same day, five Zeros attacked a U.S. escort carrier, the USS St. Lo off the
Philippines coast, although only one Kamikaze actually hit the ship. Its bomb caused massive
fires that resulted in the ship's bomb magazine exploding, sinking the carrier. Japanese
pilots also hit and damaged several other Allied ships.

The initial successes of those attacks sparked an immediate expansion of the program. During
the next few months, more than 2,000 planes staged such attacks. Those included new types of
suicide attacks and explosives, including purpose-built Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka rocket-bombs,
small boats packed with explosives, and manned torpedoes (equipped with a 3000-pound
warhead) called the Kaiten.

Iwo Jima and Okinawa

On February 19th, 1945, the USS Enterprise and other carriers took up stations off Iwo Jima ,
attacking nearby enemy airfields, and providing close air support for the Marines that
landed. By the time the marines unfurled the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima's summit, Kamikaze attacks
had sunk the escort flattop Bismarck Sea CVE-95, knocked the USS Saratoga CV 3 out of the war for
good, and temporarily halted the Enterprise — all while regularly harassing amphibious
forces at the beachhead.

The day of April 6th, 1945, proved to be most telling for the use of Kamikazes in the battle for
Okinawa . More than 350 aircraft at a time dove at the Allied fleet. Just the anticipation of
Kamikaze attacks drove some American sailors literally insane. The destroyer Laffey was
attacked by 20 aircraft at once. Her gunners stopped nine Kamikazes, but six others rammed
into the ship. As on the similarly damaged USS Franklin , ineffable courage, and intensive
training in firefighting, kept the Laffey afloat.



Image: http://www.ohwy.com/history%20pictures/bunkerhi.gif

On the 7th of April, Kamikazes were still attacking in great numbers off the coast of Okinawa,
severely damaging the carrier Hancock . By April 16th, suicide bombers desperately, but
effectively damaged the USS Enterprise yet again, as well as the flattop USS Intrepid , and
numerous picket destroyers were sunk or damaged. Admiral Marc A. Mitscher led Task Force 58
from his flagship, the carrier Bunker Hill CV-17. On May 11th, 1945, the flagship was hit by a
Kamikaze pilot that killed 350 of his men.

The final Japanese defense of Okinawa was hard fought. For the Americans, victory brought a
heavy price. The capture of Okinawa cost the Americans 49,000 in casualties, of whom 12,520
died. More than 110,000 Japanese were killed on the island. When it was clear that he had been
defeated, General Mitsuru Ushijima committed ritual suicide (hara-kiri).

War's end

From October 25, 1944, to January 25, 1945, Kamikazes managed to sink two escort carriers and
three destroyers. They also damaged 23 carriers, five battleships, nine cruisers, 23
destroyers and 27 other ships. American casualties amounted to 738 killed and another 1,300
wounded as the result of those attacks.

Several thousand Kamikaze planes had been set aside for an invasion of the Japanese mainland
that never happened. Kamikaze pilots were one of the reasons President Harry S. Truman
decided to drop the atomic bombs .
