Early life



Duncan was born inÂ  Chicago ,Â  Illinois , and grew up in a single-parent household with
his sister, Judy, and mother, Jean Duncan (a house cleaner), after his father left. [1] [2]
Â He always wanted to act, but had to drop out of the Communications program atÂ  Alcorn
State University Â to support his family when his mother became ill. Duncan’s large
frameâ€”6 feet 5Â inches (196Â cm) [3] Â and 315 pounds
(142Â kg)â€”helped him in his jobs digging ditches for the People’s Gas Company
and being aÂ  bouncer Â at several Chicago clubs. [4] [ betterÂ sourceÂ needed ]

In 1979, he participated in theÂ  Disco Demolition Night Â atÂ  Comiskey Park , home of
theÂ  Chicago White Sox , where he was among the first 100 people to run onto the field and he
slid into third base. During the ensuing riot his silver belt buckle was stolen [5] while he was
stealing a baseball bat from the dugout. [6]

Career



Duncan took other security jobs while in Los Angeles while trying to get some acting work in
commercials. During this time, he worked as a bodyguard for celebrities likeÂ  Will Smith
,Â  Martin Lawrence ,Â  Jamie Foxx ,Â  LL Cool J , andÂ  The Notorious B.I.G. , all the
while doing bit parts in television and films. When the Notorious B.I.G. was killed in 1997,
Duncan quit this line of work. [3]

In 1998, Duncan was cast as Bear in the filmÂ  Armageddon , where he struck up a friendship
with castmateÂ  Bruce Willis . It was Bruce Willis’ influence that helped him to get his
breakout role as John Coffey in theÂ  Frank Darabont -directedÂ  The Green Mile , a role
which netted him anÂ  Academy Award Â nomination forÂ  Best Actor in a Supporting Role
and aÂ  Golden Globe Â nomination forÂ  Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting
Role in a Motion Picture . [7] [8]

Duncan then was cast in a string of films that helped to establish him as a star:Â  The Whole
Nine Yards ,Â  Planet of the Apes ,Â  The Scorpion King Â (where he starred alongside
his friend,Â  The Rock ),Â  The Island Â andÂ  Daredevil Â (reuniting him
withÂ  Armageddon Â co-starÂ  Ben Affleck ) as Wilson Fisk, akaÂ  The Kingpin .

Duncan signed on for the role of the Kingpin in January 2002, though he had been attached far
earlier. [9] Â When he was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the
role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30
minutes a day, andÂ  power-lifted Â with one or two reps a day, as well as eating whatever
he wanted. Despite this, Duncan’s biggest concern was that he was black, because Kingpin
had always been portrayed as white. [10] Â He spoke on the fans’ loyalty to the source
material by saying “they watch movies to say, ‘Hey, that’s not like the comic book.’
But I want them to get past that and just see the movie for what it is and see me for what I
amâ€”an actor.” [11]

In July 2006, Duncan showed interest in returning for the role of the Kingpin, but stated that
he would not be willing to gain weight as he felt “comfortable” being down to 270 pounds.
However, he jokingly showed willingness to change his mind if he were offered $20 million.
Duncan suggested that the character be portrayed as having been training a lot in jail in order
to become faster in combat against Daredevil, also working as a way to fit his weight loss into
the story. [12] Â In 2009, he stopped eatingÂ  meat Â and later appeared in aÂ  PETA
Â ad campaign, touting the health benefits and his increased strength from aÂ 
vegetarian diet . [13]

Duncan also provided his voice for a number of roles, includingÂ  Brother Bear Â and its
sequel,Â  Brother Bear 2 ,Â  The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses ,Â 
Quiznos commercials, and the video gamesÂ  Demon Stone ,Â  SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs
,Â  The Suffering: Ties That Bind ,Â  Saints Row , andÂ  Soldier of Fortune , with his
most recent role beingÂ  God of War II , where he provides the voice ofÂ  Atlas , theÂ 
Titan Â condemned byÂ  Zeus Â to stand at the western edge of the earth and hold up the
sky on his shoulders. He reprised his role as the Kingpin inÂ  Spider-Man: The New Animated
Series .

In 2005, he starred in the filmÂ  Sin City Â (again alongside Bruce Willis) as Manute, a
powerful mobster. Duncan appeared in a minor role in the 2006 movieÂ  Talladega Nights: The
Ballad of Ricky Bobby Â as Lucius Washington, and he voiced the role of the villain Massive
inÂ  Loonatics Unleashed . In 2006, he voiced the role of Numbuh 26 in the animated movieÂ 
Codename: Kids Next Door: Operation ZERO . Additionally, he played Balrog inÂ  Street
Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li Â and voiced the prison commander in Kung Fu Panda .

He also guest starred in numerous television shows. He appeared in an episode ofÂ  The Suite
Life of Zack & Cody , titled “Benchwarmers”, as Zack’s basketball coach, Coach Little.
In 2005, Duncan guest-starred in a first-season episode ofÂ  CSI: NY . [14] Â He appeared
as “Colt” in the second-season premiere ofÂ  Chuck , “ Chuck Versus The First Date
“. [15] Â In November he appeared as a guest star on theÂ  CBS Â showÂ  Two and a Half
Men . In April 2011 Duncan guest starred on an episode of TV seriesÂ  Bones Â as Leo Knox. In
2012, Duncan got his first starring role as the same character in the spinoff seriesÂ  The
Finder . In the same year, he appeared in aÂ  public service announcement advertising the
importance of knowing early-onset symptoms ofÂ  strokes . During the week of May 14, 2012,
Duncan appeared on the late night talk showÂ  The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson Â as a
guest, when the show was taping for a week inÂ  Scotland .

Illness and death



On July 13, 2012, Duncan was taken to a hospital after suffering aÂ  heart attack . [16]
Â Media reports suggested that his girlfriend,Â  Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth , had
previously tried to save his life by performingÂ  CPR . [17] Â Duncan’s publicist, Joy
Fehily, issued a statement on August 6 that read he was moved from theÂ  Intensive-care unit
Â but remained hospitalized following his heart attack. [18]

On September 3, Fehily quoted Manigault as saying that Duncan had died in Los Angeles. He added
that celebrations of Duncan’s life would be announced at a later date. [19] [20] Â The
statement also, for the first time, described Manigault as Duncan’s fiancÃ©e. [21]
