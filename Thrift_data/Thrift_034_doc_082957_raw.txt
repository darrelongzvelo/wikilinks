The One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Orthodox Christian Church is:





(a) The Body of Christ

(b) The community of believers and followers of Jesus Christ since Pentecost â€” that
point in time at which that community has been guided by The Holy Spirit, as had been promised by
Our Lord prior to His Crucifixion and Resurrection:

[John 16:13: â€œHowever, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all
truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He
will tell you things to come.â€� Matthew 16:18: "And I also say to you that you are Peter,
and on this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against
it.â€�]

(c) The same yesterday, today and forever , just as Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today
and forever [Hebrews 13:8]

(d) One , as Jesus Christ Himself is One and Indivisible

(e) Holy ; sacramental; liturgical – as opposed to being merely some sort of club for social
networking, or activism, or community organizing, or debating, or â€Š. whatever is the
trend of the week

(f) Catholic ; universal; The Church for all of humanity in all places at all times, and also
with each â€œChurchâ€� â€” each place of Orthodox worship, and each
Autocephalous Church â€” complete in itself as the nexus between time and eternity,
between Heaven and Earth.

(g) Apostolic ; in continuity â€” both temporally and in terms of teachings and
tradition â€” with the Apostles, who themselves were guided by Our Lord and Saviour, and
who were in continuity with the teachings and traditions of the Israelite people prior to the
temporal ministry of Jesus, the Messiah

(h) Orthodox ; of correct teachings, correct worship, correct glorification.Â  Lex
orandi, lex credendi .

The History of the Church is a vital part of the Orthodox Christian faith. Orthodox Christians
are defined significantly by their continuity with all those who have gone before, those who
first received and preached the truth of Jesus Christ to the world, those who helped to
formulate the expression and worship of our faith, and those who continue to move forward in
the unchanging yet ever-dynamic Holy Tradition of the Orthodox Church .

    Notes

    - Some of these dates are necessarily a bit vague, as records for some periods are
    particularly difficult to piece together accurately.

    

    - The division of Church History into separate eras as done here will always be to some
    extent arbitrary, though it was attempted to group periods according to major watershed
    events.

    

    - This timeline is necessarily biased toward the history of the Orthodox Church , though a
    number of non-Orthodox or purely political events are mentioned for their importance in
    history related to Orthodoxy or for reference.

    Our Confession Of Faith

    

    -

    We Believe…

    

    We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things
    visible and invisible;

    And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-Begotten, Begotten of the Father
    before all worlds, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, Begotten, not made; of one essence
    with the Father, by Whom all things were made:

    Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy
    Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man;

    And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried;

    And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures;

    And ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father;

    And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, Whose kingdom shall
    have no end.

    And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the
    Father, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke by
    the Prophets;

    And we believe in One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.

    We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins.

    We look for the Resurrection of the dead,

    And the Life of the world to come. Amen. â€

    Churchless Christianity?

    

    "The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs,
    and lying wonders, and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because
    they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

    And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie,
    that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in
    unrighteousness. But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved
    by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through
    sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth, to which He called you by our gospel,
    for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

    Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether
    by word or our epistle."

    - II Thessalonians 2:9-15

    ~~~ ~ â€  ~ ~~~

    "But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one. And we
    have confidence in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we
    command you. Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience
    of Christ.

    But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from
    every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received
    from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly
    among you;"

    - II Thessalonians 3:3-7

    ~~~ ~ â€  ~ ~~~

    "These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly; but if I am delayed, I
    write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the
    Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
