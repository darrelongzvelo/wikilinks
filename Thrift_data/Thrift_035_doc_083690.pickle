It was the most widespread war in history, with more than 100 million military personnel mobilised. In a state of &quot;total war,&quot; the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by significant events involving the mass death of civilians, including the Holocaust and the only use of nuclear weapoms in warfare, it was the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in 50 million to over 70 million fatalities.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The war is generally accepted to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany and Slovakia, and subsequent declaration of war on Germany by France and most of the countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth. Germany set out to establish a large empire in Europe. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or subdued much of continental Europe; amid Nazi-Soviet agreements, the nominally neutral Soviet Union fully or partially occupied and annexed territories of its six European neighbours. Britain and the Commonwealth remained the only major force continuing the fight against the Axis in North Africa and in extensive naval warfare. In June 1941, the European Axis launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, giving a start to the largest land theatre of war history, which, from this moment on, was tying down the major part of the Axis military power. In December 1941, Japan, which had been at war with China since 1937, and aimed to dominate Asia, attacked the United States and European possessions in the Pacific Ocean, quickly conquering much of the region.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The Axis advance was stopped in 1942 after the defeat of Japan in a series of naval battles and after defeats of European Axis troops in North Africa and, decisively, at Stalingrad. In 1943, with a series of German Defeats in Eastern Europe, the Allied Invasion of Facist Italy, and American victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded France, while the Soviet Union regained all territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The war in Europe ended with the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. The Japanese Navy was defeated by the United States, and invasion of the Japanese Archipelago (&quot;Home Islands&quot;) became imminent. The war in Asia ended on 15 August 1945 with the surrender of Japan.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The war ended with the total victory of the Allies over Germany and Japan in 1945. World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War, which would last for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers started to decline, while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery.

He decided to engage, despite having received a broadly accurate report from the German naval staff on 4 December outlining British activity in the River Plate area.

The British and New Zealander cruisers split up keeping about 15 mi (13 nmi; 24 km) from\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                .\n                <i>Ajax</i>\n                kept to the German\'s port and the\n                <i>Achilles</i>\n                to the starboard. At 09:15,\n                <i>Ajax</i>\n                recovered her aircraft. At 09:46, Harwood signalled to the\n                <i>Cumberland</i>\n                for reinforcement, and the Admiralty also ordered ships within 3,000 mi (2,600 nmi; 4,800 km) to proceed to the River Plate. At 10:05,\n                <i>Achilles</i>\n                had overestimated\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xb2s speed, and she came into range of the German guns.\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                turned and fired two three-gun salvoes with her foreguns.\n                <i>Achilles</i>\n                turned away under a smokescreen.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                According to Pope, at 11:03 a merchant ship was sighted close to\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                . After a few minutes,\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                called\n                <i>Ajax</i>\n                on W/T using both ships\' pre-war call-signs, with the signal: &quot;please pick up lifeboats of English steamer&quot;. The German call-sign was DTGS, confirming to Harwood that the pocket-battleship he had engaged was indeed\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                .\n                <i>Ajax</i>\n                did not reply but a little later the British flagship closed with SS\n                <i>Shakespeare</i>\n                with its lifeboats still hoisted and men still on board.\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                had fired a gun and ordered them to stop, but when they did not obey orders to leave the ship Langsdorff decided to continue on his way, and\n                <i>Shakespeare</i>\n                had a lucky escape. The shadowing continued for the rest of the day until 19:15, when\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                turned and opened fire on\n                <i>Ajax</i>\n                , which turned away under a smokescreen.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                It was now clear that\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                was entering the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Plate_Estuary" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">River Plate Estuary</a>\n                .

During the battle, a total of 108 men had been killed on both sides, including 36 on\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                .\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                entered Montevideo in\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">neutral</a>\n                Uruguay, dropping anchor at about 00:10 on 14 December.

Under Article 12, &quot;\n                <i>...belligerent war-ships are not permitted to remain in the ports, roadsteads, or territorial waters of the said Power for more than twenty-four hours...</i>\n                &quot;, modified by Article 14 &quot;\n                <i>A belligerent war-ship may not prolong its stay in a neutral port beyond the permissible time except on account of damage...</i>\n                &quot; British diplomats duly pressed for the speedy departure of the\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                . Also relevant was Article 16, of which part reads, &quot;\n                <i>A belligerent war-ship may not leave a neutral port or roadstead until twenty-four hours after the departure of a merchant ship flying the flag of its adversary.</i>\n                &quot;\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The Germans released 61 captive British merchant seamen who had been on board in accordance with their obligations.

After consultation with London, which was aware that there were no significant British naval forces in the area, Millington-Drake continued to openly demand that\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                leave. At the same time, the British secretly arranged for British and French merchant ships to steam from Montevideo at intervals of 24 hours, whether they had originally intended to do so or not, thus invoking Article 16. This kept\n                <i>Graf Spee</i>\n                in port and allowed more time for British forces to reach the area.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                At the same time, efforts were made by the British to feed false\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">intelligence</a>\n                to the Germans that an overwhelming British force was being assembled, including\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_H" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Force H</a>\n                (the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">aircraft carrier</a>\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal_(91)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  HMS\n                  <i>Ark Royal</i>\n                </a>\n                and the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlecruiser" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">battlecruiser</a>\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Renown_(1916)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  HMS\n                  <i>Renown</i>\n                </a>\n                ), when in fact only the heavy cruiser\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Cumberland_(57)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  HMS\n                  <i>Cumberland</i>\n                </a>\n                was nearby.\n                <i>Cumberland</i>\n                \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9done of the earlier\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_class_cruiser" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">County class cruisers</a>\n                \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dwas only a little more powerful than\n                <i>Exeter</i>\n                , with two more 8 in (200 mm) guns.

This strategy was deeply flawed because a U-boat, with its tiny silhouette, was always likely to spot the surface warships and submerge long before it was sighted. The carrier aircraft were little help. Although they could spot submarines on the surface, at this stage of the war they had no adequate weapons to attack them. Any submarine found by an aircraft was long gone by the time surface warships arrived. The hunting group strategy proved a disaster within days.

Although the narrow fjords gave U-boats little room for manoeuver, the concentration of British warships, troopships and supply ships provided countless opportunities for the U-boats to attack. Time and again, U-boat captains tracked British targets and fired, only to watch the ships sail on unharmed as the torpedoes exploded prematurely (due to the influence pistol), or hit and failed to explode (because of a faulty contact pistol), or ran beneath the target without exploding (due to the influence feature or depth control not working correctly). Not a single British warship was sunk by a U-boat in more than 20 attacks. As the news spread through the U-boat fleet, it began to undermine morale.

The Red Army managed to penetrate the Finnish defence line in Kollaa several times, thus pushing the Finns out of their positions but the Finns systematically counter-attacked to restore the integrity of their defence line. The Finnish defence came close to a collapse at the very end of the war - in fact, the Soviets managed to form a 0,5 - 1,5 kilometers deep fracture point into the Finnish defense line on March 12. As a result, the commander of the 12th division of the Finnish Army considered abandoning the main defence line at Kollaa, but as the news from the sector were that the situation was &quot;not yet that alarming&quot;, the commander ordered a counter-attack and the defence line to be retaken the following day.

The main resistance came from the Belgian 1st\n                <i>Chasseurs Ardennais</i>\n                along with the 5th French Light Cavalry Division (DLC). These forces had insufficient anti-tank capacity to block the surprisingly large number of German tanks they encountered and quickly gave way, withdrawing behind the Meuse. The German advance was greatly hampered by the sheer number of troops trying to force their way along the poor road network.

This huge armada had been allocated only four march routes through the Ardennes. The time-tables proved to be wildly optimistic and there was soon heavy congestion, beginning well over the Rhine to the east, which would last for almost two weeks. This made Army Group A very vulnerable to French air attacks, but these did not materialise. Although Gamelin was well aware of the situation, the French bomber force was far too weak to challenge German air superiority so close to the German border. The French had tried in vain to stem the flow of the German armour during the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Maastricht" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Battle of Maastricht</a>\n                , and failed with heavy losses.

Because of the danger the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                posed, movement over the rail network was limited to night-time, slowing the reinforcement, but the French felt no sense of urgency as they believed the build-up of German divisions would be correspondingly slow. The French Army did not conduct river crossings unless assured of heavy artillery support. While they were aware that the German tank and infantry formations were strong, they were confident in their strong fortifications and artillery superiority. However, the quality of the fighting men was dubious. The German advance forces reached the Meuse line late in the afternoon of 12 May. To allow each of the three armies of Army Group A to cross, three major bridgeheads were to be established at: Sedan in the south,\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montherm%C3%A9" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Montherm\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9</a>\n                to the northwest and\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinant" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Dinant</a>\n                further to the north. The first German units to arrive hardly had local numerical superiority; their already insufficient artillery support was further limited by an average supply of just 12 rounds per gun. Fortunately for the German divisions, the French artillery was also limited to a daily combat supply rate of 30 rounds per &quot;tube&quot; (gun).\n              </p>\n              <h5 style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                <span id="Battle_of_Sedan" class="mw-headline">\n                  <i>\n                    <b>Battle of Sedan</b>\n                  </i>\n                </span>\n              </h5>\n              <p>\n                At Sedan, the Meuse Line consisted of a strong defensive belt 6 km (3.7 mi) deep, laid out according to the modern principles of zone defence on slopes overlooking the Meuse valley and strengthened by 103\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker#Pillbox" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">pillboxes</a>\n                , manned by the 147th Fortress Infantry Regiment.

The French unit retreated, with just three remaining tanks. The 1st DCR was effectively destroyed on 17 May.

However, the success of his commanders on the ground began to have effects on Hitler who worried that the German advance was moving too fast. Halder recorded in his diary on 17 May that &quot;\n                <i>Fuhrer</i>\n                is terribly nervous. Frightened by his own success, he is afraid to take any chance and so would pull the reins on us ... [he] keeps worrying about the south flank. He rages and screams that we are on the way to ruin the whole campaign.&quot; Through deception and different interpretations of orders to stop from Hitler and von Kleist, the commanders on the ground were able to ignore Hitler\'s attempts to stop the northern advance to the sea.\n              </p>\n              <h5>\n                <span id="Low_French_morale" class="mw-headline">\n                  <i>\n                    <b>Low French morale</b>\n                  </i>\n                </span>\n                <span class="editsection">\n                  <a title="Edit Low French morale section" href="/wiki/World_War_II?action=edit&amp;section=21" shape="rect">\n                    <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" class="sprite edit-pencil"></img>\n                    Edit\n                  </a>\n                </span>\n              </h5>\n              <p>\n                The\n                <i>Panzerkorps</i>\n                now slowed their advance considerably and put themselves in a very vulnerable position.

After the war, Gamelin claimed his response was &quot;There is no longer any.&quot; Churchill described hearing this later as the single most shocking moment in his life. Churchill asked Gamelin where and when the general proposed to launch a counterattack against the flanks of the German bulge.

The Germans combined their fighting vehicles in major, operational formations and used them at the point of main effort. The bulk of French armour was scattered along the front in tiny formations. Most of the French reserve divisions had by now been committed. The 1st DCR had been wiped out when it had run out of fuel and the 3rd DCR had failed to take its opportunity to destroy the German bridgeheads at Sedan.

However on the evening of 19 May, French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud had dismissed Gamelin for his failure to contain the German offensive, and replaced him with\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxime_Weygand" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Maxime Weygand</a>\n                . Weygand had little sense of urgency. He claimed his first mission as Commander-in-Chief would be to get a good night\'s sleep. Weygand was guilty of wasting valuable time, time which was needed to form a quick and powerful counter-attack. He cancelled Gamelin\'s planned offensive, then wasted several days making courtesy visits to dignitaries in Paris. He then ordered a similar plan to Gamelin, proposing a counter-offensive from the north and south against the German &quot;corridor&quot;, which entailed a combined thrust by the encircled armies in the pocket and French forces on the Somme front (the newly-created French 3rd Army Group, under the command of General\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antoine-Marie-Beno%C3%AEt_Besson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Antoine-Marie-Beno\xc3\x83\xc2\xaet Besson</a>\n                ). The situation demanded an all-out offensive on the corridor.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                On 22 May, Weygand ordered his forces to pinch off the German armoured spearhead by combining attacks from the north and the south. On the map, this seemed like a feasible mission, as the corridor through which von Kleist\'s two\n                <i>Panzer Corps</i>\n                had moved to the coast was narrow. On paper, Weygand had sufficient forces to execute it: to the north were the three DLM and the BEF; to the south, was de Gaulle\'s 4th DCR. However, while the German position was far from safe, the opportunity had been lost. The delays had allowed the Germans to push more infantry divisions into the corridor and they had pushed further along the channel coast. Weygand flew into the pocket on 21 May and met General Billotte, commander of the First Army Group, and\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Leopold_III" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">King Leopold III</a>\n                of Belgium. The Belgian position on any offensive move was made clear by Leopold. As far as he was concerned, the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence.\n                <sup style="line-height: 1em; font-style: normal;" id="cite_ref-Bond_1990.2C_p._70_173-0" class="reference">\n                  <span style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; white-space: nowrap;"> </span>\n                </sup>\n                The King also made clear that in the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position in order to keep contact with the Belgian Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                Gort doubted the French Army\'s ability to prevail in the offensive. On 23 May, making matters worse, Billotte was killed in a\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_accident" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">road traffic accident</a>\n                , leaving the Allied First Army Group in the pocket leaderless for three days. Billotte was the only member of the Allied armies thoroughly informed on the Weygand plan\'s details. The same day, the British decided to evacuate from the Channel ports. In the event, communications broke down and only two minor offensives, by the British at\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arras,_France" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Arras</a>\n                on 21 May and the French at\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrai" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Cambrai</a>\n                on 22 May, would be acted upon.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                Major-General\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harold_Edward_Franklyn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Harold Edward Franklyn</a>\n                , commanding two tank battalions, had moved into the Arras area. Franklyn was not aware of a French push north toward Cambrai, and the French were unaware of a British attack heading south, out of the pocket, toward Arras. Ignorant as to the importance of the operation, Franklyn assumed he was to relieve the Allied garrison at Arras and to sever German communications in the immediate area. He did not therefore want to risk throwing his main units, the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">5th</a>\n                and\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">50th Infantry Divisions</a>\n                into the fight, especially if the objectives were limited. He also had the French 3rd DLM available, from the French 1st Army.

They were given no more than a flank protection role. Only two infantry battalions and two tank battalions were made available for the attack. British armour numbers had dwindled owing to mechanical failures. However they still fielded 74\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_tank" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Matilda tanks</a>\n                and 14 light tanks.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The resulting\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arras_(1940)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Battle of Arras</a>\n                achieved surprise and initial success against German forces which were stretched, but it still failed. Radio communication between tanks and infantry was poor and there was little combined arms coordination as practiced by the Germans. In the end, hastily set up German defences (including\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_FlaK_18/36/37/41" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  88 mm (3.46 in)\n                  <i>FlaK</i>\n                  guns\n                </a>\n                and\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_cm_leFH_18" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">105 mm (4.1 in) field guns</a>\n                ) stopped the attack. The French inflicted heavy losses on German armour as they retreated, but the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                broke up the counter-attacks. Just 28 of the 88 British tanks survived. The French V Corps\' attack at Cambrai also failed. V Corps had been too disorganised after previous fighting in Belgium to launch a serious effort.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                Although this attack was not part of any coordinated attempt to destroy the\n                <i>Panzerkorps</i>\n                , the German High Command panicked even more than Rommel. They thought that hundreds of Allied tanks were about to smash into their elite forces. It was unjustified panic.

Bock was busy and Halder agreed with Von Rundstedt and with von Kluge to stop action against Dunkirk. The disagreement went to Hitler, who overruled Brauchitsch and agreed with stopping action against Dunkirk. Hitler\'s error wasn\'t in making the command to halt the German army but in allowing the orders already drawn up by the German generals to stand. It appears that Kleist also agreed with the halt order, which Hitler &quot;rubber-stamped&quot;.

Its complement shrank to just 21 divisions, while Army Group A swelled to 70 divisions, including all ten Panzer Divisions. Army Group B was to be used as a &quot;hammer&quot; against Army Group A\'s &quot;anvil&quot;. Halder later claimed Hitler\'s motivation for the transfer was his wish that the decisive battle be fought on French, not Flemish soil.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Hermann G\xc3\x83\xc2\xb6ring</a>\n                convinced Hitler that the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                could prevent any evacuation and von Rundstedt warned him that any further effort by the armoured divisions would lead to a much longer refitting period. The delay and failure of the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                to stop the evacuation wasted some three days (24-27 May) and allowed the Allies to build a defence to the approaches of Dunkirk, the main evacuation port.

Once again, the German Army relied on the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                to help decisively, by silencing French guns and enabling the German infantry to inch forward. German progress was made only late on the third day of operations, finally forcing crossings. The French Air Force attempted to bomb them but failed.

In close-quarter combat, the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                was struggling to have an impact. However, in an operational sense, they helped disperse French armour. The German spearheads were overextended and vulnerable to counter strokes, but the concentration of the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                denied the French the ability to concentrate, and the fear of air attack negated their mass and mobile use by Weygand.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">\n                On 10 June, the French government declared Paris an\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_city" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">open city</a>\n                .

Weygand now asserted it would not take long for the French Army to disintegrate. On 13 June, Churchill attended a Allied Supreme War Council Meeting at\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tours" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Tours</a>\n                .

The French, meanwhile, had moved the French 2nd Army Group from the Alsace and Lorraine to the \'Weygand line\' on the Somme, leaving only small forces guarding the Maginot line. After Army Group B had begun its offensive against Paris and into Normandy, Army Groups A began its advance into the rear of the Maginot line.

On 15 June, the last well-equipped French forces, including the French 4th Army were preparing to leave as the Germans struck. The French now holding the line were skeletal. The Germans greatly outnumbered the French. They could call upon the I\n                <i>Armeekorps</i>\n                of seven divisions and 1,000 artillery pieces, although most were First World War vintage, and could not penetrate the thick armour of the fortresses. Only 88 mm guns could do the job, and 16 were allocated to the operation. To bolster this, 150 mm and eight railway batteries were also employed. The\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                deployed the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Air_Corps_(Germany)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  V\n                  <i>Fliegerkorps</i>\n                </a>\n                to give air support.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The battle was difficult and slow progress was made against strong French resistance. However, each fortress was overcome one by one. One fortress (\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouvrage_Schoenenbourg" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Schoenenbourg</a>\n                ) fired 15,802 75 mm rounds at attacking German infantry. It was the most heavily shelled of all the French positions. Nevertheless, its armour protected it from fatal damage. The same day\n                <i>Tiger</i>\n                was launched, Operation\n                <i>Kleiner B\xc3\x83\xe2\x82\xacr</i>\n                began.

It had 400 artillery pieces bolstered by heavy artillery and mortars. They drove the French 104th and 105th Divisions back into the Vosges Mountains on 17 June. However, on the same day Guderian\'s XIX\n                <i>Korps</i>\n                reached the Swiss border and the Maginot defences were cut off from the rest of France. Most units surrendered on 25 June, and the Germans claimed to have taken 500,000 prisoners. Some main fortresses continued the fight, despite appeals for surrender.

It was launched partly because Kesselring and Sperrle were not sure about what else to do, and partly because it gave German aircrews some training and a chance to probe the British defences. These battles off the coast tended to favour the Germans, whose bomber escorts massively outnumbered the convoy patrols. The need for constant patrols over the convoys put a severe strain on RAF pilots and machines. It cost fuel and engine hours and exhausted pilots. Eventually, ship losses became so great the British\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Admiralty</a>\n                cancelled all further convoys through the Channel. However, these early combat encounters provided both sides with experience. They also gave the first indications some aircraft, such as the Defiant and Bf 110, were not up to the intense dog-fighting that would characterise the battle.\n              </p>\n              <h4>\n                <span id="Main_Assault" class="mw-headline">\n                  <i>\n                    <b>Main Assault</b>\n                  </i>\n                </span>\n                <span class="editsection">\n                  <a title="Edit Main Assault section" href="/wiki/World_War_II?action=edit&amp;section=31" shape="rect">\n                    <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" class="sprite edit-pencil"></img>\n                    Edit\n                  </a>\n                </span>\n              </h4>\n              <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The main attack upon the RAF\'s defences was code-named\n                <i>Adlerangriff</i>\n                (&quot;Eagle Attack&quot;).\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                Poor weather delayed\n                <i>\n                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlertag" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Adlertag</a>\n                </i>\n                (&quot;Eagle Day&quot;) until 13 August 1940.

Three were briefly taken off the air but were back working within six hours. The raids appeared to show that British radars were difficult to knock out. The failure to mount follow-up attacks allowed the RAF to get the stations back on the air, and the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                neglected strikes on the supporting infrastructure, such as phone lines and power stations, which could have rendered the radars useless, even if the towers themselves (which were very difficult to destroy) remained intact.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                <i>Adlertag</i>\n                opened with a series of attacks, led again by\n                <i>Epro</i>\n                210, on coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, as well as \'satellite airfields\' (including\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Manston" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Manston</a>\n                and\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Hawkinge" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Hawkinge</a>\n                ). As the week drew on, the airfield attacks moved further inland, and repeated raids were made on the radar chain. 15 August was &quot;The Greatest Day&quot; when the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                mounted the largest number of sorties of the campaign.\n                <i>Luftflotte</i>\n                5 attacked the north of England. Believing Fighter Command strength to be concentrated in the south, raiding forces from\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Denmark</a>\n                and\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Norway</a>\n                ran into unexpectedly strong resistance. Inadequately escorted by Bf 110s, bombers were shot down in large numbers. North East England was attacked by 65 Heinkel 111s escorted by 34 Messerschmitt 110s, and RAF Great Driffield was attacked by 50 unescorted Junkers 88s. Out of 115 bombers and 35 fighters sent, 16 bombers and 7 fighters were destroyed. As a result of these casualties,\n                <i>Luftflotte</i>\n                5 did not appear in strength again in the campaign.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                18 August, which had the greatest number of casualties to both sides, has been dubbed &quot;\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardest_Day" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">The Hardest Day</a>\n                &quot;. Following the grinding battles of 18 August, exhaustion and the weather reduced operations for most of a week, allowing the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                to review their performance. &quot;The Hardest Day&quot; had sounded the end for the Ju 87 in the campaign. This veteran of\n                <i>Blitzkrieg</i>\n                was too vulnerable to fighters to operate over Britain, and to preserve the\n                <i>Stuka</i>\n                force, G\xc3\x83\xc2\xb6ring withdrew them from the fighting.

The Bf 110 proved too clumsy for dogfighting with single-engined fighters, and its participation was scaled back. It would only be used when range required it or when sufficient single-engined escort could not be provided for the bombers.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                G\xc3\x83\xc2\xb6ring made yet another fateful decision: to order more bomber escorts at the expense of free-hunting sweeps. To achieve this, the weight of the attack now fell on\n                <i>Luftflotte</i>\n                2, and the bulk of the Bf 109s in\n                <i>\n                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftflotte_3" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Luftflotte 3</a>\n                </i>\n                were transferred to Kesselring\'s command, reinforcing the fighter bases in the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pas-de-Calais" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Pas-de-Calais</a>\n                . Stripped of its fighters,\n                <i>Luftflotte 3</i>\n                would concentrate on the night bombing campaign.

It frequently switched from bombing one type of industry to another, and no sustained pressure was put on any one of them. Second, the Luftwaffe was not equipped to carry out a long-term strategic air campaign. It was not armed in depth, and its intelligence on British industry and capabilities was poor. All of these shortcomings denied the Luftwaffe the ability to make a strategic difference.\n              </p>\n              <h3 style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                <span id="Italian_conquest_of_British_Somaliland" class="mw-headline">\n                  <u>\n                    <b>Italian conquest of British Somaliland</b>\n                  </u>\n                </span>\n              </h3>\n              <p>\n                <br clear="none"></br>\n              </p>\n              <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The Italian force attacking British Somaliland in August 1940 was commanded by Lieutenant General\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Nasi" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Guglielmo Nasi</a>\n                , General Officer Commanding Eastern Sector.

This move would have a crucial effect on the outcome of the battle, since it would break the Greek supply lines and separate the Greek forces in Epirus from those in Macedonia. The Julia Division managed to cover 40 kilometres (25 mi) of mountain terrain in icy rain and captured the village of\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vovousa" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Vovousa</a>\n                , but couldn\'t reach Metsovo.

The commander of the Julia Division requested from the Italian headquarters relief attacks and Italian reserves were thrown into the battle. However, reinforcements from Albania were unable to reach the cut-off Italian forces and the Julia Division sustained heavy losses. In the meantime, Greek reinforcements were arriving in the Pindus sector, while the assistance of the local population, including men, women, and children, was invaluable. The situation became difficult for the Italians and their pocket came under pressure from Greek units that had advanced to the area, while the Julia Division was virtually wiped out.

The squadron would approach at dawn from the South West. Because the anchorage at Koh Chang was surrounded by islands and islets, many of which were over 200 metres high, the squadron would break up and use the cover of the islands to concentrate fire on portions of the Thai squadron whilst covering all the avenues of escape. The easternmost channel was regarded as the most likely route by which a breakout would be made \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d this was the most suitable route and was also the area in which the recce report had placed the largest Thai ships.\n                <i>Lamotte-Picquet</i>\n                would head to the eastern side of the anchorage to block this route whilst the colonial sloops blocked the centre and pounded the Thai ships there.

The effect of this mission was double edged \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d the French were now aware that they faced both the Thai units, but the element of surprise had been wasted and there was still thirty minutes to go until sunrise. Caught napping by the oncoming French the Thais desperately began to raise steam and prepared to slip their anchors, but the torpedo boats were sunk by gunfire from\n                <i>Lamotte-Picquet</i>\n                .\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                At 06:38, the lookouts in\n                <i>Lamotte-Picquet</i>\n                spotted the coastal defence ship\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTMS_Thonburi" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  HTMS\n                  <i>Thonburi</i>\n                </a>\n                , heading northwest, at a range of 10,000 metres (11,000 yd). A running battle ensued, with the fire of both ships frequently blocked by the towering islets. The fire from the Thai ship was heavy, but inaccurate. By 07:15, fires could be seen on\n                <i>Thonburi</i>\n                , which then found herself engaged not only by the cruiser but also by the sloops. In the beginning of the engagement, a lucky shot from\n                <i>Lamotte-Picquet</i>\n                killed the captain of\n                <i>Thonburi</i>\n                ,\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_ranks_of_the_Thai_armed_forces#Royal_Thai_Navy" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Commander</a>\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luang_Phrom_Viraphan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Luang Phrom Viraphan</a>\n                , and disrupted her operations. Believing they had a better chance of hurting the smaller French ships the Thais shifted their fire onto\n                <i>Admiral Charner</i>\n                , which soon found 8 in (200 mm) salvoes falling around her.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                <i>Thonburi</i>\n                shifted fire back to\n                <i>Lamotte-Picquet</i>\n                after a salvo from the French cruiser put her after turret out of action. Soon she reached the safety of shallow water which the French ships could not enter for fear of grounding, but it all came too late for the hapless Thais as\n                <i>Thonburi</i>\n                was burning fiercely and listing heavily to starboard. Her remaining turret was manned and hand and could not fire unless the maneuvers of the ship put it in appropriate position. At 07:50,\n                <i>Lamotte-Picquet</i>\n                fired a final salvo of torpedoes at 15,000 metres (16,000 yd), but lost sight of\n                <i>Thonburi</i>\n                behind an island from which she was not seen to emerge.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                For the next hour, the French ships patrolled the area, picking up survivors and ensuring their victory was total. At 08:40, B\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9renger ordered the squadron to head for home, but this coincided with the start of the expected Thai air attacks. Thai planes dropped several bombs close to\n                <i>Lamotte-Picquet</i>\n                and scored one hit, although the bomb failed to explode.\n                <i>Lamotte-Picquet</i>\n                <span style="padding-left: 0.1em;">\'</span>\n                s\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">anti-aircraft guns</a>\n                put up a vigorous barrage and further attacks were not pressed home.

They reached Mezzeh at 04.15. By 05.30, after an hour of fierce hand to hand fight, Mezzeh was captured. However, there was a major problem: the equipment and anti-tank guns travelling up the main road had earlier got ahead of the infantry and run into a Vichy roadblock where most of the vehicles were knocked out. Furthermore, the planned advance by the Free French to Qadim had been delayed so that the Vichy forces were able to concentrate on the Mezzeh action, applying intense pressure on the Allied position whilst thwarting any attempt to relieve them and bring in vitally needed anti-tank weapons.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                On 19 June,\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fullerton_Evetts" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Maj.-Gen.

But they could not blast a way through and they progressed only slowly against determined opposition from French tanks. A Free French attack on Qadim the previous night had failed expensively so that they were unable to exert pressure on Qadim that morning to draw Vichy forces away from Mezzeh. That night, however, the Free French with support from British anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns and an Australian machine-gun battalion, advanced against light Vichy defences and captured Qadim in the morning of 21 June.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                Through the night of 19\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d20 June, the Indian defenders at Mezzeh had continued to hold out. By 13.30 on 20 June, with ammunition exhausted and having had no rations for 50 hours, they were being shelled at point blank range. A decision was made to ask for a truce to evacuate the wounded, to try to buy time for the relieving column (which could be heard fighting in the distance) to reach them. However, the white flag was mis-read as a signal of surrender by the Vichy forces who rushed the positions of the remaining bayonet-wielding defenders and overpowered them. The relieving column, reinforced by a battalion of Australian infantry, recaptured Mezzeh at 19.00 that evening to find it empty save for the dead.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">By noon on 21 June, the Allied forces were in Damascus and the Vichy forces were retreating west along the Beirut road.</p>\n              <h3>\n                <span id="Battle_of_Beirut" class="mw-headline">\n                  <u>\n                    <b>Battle of Beirut</b>\n                  </u>\n                </span>\n                <span class="editsection">\n                  <a title="Edit Battle of Beirut section" href="/wiki/World_War_II?action=edit&amp;section=43" shape="rect">\n                    <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" class="sprite edit-pencil"></img>\n                    Edit\n                  </a>\n                </span>\n              </h3>\n              <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The\n                <b>Battle of Beirut</b>\n                (12 July 1941) marked the end of hostilities in the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria-Lebanon_campaign" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Syria-Lebanon campaign</a>\n                of\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">World War II</a>\n                .\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                On 8 July, even before the fall of\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Damour" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Damour</a>\n                , the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy_French" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Vichy French</a>\n                commander\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dGeneral\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Dentz" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Henri Dentz</a>\n                \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dhad sought an armistice: the advance on\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Beirut</a>\n                together with the Allied capture of\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Damascus" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Damascus</a>\n                in late June and the rapid advance of Allied troops into\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Syria</a>\n                from\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Iraq</a>\n                in early July to capture\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Deir_ez_Zor" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Deir ez Zor</a>\n                and then push on towards\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Aleppo</a>\n                had made the Vichy position untenable.

On the nights of 16/17 and 17/18 March, escorted engineers reconnoitered the road block and attempted to make a start to clear it. This failed because of interfering fire from the Italian lines.

For this Heath would need his full division and had to wait until 10th Brigade had refitted after its mauling on the Sanchil feature. The plan was for 10th Brigade to advance into the gorge whilst 9th Brigade (which was holding the Fort Dologorodoc positions) would move down to take three smaller hills overlooking the far end of the gorge and 29th Brigade would then attack to take Mount Zeban and beyond it to the east Mount Canabai, which looked down on Keren and guarded the road to Asmara.

Therefore, he wanted to reduce the range as quickly as possible. At a shorter range, the trajectory of\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                <span style="padding-left: 0.1em;">\'</span>\n                s shells would be flatter and they would be more likely to hit the sides of the ship rather than the decking, or to glance off the top deck. However, he closed the range at an angle that placed the German ships too far forward of the beam. This meant he could use only 10 of his capital ships\' 18 heavy guns while presenting the Germans more at which to aim than necessary. Those 10 guns became nine when a defect in one of\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                <span style="padding-left: 0.1em;">\'</span>\n                forward guns rendered it inoperative after the first salvo. Both\n                <i>Suffolk</i>\n                and\n                <i>Norfolk</i>\n                attempted to engage\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                during the action, but both were out of range and neither cruiser had a sufficient speed advantage over\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                to rapidly close the range during the brief engagement.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The Germans also had the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_gauge" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">weather gauge</a>\n                , meaning the British ships were steaming into the wind, spray drenching the lenses of\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                &quot;A&quot; turret\' 42 ft (13 m)\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barr_and_Stroud" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Barr and Stroud</a>\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_rangefinder" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">coincidence rangefinder</a>\n                and both British ships\' &quot;B&quot; turret 30 ft (9.1 m) rangefinders. This necessitated using smaller 15 ft (4.6 m) rangefinders in the director towers instead. In addition, Admiral Holland had\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                stay close to\n                <i>Hood</i>\n                , conforming to\n                <i>Hood</i>\n                <span style="padding-left: 0.1em;">\'</span>\n                s movements instead of varying course and speed. This made it easier for the Germans to find the range to both British ships, although it would have aided Holland\'s gunners if they had both fired upon\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                as originally planned, since they could then precisely time each other\'s salvos to avoid mistaking one ship\'s fire for the other.

She would ultimately hit\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                three times. One shot struck the commander\'s boat and put the seaplane catapult amidships out of action (the latter damage not being discovered until much later, during an attempt to fly off the ship\'s War Diary on the eve of her final battle). The second shell passed through the bow from one side to the other without exploding. The third struck the hull underwater and burst inside the ship, flooding a generator room and damaging the bulkhead to an adjoining boiler room, partially flooding it. These last hits two caused damage to\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                <span style="padding-left: 0.1em;">\'</span>\n                s machinery and medium flooding. More importantly, the damage to the bow cut access to the forward fuel tanks\' 1,000 long tons (1,000 t) of fuel oil. It also caused\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                to trail a visible oil slick and reduced her speed by 2 kn (2.3 mph; 3.7 km/h).\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                was soon listing 9\xc3\x82\xc2\xb0 to port and her bow lost 2 m (6.6 ft) of freeboard.\n              </p>\n              <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The Germans held fire until 05:55, when both German ships targeted\n                <i>Hood</i>\n                .

During the execution of that turn, a salvo from\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                , fired at a range of about 9 mi (7.8 nmi; 14 km), was seen by men aboard\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                to straddle\n                <i>Hood</i>\n                abreast her mainmast. It is likely that one 15 in (380 mm) shell struck somewhere between\n                <i>Hood</i>\n                <span style="padding-left: 0.1em;">\'</span>\n                s mainmast and &quot;X&quot; turret aft of the mast.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                This was immediately followed by a huge pillar of flame that shot upward like a giant blowtorch, in the vicinity of the mainmast. This was followed by an explosion that destroyed a large portion of the ship from amidships clear to the rear of &quot;Y&quot; turret. The ship broke into two. The stern broke away and sank. The bow, pointed upward and pivoting about, followed shortly thereafter. The forward turret did manage to fire one last salvo while upwards, possibly from the doomed gun crew, just before the bow section sank.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                Splinters rained down on\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                .5 mi (0.43 nmi; 0.80 km) away.\n                <i>Hood</i>\n                sank in about three minutes, taking 1,415 men, including Vice-Admiral Holland, with her. Only three of her crew (\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Briggs" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Ted Briggs</a>\n                , Bob Tilburn and Bill Dundas) survived to be rescued two hours later by the destroyer\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Electra_(H27)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  HMS\n                  <i>Electra</i>\n                </a>\n                .\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The British Admiralty later concluded that the most likely explanation for the loss of\n                <i>Hood</i>\n                was a penetration of her\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(artillery)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">magazines</a>\n                by a single 15 in (380 mm) shell from\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                , causing the subsequent catastrophic explosion. Recent research by submersible craft suggests that the initial explosion was in the after 4 in (100 mm) magazine and that it spread to the 15 in (380 mm) magazines via the ammunition trunks.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                It has been suggested from examination of the wreckage, found in 2001, that the magazine explosion in the 4 in (100 mm) armament near the mainmast caused the vertical blast of flame seen there, and this in turn ignited the magazines of the aft 15 in (380 mm) guns that caused the explosion that wrecked the stern. This explosion might have travelled through the starboard fuel tanks, igniting the fuel oil there, setting off the forward magazines and completing the destruction of the ship. The wreck of\n                <i>Hood</i>\n                revealed the bow section bereft of any structure and a huge section of its side is missing, from the \'A\' barbette to the foredeck. The midship section had its plates curled outward. Moreover, the main parts of the forward structure including the 600 long tons (610 t) conning tower were found about 1.1 km (0.59 nmi; 0.68 mi) away from the main wreckage. This has sparked theories that the 15 in (380 mm) forward magazines exploded as a result of the force, flames and pressure, caused by the detonation of the aft magazines. A team of marine forensic scientists has found that implosion damage to the forward hull due to the rapid sinking of the Hood, is the most likely cause of the state of the forward hull, and they do not support any theory that the forward magazines exploded.\n              </p>\n              <h4>\n                <span id="Prince_of_Wales_Alone" class="mw-headline">\n                  <i>\n                    <b>Prince of Wales Alone</b>\n                  </i>\n                </span>\n                <span class="editsection">\n                  <a title="Edit Prince of Wales Alone section" href="/wiki/World_War_II?action=edit&amp;section=59" shape="rect">\n                    <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" class="sprite edit-pencil"></img>\n                    Edit\n                  </a>\n                </span>\n              </h4>\n              <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                found herself steering towards the sinking\n                <i>Hood</i>\n                .

One shell passed through her upper\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstructure" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">superstructure</a>\n                , killing or wounding several crewmen in the Compass Platform and Air Defence Platform. Pieces of another shell struck her radar office aft, killing crewmen within. An 8 in (200 mm) shell from\n                <i>Prinz Eugen</i>\n                found its way to the propelling charge/round manipulation chamber below the aft 5.25 in (133 mm) gun turrets, and a 15 in (380 mm) shell from\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                hit underwater below the armour belt, and penetrated about 13 ft (4.0 m) into the ship\'s hull, about 25 ft (7.6 m) below the waterline, but was stopped by the anti-torpedo bulkhead. Fortunately for\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                , neither shell exploded, but she still suffered minor flooding and the loss of some fuel oil. Contrary to some mistaken opinion, the 15 in (380 mm) shell that struck\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                below the waterline did not endanger her magazines, as it came to rest abreast an auxiliary machinery room.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                By this time, serious gunnery malfunctions had caused intermittent problems with the main armament, leading to a 26% reduction in output. Captain Leach realised that continuing the action would risk losing\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                without inflicting further damage on the enemy. He therefore ordered the ship to make smoke and withdraw, \'pending a more favourable opportunity\'.\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                turned away just after 06:04, firing from her rear turret under local control until the turret suffered a jammed shell ring, cutting off the ammunition supply and making the guns inoperable. Despite efforts by crew members and civilian technicians to repair the shell ring, all four guns were not back in service until 08:25, although two of the four guns were serviceable by 07:20.This temporarily left only five 14 in (360 mm) guns operational, but nine of the ten were operational in five hours. The final salvos fired were ragged and are believed to have fallen short. She retired from the battle around 06:10. Thirteen of her crew were killed, nine wounded.

As commander of\n                <i>Bismarck</i>\n                , Lindemann operated first and foremost as a tactician. As such, he had no question about his ship\'s immediate objective to destroy\n                <i>Prince of Wales</i>\n                , and he had pressed his case as far and hard as he should. L\xc3\x83\xc5\x92tjens, as fleet chief and task force commander, operated at the strategic and operational levels. To some degree, his orders were clear \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d attacking convoys was his priority, not risking &quot;a major engagement for limited, and perhaps uncertain, goals.&quot; Nevertheless, Raeder had also ordered L\xc3\x83\xc5\x92tjens to be bold and imaginative, to accept battle if unavoidable and conduct it vigorously to the finish.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The bottom line was that L\xc3\x83\xc5\x92tjens\' orders did not cover a spectacular success like the one just achieved. His priority therefore was to stick to his instructions, focus on sinking merchant shipping and avoid encounters with enemy warships whenever possible. Moreover, before leaving Germany, L\xc3\x83\xc5\x92tjens had told Admirals Conrad Patzig and\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Marschall" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Wilhelm Marschall</a>\n                , that he would adhere to Raeder\'s directives. This meant he did not intend to become the third fleet chief to be relieved for contradicting Raeder\'s orders; Marschall, one of his two predecessors, had been relieved of command for not following his orders to the letter despite the fact that Marschall\'s analysis of the changes in the tactical situation since the orders were issued resulted in the sinking of the British aircraft carrier\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Glorious" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">\n                  HMS\n                  <i>Glorious</i>\n                </a>\n                and its two escorting destroyers.

Within weeks, the Italians were driven out of Greece and Greek forces pushed on to occupy much of southern Albania. In March 1941, a major Italian counterattack failed, and Germany was forced to come to the aid of its ally. Operation Marita began on 6 April 1941, with German troops invading Greece through Bulgaria in an effort to secure its southern flank. The combined Greek and British Commonwealth forces fought back with great tenacity, but were vastly outnumbered and out-gunned, and finally collapsed.\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Athens</a>\n                fell on 27 April, however the British managed to evacuate about 50,000 troops.

Martial law was declared in Moscow. Almost from the beginning of Operation Typhoon the weather had deteriorated. Temperatures fell while there was a continued rainfall, turning the unpaved road network\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasputitsa" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">into mud</a>\n                and steadily slowing the German advance on Moscow to as little as 2 mi (3.2 km) a day. The supply situation rapidly deteriorated. On 31 October, the German Army High Command ordered a halt to Operation Typhoon while the armies were re-organized. The pause gave the Soviets, who were in a far better supply situation, time to consolidate their positions and organize formations of newly activated reservists. In little over a month the Soviets organized eleven new armies which included 30 divisions of Siberian troops. These had been freed from the Soviet far east as\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sorge" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Soviet intelligence</a>\n                had assured Stalin there was no longer a threat from the Japanese.

Although the troops themselves were now able to advance again, there had been no delay allowed to improve the supply situation. Facing the Germans were the 5th, 16th, 30th, 43rd, 49th, and 50th Soviet armies. The Germans intended to let 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies cross the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Canal" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Moscow Canal</a>\n                and envelop Moscow from the northeast. 2nd Panzer Army would attack\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tula,_Russia" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Tula</a>\n                and then close in on Moscow from the south. As the Soviets reacted to the flanks, 4th Army would attack the center. In two weeks of desperate fighting, lacking sufficient fuel and ammunition, the Germans slowly crept towards Moscow. However, in the south, 2nd Panzer Army was being blocked. On 22 November, Soviet Siberian units augmented with the 49th and 50th Soviet Armies attacked the 2nd Panzer Army and inflicted a shocking defeat on the Germans. However, 4th Panzer Army pushed the Soviet 16th Army back and succeeded in crossing the Moscow canal and began the encirclement.\n              </p>\n              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">\n                On 2 December, part of the 258th Infantry Division advanced to within 15 mi (24 km) of Moscow, and could see the spires of the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Kremlin</a>\n                , but by then the first blizzards of the winter began.

Frostbite and disease caused more casualties than combat, and dead and wounded had already reached 155,000 in three weeks. Some divisions were now at 50% strength. The bitter cold also caused severe problems for their guns and equipment, and weather conditions grounded the\n                <i>Luftwaffe</i>\n                . Newly built-up Soviet units near Moscow now numbered over 500,000 men, and on 5 December, they launched a massive counterattack which pushed the Germans back over 200 mi (320 km). The invasion of the USSR eventually cost the German Army over 250,000 dead and 500,000 wounded, the majority of whom became casualties after 1 October and an unknown number of Axis casualties such as Hungarians, Romanians and Waffen SS troops as well as co-belligerent Finns.\n              </p>\n              <h5>\n                <span id="Battle_of_Moscow" class="mw-headline">\n                  <b>Battle of Moscow</b>\n                </span>\n                <span class="editsection">\n                  <a title="Edit Battle of Moscow section" href="/wiki/World_War_II?action=edit&amp;section=71" shape="rect">\n                    <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" class="sprite edit-pencil"></img>\n                    Edit\n                  </a>\n                </span>\n              </h5>\n              <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">\n                The\n                <b>Battle of Moscow</b>\n                (\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Russian</a>\n                : \xc3\x90\xe2\x80\x98\xc3\x90\xc5\xbe\xc3\x91\xe2\x80\x9a\xc3\x90\xc2\xb2\xc3\x90\xc2\xb0 \xc3\x90\xc2\xbf\xc3\x90\xc5\xb8\xc3\x90\xc5\xbd \xc3\x90\xc5\x93\xc3\x90\xc5\xb8\xc3\x91\xef\xbf\xbd\xc3\x90\xc2\xba\xc3\x90\xc2\xb2\xc3\x90\xc5\xb8\xc3\x90\xc2\xb9,\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Romanized</a>\n                :\n                <i>Bitva pod Moskvoy</i>\n                ,\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">German</a>\n                :\n                <i>Schlacht um Moskau</i>\n                ) is the name given by Soviet historians to two periods of strategically significant fighting on a 600 km (370 mi) sector of the\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">Eastern Front</a>\n                during\n                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" class="external exitstitial" shape="rect">World War II</a>\n                .
