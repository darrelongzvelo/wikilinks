Sadan Adanali – Aman Adanali, a Turkish folk song on 78 rpm record

Aman Adanali

Here is a record found in a box of 78s I bought in a flea market near my place a few months ago. “
Aman Adanali ” ( AmanÂ AdanalÄ± Â in Turkish) is a well known anonymous folk song in
Turkey,Â as evidenced by the numerous old and modernÂ  versions Â that can be found on
Youtube.

This one was performed by the singer and actor Sadan Adanali ( Åžadan AdanalÄ± ). The
unique source I found about him online isÂ  this website Â (in Turkish) run by his son A.
Korhan Adanali.

Sadan Adanali

Adanali was born in 1924 in Adana, in the south of Turkey, and died in 2002. Parallel to his
career as a theatre and movie actor, he made several recordings for Columbia Turkey (more
information about the history of recorded Turkish music inÂ  this article ).

“Kirli El” movie poster, starring Sadan Adanali

According to his son, who kindly answered my questions, the song was recorded by Sadan Adanali
between 1950 and 1952. The lyrics were explained to me by a user of Youtube and a member ofÂ 
this forum Â (with extra comments by my Turkish hairdresser down my street !). To make a long
story short,Â  Aman AdanaliÂ  tells the story of a girl in love with a boy from Adana…

Francesco Martinelli, a member of the 78-L mailing list, sent me afterwardsÂ a complete
translation of the song. Mr Martinelli is a specialist of jazz and improvised music, he’s
also the director ofÂ the Jazz Research Center at theÂ  SienaÂ Jazz Foundation
Â (you’ll find more information about himÂ  here ). It turns out that Francesco
Martinelli also has a strong interest in Turkish and Greek music,Â writes about them and is
in fact currently teachingÂ in Turkey.Â According to him, Aman Adanali is based on
aÂ  karsilama Â rhythm, a festive-wedding dance tempo. He also drew my attention to the
fact that different versions of this song were available on Youtube, the most recent ones
having lighter lyrics.Â You also can find anÂ  adaptation in Greek , andÂ  another
version Â sung by a Turkish singer who used to work in the New York Greek nightclubsÂ Emin
Gunduz, where the word Â  Atinali Â (from Athens) is used instead ofÂ  Adanali
Â (from Adana).Â It is interesting to note that this version seems to raise nationalist
reactions among Turks and Greeks in the comments…

To conclude this post, I announce you that I was contacted a few weeks ago by a visitor, who
offered me to clean my recordings. This can be very useful sometimes because of their bad
condition. So let me thank Mr Al Quaglieri, a producer from New-York, who made a great job
restoring this song ! Writing this post was really a collaborative work as I received the help
of different persons. That’s really the good side of the internet !

Here are the lyrics of the song and the translation kindly provided by Mr Martinelli :

Adanaâ€™nÄ±n yollarÄ± taÅŸlÄ±k Â (The roads of Adana are of stone)

Yok cebimizde beÅŸ para harÃ§lÄ±k Â (I do not have five cents in my pocket)

Elden gitti kahpe de genÃ§lik Â (The bastard youth escaped from my hands)

AÄŸam Adana’lÄ± paÅŸam Adana’lÄ±Â  (My Lord is from Adana, my general is from
Adana)

PeÅŸtemalÄ± pÃŒskÃŒllÃŒ peÅŸtemalÄ± sÃŒmbÃŒllÃŒ Â (The hamam

Here are the lyrics of a lighter version :

Adana’nÄ±n yollarÄ± taÅŸtan Â (The road to Adana is made of stone)

Aman sen Ã§Ä±kardÄ±n beni beni baÅŸtan Â (You came and seduced me)

Hem anadan hem kardaÅŸtan Â (Both from my mother and from my brother)

AÄŸam AdanalÄ± canÄ±m AdanalÄ± Â (My Lord is from Adana, my love is from Adana)

Ben sana yandÄ±m kibar delikanlÄ± Â (My love burns for you, my gentle young man)

Hey hey hey hey

Hey gÃŒllÃŒ hele hele gÃŒllÃŒ

Cosmos Elegy (ã‚³ã‚¹ãƒ¢ã‚¹ã�®æ‚²æ­Œ) A mysterious Japanese
waltz on 78 rpm record

29 Jan

Mitsuko Nemoto (æ ¹æœ¬çŸŽæŽ¥å­�) - Cosmos Elegy
(ã‚³ã‚¹ãƒ¢ã‚¹ã�®æ‚²æ­Œ)

I did my best but hardly found any information about this melancholic waltz from a Victor Japan
record…

With patience (and a very useful online dictionary), I managed to decipher the Japanese
characters on the label. Here is what I discovered :

The song is called “ Cosmos Elegy ”
(ã‚³ã‚¹ãƒ¢ã‚¹ã�®æ‚²æ­Œ,Â Cosmos referring in that case
to a flower ) and is performed by Mitsuko Nemoto (æ ¹æœ¬çŸŽæŽ¥å­�), with
lyrics byÂ  Saeki Takao (äœ�äŒ¯å­�å€«) and a music composed by Kobe
Michio (ç¥žæˆžé�“å€«).

Record's sleeve

The only reference I found online is this entry Â in the website of the Japanese National
Diet Library. According to this page, the record was published in 1932.

That’s all… Any extra information about this song or this singer would be really
appreciated ! Any experts of old Japanese music among you ?

Here is the recording… I especially enjoy the voice’s melody and the melancholic
accordion, it sounds like a song from East-Europe !

The Golden Age of Soviet Jazz (2/2) : Alexander Tsfasman
(Ð�Ð»ÐµÐºÑ�Ð°ÐœÐŽÑ€ ÐŠÑ„Ð°Ñ�ÐŒÐ°Ðœ) on 78
rpm record

22 Jan

Image:
http://ceintsdebakelite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tsfasman1.jpg?w=300&h=300

Alexander Tsfasman (Ð�Ð»ÐµÐºÑ�Ð°ÐœÐŽÑ€
ÐŠÑ„Ð°Ñ�ÐŒÐ°Ðœ) - You returned again (Ð¢Ñ‹ Ð²ÐœÐŸÐ²ÑŒ
Ð²ÐµÑ€ÐœÑƒÐ»Ð°Ñ�ÑŒ)

The first part of this post focused on Leonid Utesov, who can be considered as the most popular
Soviet singer of the 30′s. This second part introduces the pianist and composerÂ 
Alexander Tsfasman Â (Ð�Ð»ÐµÐºÑ�Ð°ÐœÐŽÑ€
ÐŠÑ„Ð°Ñ�ÐŒÐ°Ðœ). Both of them are the most emblematic artists of The
Golden Age of Soviet Jazz, which reached its peak in the mid 30′s. But this period didn’t
last long.Â As explained before, the evolution of jazz in the USSR was closely linked to the
political context of the country, and ideological attacks towards jazz resumed in 1936. It
was the time of The Great Purge . Presented as symbols of cultural dissent, many jazzmen were
sent to forced labour camps or shot. However, both Utesov and Tsfasman remained relatively
immune to these attacks,Â probably thanks to their notoriety.

The links with western culture lied at the heart of critics towards jazz at that time. From this
perspective, it is interesting to compare Utesov and Tsfasman’s positioning. But let me
say first a few words about Alexander Tsfasman. Tsfasman was born in 1906 inÂ Zaporizhia
(Ukraine) and discovered jazz in the 20′s in Moscow, where he was studying at the Music
Conservatory. In 1926, he launched the first professional jazz band of the USSR, called the
“AMA Jazz Band”. The ensemble included a trumpet, a trombon, a drum, a banjo, a clarinet
and a sax, with Tsfasman on the piano. The AMA Jazz Band was the first orchestra in the country to
perform live on the radio, in 1927, and to publish a record, in 1928. This record consisted of
two tracks, Harry Warren ‘s “Seminola” and Vincent Youmans ‘s “Hallelujah!”.

Alexander Tsfasman (Ð�Ð»ÐµÐºÑ�Ð°ÐœÐŽÑ€
ÐŠÑ„Ð°Ñ�ÐŒÐ°Ðœ)

During the next two decades, Alexander Tsfasman was quite prolific and recorded around 140
records (you can find his complete discography here ). His works include popular musics like
foxtrot, tango, waltz, polka and rumba, as well as several pieces for classical orchestra. In
addition to his activities with his band, Tsfasman also gave regular solo piano concerts and
composed for the cinema.

While Utesov was a popular showman, Tsfasman played a more sophisticated music, strongly
influenced by American jazz. Each of them actually embodies a different relation with
foreign and Soviet cultures. Stephen F. Starr, about whom I wrote in my previous post,
highlights two major opposite tendencies towards foreign culture in the USSR :
“adoption” and “adaptation”. “Adoption” is defended by those who think that
many aspects of foreign culture can be suitable to the country. “Adaptation” insists on
the specifity of Soviet culture and the necessity of “transforming” each foreign
influence to make it suitable. According to Starr, “ Tsfasman was the adopter and the
cosmopolitan, Utesov was the adapter and the nationalist “.

In 1938, Tsfasman became the director of the new foundedÂ All-Union Radio Commitee’s
Jazz Orchestra, with which he gave several concerts during the War for the Red Army soldiers at
the front. He kept performing a few years in post-war euphoria with the Hermitage Theater’s
band. But his career declined in the late 40′s, as jazz was once again the victim of
ideological attacks with the beginning of the Cold War and the development of Zhdanov
Doctrine.Â For a very detailed history of Soviet jazz, I really suggest you read Mr
Starr’s brilliant essay, which gives a very precise overview of the intellectual debates
around it.

This song called “You returned again” ( Ð¢Ñ‹ Ð²ÐœÐŸÐ²ÑŒ
Ð²ÐµÑ€ÐœÑƒÐ»Ð°Ñ�ÑŒ ) features tenor singerÂ  IvanÂ Shmelev
Â (Ð˜Ð²Ð°Ðœ ÐšÐŒÐµÐ»Ñ‘Ð²)Â and wasÂ composed and
conducted by Tsfasman, with lyrics by
SamuilÂ BolotinÂ (Ð¡Ð°ÐŒÑƒÐžÐ»Â Ð‘ÐŸÑ€ÐžÑ�ÐŸÐ²ÐžÑ‡Â Ð‘ÐŸÐ»ÐŸÑ‚ÐžÐœ).Â The
record was published in 1945 byÂ  Aprelevka Plant
Â (Ð�Ð¿Ñ€ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ²Ñ�ÐºÐžÐ¹
Ð·Ð°Ð²ÐŸÐŽ)Â label.

The golden age of Soviet Jazz (1/2) : Leonid Utesov (Ð›ÐµÐŸÐœÐžÐŽ
Ð£Ñ‚Ñ‘Ñ�ÐŸÐ²) on 78 rpm record

18 Dec

Leonid Utesov (Ð›ÐµÐŸÐœÐžÐŽ Ð£Ñ‚Ñ‘Ñ�ÐŸÐ²) - My dear
Muscovites (Ð”ÐŸÑ€ÐŸÐ³ÐžÐµ ÐŒÐŸÐž
ÐŒÐŸÑ�ÐºÐ²ÐžÑ‡Ðž)

You might remember that I posted a few weeks ago this unexpected Russian version of La
Cucaracha and wrote about the funny way I managed to find some 78 rpm records in Armenia. Here
are two other interesting recordings from the late 40′s…

To be honest, I didn’t know anything about music of USSR before putting these mysterious
records on my turntable. I must also confess I was really surprised to discover that this kind
of “light music” existed under Stalin…Â Listening to these jazzy tracks aroused my
curiosity andÂ I decided to do some researchÂ about the musical life in the USSR.
Thats’s how I found a very interesting book dedicated to the history of Soviet jazz,Â  Red
& Hot – The fate of jazz in the Soviet Union , written by American historian and jazz
musicianÂ  StephenÂ Frederick Starr Â (French readers might appreciate its nice
cover by cartoonist SempÃ© ).

Stephen Frederick Starr - Red & Hot

The purpose of this post is not to make a complete summary of Mr. Starr’s essay, which can
furthermore be consulted here . I still would like to introduce a bit the historical
background of these two recordings. While reading this book, I discovered, indeed, that the
development of jazz in the USSR was deeply linked to the political and ideological context and
strongly reflected the perception of America overtime in this socialist country.

Jazz was first introduced in Russia in 1922 by the avant-garde poet Valentin Parnakh , who had
discovered this music a few years before in Paris. Back in Moscow, he formed the so-called “
First eccentric orchestra of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic – Valentin
Parnakh’s jazz band “. This new music style didn’t meet a large audience first, as Jazz
was only known among elitist circles. The first popular success came with the live
performance of Parnakh’s band in Vsevolod Meyerhold ‘s theater play “ The Magnanimous
Cuckold “. But the real enthusiasm for jazz followed the tours in USSR of American bands Sam
Wooding and The Chocolate Kiddies Â and Benny Peyton’s Jazz Kings Â in 1926.

Valentin Parnakh's jazz band

Unlike many western countries at that time, The Soviet Union was firstÂ relatively
tolerant towards jazz. It didn’t last. The rise of Stalin after Lenin’s death in 1924 led
to a period of restrictions in the field of culture in the late 20′s. In this context, jazz
became the target of ideological attacks. In april 1928, the writter Maxime Gorki published
in the famous newspaper Pravda an essay called “ On the music of the gross “, in which jazz
was described as an “ insulting chaos of insanity ” and, through dance and erotism, as a
symbol of degenerate capitalism. These arguments were echoed by the powerful “
Association of proletarian musicians “, which was leading the campaign against jazz,
considered as a “non-proletarian” music. The consequences were immediate : playing and
listening to jazz were theoreticallyÂ prohibited, as well as importing and selling jazz
records.

Despite these measures, jazz remained popular, as theÂ Association of proletarian
musicians was totally unable to propose any quality alternatives. In 1932, after a period of
critics, jazz was finallyÂ rehabilitated. Its success was meteoric and jazz bands
flourished in the whole country. This period can be considered as the golden age of Soviet
Jazz.

Leonid Utesov Â (Ð›ÐµÐŸÐœÐžÐŽ Ð£Ñ‚Ñ‘Ñ�ÐŸÐ²)Â and
Alexander Tsfasman Â (Ð�Ð»ÐµÐºÑ�Ð°ÐœÐŽÑ€
ÐŠÑ„Ð°Ñ�ÐŒÐ°Ðœ)Â can be considered as the most emblematic artists
from this golden age. Utesov was born in Odessa in 1895 and began his career playing guitar and
violin and performing as a clown and an acrobat in a different circus troupes. In the years
before World War I, he started singing in bars, theaters and music halls in the south of Russia,
and then moved to former Petrograd (renamed Leningrad from 1924 to 1991). After a decade of
performance there, he had the chance to make a tour in Latvia in 1928, and then traveled to
Berlin and Paris, where he saw Mistinguett , Maurice Chevalier and JosÃ©phine Baker on
stage, as well as several American jazz bands.

Leonid Utesov (Ð›ÐµÐŸÐœÐžÐŽ Ð£Ñ‚Ñ‘Ñ�ÐŸÐ²)

Considering himself more as an actor than a musician, Utesov was a showman focusing mainly on
his impact on the audience. These bands he saw in Paris had a strong influence on him. Back in
Leningrad, he formed his own orchestra in 1929 with classical musicians and mixed jazz,
theatre and songs.Â His popularity was immediate and reached its peak in 1934 with
Utesov’s role in the first Soviet musical comedy “ Jolly Fellows “, in which he was
playing a jazz orchestra’s conductor. After that, he became one of the most beloved artist
in the USSR. This also meant that he had to make some compromises with the authorities. Utesov
and his band performed during World War II in the front lines for Soviet soldiers, they also
gave an open-air concert in Moscow on May 9th 1945 to celebrate the victory.

Jolly Fellows

Let’s talk about the record, now ! This song is called “ Ð”ÐŸÑ€ÐŸÐ³ÐžÐµ
ÐŒÐŸÐž ÐŒÐŸÑ�ÐºÐ²ÐžÑ‡Ðž ” (“ Dorogie moi moskvichi “),
which means “ My dear Muscovites “, and sounds quite typical of Utesov’s light style. It
was written in 1947 for the commemorationÂ Moscow’s 800th anniversary and performed by
Utesov and his wife Edit. Music was composed byÂ  Isaak Dunayevsky , with lyrics of Vladimir
Mass Â andÂ  MikhailÂ Chervinsky . The record was published by Aprelevka Plant
Â (Ð�Ð¿Ñ€ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ²Ñ�ÐºÐžÐ¹
Ð·Ð°Ð²ÐŸÐŽ)Â label.

You can also watch a live performance of this song here Â and enjoy Utesov’s talents as an
actor.Â A second post about Soviet jazz focusing on pianistÂ Alexander Tsfasman will
follow…

Update : This song was used in the 1982 filmÂ  The Pokrovsky Gate (
ÐŸÐŸÐºÑ€ÐŸÐ²Ñ�ÐºÐžÐµ Ð²ÐŸÑ€ÐŸÑ‚Ð° ), directed
byÂ Mikhail Kozakov (ÐœÐžÑ…Ð°ÐžÐ»
ÐœÐžÑ…Ð°Ð¹Ð»ÐŸÐ²ÐžÑ‡ ÐšÐŸÐ·Ð°ÐºÐŸÐ²). Many
thanks to Dondublon from Master Russian Forum for this information !

Orquesta TÃ­pica Bianco-Bachicha – Angustia (Tango) on 78 rpm record

Orquesta TÃ­pica Bianco-Bachicha - Angustia

Even though Buenos-Aires is the birthplace of Tango, Paris played a major role in the history
of this dance and musical style. To be more precise, Paris was one the place where Tango evolved
from a controversial subculture to a popular and “respectable” artistic movement.

Since its appearance in the second half of the 19th Century, Tango had suffered from a bad
reputation in Argentina, where it was associated with dirty suburban bars and brothels. This
image changed slowly in the early 20th Century, when the young upper-class society started to
accept Tango. This evolution took place partly in Paris.

A that time, Argentina’s economy was flourishing, thanks to agriculture, and rich
Argentinian landowners sometimes came to Paris to make business. They were often
accompanied by their sons, so that staying in Paris became more and more popular among young
Argentinian bourgeois. These daddy’s boys used to meet at night in the cabarets of Pigalle
and Montmartre, where they became famous for their elegant style and their propensity to
spend a lot of money. That’s why the expression “ riche comme un Argentin ” became
popular in France. Furthermore, this way of life raised a few critics in Paris, as this funny
testimony of a French journalist shows : “ There is a whole category of jealous Frenchmen who
do not love these Argentines, but we must also admit that there is a whole category of
Frenchwomen who adore them… ” (Taken from the book The Life, Music, and Times of Carlos
Gardel , by Simon Collier).

This Argentinian community wanted to listen to music from its own country. Attracted by this
diaspora, several Tango musicians left Argentina and moved to Paris during the so-called “
AnnÃ©es folles ” (“Mad years”) period, after the First World War.Â Whereas
dancing Tango was socially frowned upon in Argentina, this style was quickly adopted by these
Argentines in the cabarets of Paris, where they overcame social barriers and could
experience more freedom.

Una noche en "El GarrÃ³n"

A scene progressively emerged and organised around bandoneonist and composer Manuel
Pizarro , who arrived in France in the early 20′s. Several places became famous for their
Tango bands, such as “ Le Cabaret Princesse “, located rue Fontaine in Pigalle area, later
renamed “ El GarrÃ³n” (this club still exists today and is called “ Le Bus Palladium
“).

In this context, violonist Eduardo Bianco arrived in Paris in 1924, and formed with
bandoneonist Juan “Bachicha” Deambroggio the band Bianco-Bachicha. They were joined
by several musicians, like bandoneonist VÃ­ctor Lomuto and guitarist
HoracioÂ Pettorossi . This band became famous for its performances, which fitted
perfectly the tastes of the Parisian public, whereas it was almost unknown in Argentina,
according to this site .

Orquesta TÃ­pica Bianco-Bachicha

The “Orquesta TÃ­pica Bianco-Bachicha” splitted in 1928, Bianco and Bachicha led
their own career thereafter. There is a controversy about the role of Bianco during the Second
World War, as he performed in Berlin for Hitler and Goebbels in 1939. One of his song, called “
Plegaria “, was played by Jewish orchestras in the concentration camps and became the “
Tango of death ” ( Tango de la Muerte) .

Concerning Tango and the links between Argentina and France, I should also mention Carlos
Gardel and the controversy about his birthplace (Toulouse, in France, or TacuarembÃ³, in
Uruguay), but that’s another story !

Back to the record, now ! Angustia is a melancholic tango composed by HoracioÂ Pettorossi
and recorded in 1927 in Paris. This 78prm record was published by Odeon. If you like this band,
there is a sampler devoted to Bianco-Bachicha available on the French label FrÃ©meaux &
AssociÃ©s.

ZÃ© e Zilda – Olha o cÃŽco SinhÃ¡ (Samba) on 78 rpm record

ZÃ© e Zilda - Olha o cÃŽco SinhÃ¡

I bought this record a few days ago in a very nice place called “ La Phonogalerie “, a huge
shop devoted to phonographs and 78 rpm records located in the north of Paris, near Montmartre.

I found a few Brazilian records there, mostly samba songs of the early 50′s. My favourite
one, “Olha o cÃŽco SinhÃ¡” (Odeon Brazil), was performed in 1953 by ZÃ© e Zilda, a
duo composed of ZÃ© da Zilda (JosÃ© GonÃ§alves) and his wife Zilda do ZÃ© (Zilda
GonÃ§alves). I didn’t find much information about them in English, except this
biography of ZÃ© da Zilda on Allmusic.com. Portuguese-reading people can find more
details in this online encyclopedia devoted to Brazilian popular music.

ZÃ© e Zilda

ZÃ© e Zilda became famous in particular with their show onÂ Cruzeiro do Sul Radio in the
late 30′s. From 1943 to 1954, they have published 36 records on Victor, Continental and
Odeon labels.

Watanabe Hamako – Shina No Yoru (China night / She Ain’t Got No Yoyo) on 78 rpm record

26 Sep

Watanabe Hamako (æž¡èŸºã�¯ã�Ÿå­�) - Shina No Yoru
(æ”¯é‚£ã�®å€œ)

I listen to this record quite often, but I only discovered recently that this song called Shina
No Yoru (æ”¯é‚£ã�®å€œ, which means “China night”) had a special and
controversial story. It was actually not so easy to find out who was its original performer, so
that I had to make several researches to make this clear.

According to the information I found, this song was first performed in 1938 by Japanese singer
Watanabe Hamako Â  (æž¡èŸºã�¯ã�Ÿå­�, 1910-1999) and was used during
the Japanese occupation of China as the main theme of 1940 propaganda movie Shina No Yoru .

Watanabe Hamako (æ”¯é‚£ã�®å€œ)

There is also a cover version performed in 1941 by Japanese singer and actressÂ  Yoshiko
ÅŒtaka (å±±å�£æ·‘å­�, also known as Li XianglanÂ 
æ�ŽéŠ™å…° and Shirley Yamaguchi), who actually played the main role in the same
film (I told you it’s a bit complicated). According to this post and the comments I read on
Youtube, it seems that there is still a controversy concerning the identity of the original
performer.

Later on, the song became popular among American GI’s based in Japan and Korea after World
War II, and its hard to pronounce title became “She Ain’t Got No Yoyo”. You can easily
find anecdotes about it in Korean War veterans forums on the web.

The record was published by Columbia Japan
(ã‚³ãƒ­ãƒ ãƒ“ã‚¢ãƒ»ãƒ¬ã‚³ãƒŒãƒ‰). Lyrics
written by Yaso Saijo (è¥¿æ¢�å…«å��), music composed byÂ  Nobuyuki
Takeoka (ç«¹å²¡ä¿¡å¹ž).

You can read more information about this song and both singers in this post . Read also this
article written by Michael K. Bourdaghs from the University of Chicago.
