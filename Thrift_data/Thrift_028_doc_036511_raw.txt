This Day in Geek History: April 30



30 Apr 2012   Geek History



1006

Supernova SN 1006 , the brightest supernova in recorded history, occurs in the southern
constellation Lupus , near the star Beta Lupi . Chinese and Arabic astronomers note the
supernova, but the speed of the still-expanding shock wave won’t be measured for nearly a
millennium. The event is also recorded by observers in Egypt, Iraq, Italy, Japan, and
Switzerland. From the careful descriptions recorded by Chinese astronomers of how the light
varies, the Supernova is apparently yellow in color and visible for over a year.



1665

Samuel Pepys makes his first diary reference to the Great Plague in London . “Great fears of
the sicknesses here in the City, it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God
preserve us all.” The diary entries continue throughout the year, documenting the
terrible conditions in the city as many thousands die, until Winter’s freezing cold
reduces the number of fleas that spread the disease. The symptoms of the plague begin like
those of a bad cold. A high fever follows, with vomiting and painful black swellings, called
buboes appearing in the groin and under the armpits. His diaries will cover a period from
January 1660 to May 1669. In them, he will also write about the Great Fire of London in 1666.

1796

The first U.S. patent for a pill of any kind is issued to Samuel Lee, Jr., of Connecticut, for a
“Composition of bilious pills” which he markets as “Lee’s Windham Pills.” The
pills are highly popular for a long period. An 1803 advertisement for “Doctor Lee’s
Patent New-London Bilious Pills” will describe them as “Interesting to all sea-faring
People” and promise to cure a variety of ills, including “foul stomachs, where pukes are
indicated.”

1878

Louis Pasteur lectures at the French Academy of Science in support of his germ theory of
disease , in which he holds that many diseases are caused by tiny organisms. Pasteur also
describes ways to prevent infection, and provides skeptics with an experiment with which to
prove the theory to themselves.

1883

The Edison Electric Illuminating Co. is incorporated. It will later build the first
three-wire central station for incandescent lighting in the U.S.

1897

At the Royal Institution Friday Evening Discourse, Joseph John Thomson , first announces the
existence of what will later be known as electrons . Thomson tells the audience that earlier in
the year, he had made a surprising discovery. He had found a particle of matter a thousand times
smaller than the atom. He calls it a corpuscle, meaning “small body.” Although Thomson is
the director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge , and one of the most
respected scientists in Great Britain, the scientists present find the news difficult to
believe. They believe that the atom is the smallest and most indivisible part of matter in
existence. Nevertheless, the electron is historically the first elementary particle to be
discovered.

1935

The two millionth U.S. patent is granted to Joseph Ledwinka for a method of vehicle wheel
construction.

1938

The cartoon short Porky’s Hare Hunt debuts in movie theaters, introducing Bugs Bunny .

1939

Cosmic rays entering a Geiger-Mueller counter produce electrical impulses used to control
electrical power. The first ever such event is used for the illumination ceremony of the 1939
New York World’s Fair. The counter, at the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, switches on
an electrical circuit wired to a display at the Lagoon of Nations where relays activate local
battery circuits, ringing bells and flashing lights to signal each capture of a cosmic ray.
Guest speaker Albert Einstein explains cosmic rays. Unfortunately, his accent and a faulty
amplification system render his words incomprehensible to the crowd. Upon the tenth ray’s
signal, a huge light is meant to be turned on to illuminate the 600 foot Trylon triangular
spire, but the power source fails.

The RCA -owned NBC network launches regular public television service with the formal
opening of the 1939 New York World’s Fair by President Franklin Roosevelt . (It is the first
of only two appearances Roosevelt will make on television.) The service will air two hours of
programs a week, to be received on RCA sets, in order to “to make the art of television
available to the public.” By the end of the year, a thousand receivers will be sold in the U.S.
The screens of the receivers are initially only about five inches across.
