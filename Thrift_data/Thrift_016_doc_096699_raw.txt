Ft. Collins Aerial View Fifth most populous Colorado city

Fort Collins Â is aÂ  Home Rule Municipality Â situated on theÂ  Cache La Poudre
River Â along theÂ  Colorado Front Range , and is theÂ  county seat Â and most
populous city ofÂ  Larimer County ,Â  Colorado , United States . [ 4 ] Â Fort Collins is
located 57Â miles (92Â km)Â  north Â of theÂ  Colorado State Capitol
Â inÂ  Denver .Â 

With an estimated 2008 population of 136,509, it is theÂ  fifth most populous city Â in
Colorado. [ 5 ] Â Fort Collins is a large college town, home toÂ  Colorado State
University . It was namedÂ  Money Â magazine's Best Place to Live 2006 and #2 in 2008. [ 6 ]

History



Fort Collins was founded as a military outpost of theÂ  United States Army Â in 1864. It
succeeded a previous encampment, known asÂ  Camp Collins , on theÂ  Cache La Poudre River
, near present-dayÂ  Laporte . Camp Collins was erected during the Indian wars of the
mid-1860s to protect the Overland mail route that had been recently relocated through the
region. Travelers crossing the county on theÂ  Overland Trail Â would camp there, but a
flood destroyed the camp in June 1864. [ 7 ] Â 

Afterward, the commander of the fort wrote to the commandant of Fort Laramie in southeast
Wyoming, Colonel William O. Collins, suggesting that a site several miles further down the
Poudre would make a good location for the fort. The post was manned originally by two companies
of the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry and never had walls. [ 8 ]



Settlers began arriving in the vicinity of the fort nearly immediately. The fort was
decommissioned in 1867. The original fort site is now adjacent to the present historic "Old
Town" portion of the city. The first school and church opened in 1866, and the town was platted
in 1867. The civilian population of Fort Collins, led by local businessman Joseph Mason, led
an effort to relocate the county seat to Fort Collins from LaPorte, and they were successful in
1868. [ 8 ]

The city's first population boom came in 1872, with the establishment of an agricultural
colony. Hundreds of settlers arrived, developing lots just south of the original Old Town.
Tension between new settlers and earlier inhabitants led to political divisions in the new
town, which was incorporated in 1873. The first classes at the new state agricultural college
were held in 1870. [ 9 ]

The 1880s saw the construction of a number of elegant homes and commercial buildings and the
growth of a distinctive identity for Fort Collins. Stone quarrying, sugar beet farming, and
the slaughter of sheep were among the area's earliest industries. Beet tops, an industry
supported by the College and its associated agricultural experiment station, proved to be an
excellent and abundant food for local sheep, [ 10 ] Â and by the early 1900s the area was being
referred to as the "Lamb feeding capital of the world." In 1901 the Great Western sugar
processing plant was built in the neighboring city of Loveland. [ 11 ]



Although the city was affected by theÂ  Great Depression Â and simultaneous drought, [
12 ] Â it nevertheless experienced slow and steady growth throughout the early part of the
twentieth century. [ 13 ] During the decade following World War II, the population doubled and
an era of economic prosperity occurred. Old buildings were razed to make way for new, modern
structures. Along with revitalization came many changes, including the closing of the Great
Western sugar factory in 1955, and a new city charter, adopting aÂ  council-manager
Â form of government in 1954. [ 14 ]

Similarly, Colorado State University's enrollment doubled during the 1960s, [ 15 ]
Â making it the city's primary economic force by the end of the century. Fort Collins gained
a reputation as a very conservative city in the twentieth century, with a prohibition of
alcoholic beverages, a contentious political issue in the town's early decades, [ 16 ]
Â being retained from the late 1890s until student activism helped bring it to an end in
1969. [ 15 ] Â During that same period, civil rights activism and anti-war disturbances
heightened tensions in the city, including the burning of several buildings on the CSU
campus. [ 17 ]

During the late 20th century, Fort Collins expanded rapidly to the south, adding new
development, including several regional malls. [ 17 ] Â Management of city growth
patterns became a political priority during the 1980s, as well as the revitalization of Fort
Collins' Old Town with the creation of a Downtown Development Authority. [ 18 ]



In 2006,Â  Money Â ranked Fort Collins as the best place to live in America, [ 19 ]
Â proclaiming that "great schools, low crime, good jobs in a high-tech economy and a
fantastic outdoor life make Fort Collins No. 1." Fort Collins continues to grow in population
at a measured pace, with competition from other development in northern Colorado, debate
over future growth patterns andÂ  town and gown Â relations emerging as dominant local
issues in the early 21st century.

In the spring of 2008, several scenes from the comedy filmÂ  The Overbrook Brothers
Â were shot in the city and surrounding areas.

Center 's local historical archives. [ 20 ]

Regional economic development partners include the City of Fort Collins Economic Health
OfficeÂ  [4] , Northern Colorado Economic Development CorporationÂ  [5] , Small
Business Development CenterÂ  [6] , and Rocky Mountain Innovation Initiative (RMI2) [7] .

Small businesses, entrepreneurship



Fort Collins is also home to many small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures. The Fort
Collins/Larimer Small Business Development Center has been a strong contributing force
Â  in helping small businesses in the area get started and become profitable. Another
factor in the entrepreneurial climate of Fort Collins is Colorado State University's
College of Business and its Entrepreneurship Center, which has spawned such ventures as
Optibrand, a unique method of tracking livestock with retinal scans, and Revolution Donuts,
a donut/pastry shop with a new approach - late night hours in addition to the usual morning
hours.

The Rocky Mountain Innovation Initiative (RMI2) helps northern Colorado entrepreneurs
turn great ideas into great businesses. They connect startup businesses with the resources
they need to turn their innovations into successful enterprises [8] .

Items and goods produced



Pharmaceuticals, electronic components and accessories, aircraft and parts, scientific
instruments, measuring and controlling instruments, radio and TV equipment, industrial
chemicals, engines, turbines, machinery, and communications equipment. Clean energy
technology is also produced in Fort Collins, including Smart Grid technology, biofuels, and
solar technology. [ 29 ]

Local incentive programs



The City of Fort Collins has established an economic development policy that allows the
rebate of use taxes paid by qualifying firms on qualifying equipment. On a case-by-case
basis, the county will consider negotiating financial incentives, giving up to a 50 percent
credit towards a company's personal property tax liability for up to four years.

The Northern Colorado Economic Development Corporation [9] Â supports existing
employers and recruits new ones to the city and region. It assists local companies to grow and
expand and, in partnership with Colorado State University, encourages technology transfer
to nurture local start-up companies. Fort Collins can negotiate with individual taxpayers
who have qualifying new business facilities an incentive payment equal to not more than the
amount of the increase in property tax liability over pre-enterprise zone levels; and a
refund of local sales taxes on purchases of equipment, machinery tools, or supplies used in
the taxpayer's business in the Enterprise Zone.

Innovative Programs



FortZED [10] is growing to be the worldâ€™s largest zero energy district. The FortZED
area encompasses the Downtown area of Fort Collins and the main campus of Colorado State
University.

FortZED is a set of active projects and initiatives, created by public-private
partnerships, which utilize Smart Grid and renewable energy technologies to achieve local
power generation and energy demand management. Federal, State, and local funding are making
the project a reality. The U.S. Department of Energy has contributed $6.3 million, the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs has contributed $778,000 while locally, private
companies and foundations have contributed nearly $8 million. Learn more [11]

Mason Corridor [12] is a five mile north-south byway with bus rapid transit within the city of
Fort Collins which extends from Cherry Street on the north to south of Harmony Road. The
corridor is centered along the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway property, located a few
hundred feet west of College Avenue (US 287).

Mason Corridor and the Mason Express or MAX, will provide the framework for future economic
development and serve as the foundation to encourage community partnerships, private
investment, active living, and attractive, urban lifestyles. The Mason Corridor is a
fundamental connection between the City, Colorado State University, and local business and
neighborhoods. Mason Corridor was recognized as a top â€œSmall Startsâ€� project
in 2007 by the Federal Transit Authority. $11.18 million in Federal funding to support Mason
Corridor development is in the Presidentâ€™s FY2009 budget.

UniverCity Connections [13] Â focuses on three of Fort Collinsâ€™ community
assets: Colorado State University, Downtown, and the Poudre River. UniverCity Connections
is an initiative of the Community Foundation of Northern Colorado [14] Â and serves as a
think tank for community vision and a neutral convener that creates community connections
necessary for ideas to evolve into positive change.

Transportation



Allegiant Air [ 30 ] Â offers regular passenger airplane service into the nearbyÂ  Fort
Collins / Loveland Airport .Â  Denver International Airport , which is 70Â miles
(110Â km) to the south, is served by nearly twenty airlines. Fort Collins can be approached
from Denver by car viaÂ  Interstate 25 .

Fort Collins' downtown streets form a grid with Interstate 25 running north and south on the
east side of the city.Â  U.S. Highway 287 Â becomes College Avenue inside the city and is
the busiest street; It runs north and south, effectively bisecting the city.

TheÂ  city bus Â  system , known as Transfort, [ 31 ] Â operates more than a dozen routes
throughout Fort Collins Monday through Saturday, except major holidays.

Taxi service is provided 24 hours a day by Shamrock Yellow Cab. [ 32 ]

Bicycling is a popular and viable means of transportation in Fort Collins. Just about the only
place you canâ€™t rideÂ is a 3.8-mile section of College Avenue (Highway 287)
between Harmony Road and Laurel Street (however riding on the adjacent sidewalk is not
prohibited by state law). There are more than 280Â miles (450Â km) of designated
bikeways in Fort Collins, including on street designated bike lanes, and the Spring Creek and
Poudre River Trails, both paved. Thereâ€™s also a dirt trail, the 5.8-mile (9.3Â km)
Foothills Trail, parallel to Horsetooth Reservoir from Dixon Reservoir north to Campeau
Open Space and Michaud Lane.

The Fort Collins Bicycle Library lends bicycles to visitors, students, and residents
looking to explore the City of Fort Collins. There are self guided tours from the "Bike the
Sites" collection, including a Brewery Tour, Environmental Learning Tour, and the Historic
Tour. The Bike Library is centrally located in the heart of downtown Fort Collins in Old Town
Square. Look for the Cafe Bicyclette [15] !

Fort Collins also once had aÂ  trolley service Â with three branches from the
intersection of Mountain and College Avenues. It was torn out after ceasing to be profitable
in 1951. Currently, the Mountain Avenue branch has been reconstructed and provides weekend
and holiday service.
