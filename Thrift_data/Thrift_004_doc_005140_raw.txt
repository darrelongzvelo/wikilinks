Homeschooling Schedule Fall 2012



September 20, 2012 by janedeau

Why do we even call it homeschooling at this point? I guess our home is still our base, the HQ of
her education, but this year, more than ever, Z is ranging out far and wide to meet her
educational needs. She is actually taking more classes outside of the house than in and I am
only teaching five of her seventeen subjects.

Seventeen? Really? Wow! How are we managing that? I don’t know! I have been really lucky
finding local resources that are a good fit for Z, especially her homeschooling school, which
is she going to two full days a week this year. This year she is doing more subjects but spending
less time on each of them. We will see how that works out.

Here they are:

Math: Holt Fuse Algebra app for the iPadÂ  – 3 x wk

Piano: private lesson -Â  1 x wk + practice -Â  3-4 x wk

History/Geography : Post Revolution stuff I’m cobbling together/ Around the World in 180
Days – 2x wk

Current Events: OnlineG3 – 1x wk + homewrk (With Z’s favorite teacher Headmistress
Guinevere.)

Reading: Right now we are reading The Great Gatsby and various poetry. After TGG we will start
on Master Pieces of Short Fiction from The Great Courses.

Language Arts: Another one that I am teaching, we are still using Michael Clay Thompson Word
within the Word, Advanced Academic Writing, Magic Lens, and Poetry - 2x wk

Odyssey of the Mind : a collaborative creative problem solving class she is taking at our local
homeschool school. – 1x wk

Model U.N. : another collaborative class at her homeschool school where the students are
doing hands-on/roleplaying learning about current events, international relations,
diplomacy and problem solving. – 1x wk

Naturalist Training: Her 3rd class at the homeschooling school. Described online as
teaching an awareness of the patterns of animal behavior and the key characteristics of
plants, maintaining a nature journal, creating a plant and animal census, participating in a
Hawk Watch, learning to use a variety of field guides, using a compass, making watercolors and
sketches, and drawing maps. – 1x wk

Writing Workshop: Her 4th class at the school. This is the same class she took last year where
the students made their own newspapers, wrote lots of poetry, participated in Nanowrimo, and
wrote and performed a 45min play. I don’t know what they are going to do this year but I expect
it will be great. – 1x wk

Biology: a high school class for homeschoolers. Most of it is stuff she already knows but it is
cool for her to have access to labs.- 1x wk + homewrk

French: private lessons – 1x wk +homewrk

Musical Theater: Z is finally getting to fulfill a dream she had since she was 3 or 4 to be in Les
Miserables. This is a local theater production for middle and high school students. – 1x wk

Circus Aerials: Z moved up to the advanced class this year. – 1x wk

Art: Another class I facilitate. We just do a lot of random projects. Zoe enjoys anything
hands-on. – 1x wk

Girl’s Choir: This is Z’s second year at Girl Choir. – 1x wk

Hebrew/Religious School: When we changed temples I moved Zoe back a year (she was grade
skipped) so that she (actually so I) would have another year to get ready for her Bat Mitzvah.
The verdict is still out on this new Temple. . . but I feel like we just need to stick with it. We
can’t keep changing communities this close to her Bat Mitzvah. – 2x wk

Don’t those classes look great?! Some of those might need to drop off in the Spring if, as I
fear, we over-scheduled ourselves.Â  But, even with all those classes, I have managed to
protect some free time for her every day. She uses it to write music or stories, read, swim,
design outfits, hang out with her friends, play, etc. She is a creative girl and she needs that
downtime to create, to be herself, find herself, create herself, etc. WP_SLIDESHOW_IMAGES =

A place in the sun



August 5, 2012 by janedeau

Hail to Camp – - – -

Hail to her colors true

Oh, cherished Camp – - – -

Our thought is all for you



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/history_img.jpg?w=300&h=142

Going to an all-girl camp that was founded in 1908 on the shore of a lake up in the mountainous
woods of the Northeast is like joining a sisterhood that stretches back over a hundred years
with very deep roots and wide far reaching branches, and also a little bit like joining a cult.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/camparts.jpg?w=300&h=142

There are ceremonies of initiation, with special handshakes and mythological stories. The
girls are inducted into one of two teams, which they will stay a member of for life. There is even
a totem animal, the turtle.

Every morning Z and her five cabin mates had Cabin Inspections, which they were graded on.
Besides the normal keeping the bathroom and cabin clean and tidy they had to make their beds
with square corners and line up their shoes using a straight edge. The girls traded off jobs
each day. Apparently lining up the shoes was the hardest thing. (I am going to have to make Zoe
demonstrate this for me, because I just don’t see how lining up shoes could be that
difficult.)

Actually, the one thing harder than lining up shoes were the warm-up laps at the beginning of
each daily swim. Zoe, who is spoiled by the crystal clear waters of our heated pool, found the
lake waters to be “gross” and “cold.” To warm the girls up they had to swim laps:
freestyle, backstroke, and breaststroke.



Image:
http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/directions_img.jpg?w=300&h=142

They built a lot of routine into camp life. The girls got up to the sound of a bugle horn at seven
a.m. every morning, except Sundays. After breakfast and inspections they all met in the Lodge
for assembly where they would sing camp songs, celebrate birthdays and listen to important
announcements.

Then they had three activities before lunch, two were assigned but the third was their own
choice. There is climbing tower, archery, camping skills, art and crafts, cooking, tennis,
volleyball, kickball, soccer, hiking, field hockey, mountain biking, and yoga to choose
from. Being on a lake there were also tons of waterfront sports like swimming, water-skiing,
sailing, canoeing, paddleboarding, taking rides on the sea wasp or jumping on the water
trampoline. Zoe’s favorites were the sea wasp, water trampoline, archery, and sailing.

After lunch in the lodge-like dining hall there was a built in rest hour. For the first half hour
the girls had to stay silent and on their bunks in their cabin, the second half they were allowed
to talk. Zoe seemed to treasure this time to read and write in her journal.

The afternoon had three more assigned activities, one of which was always swimming. Zoe is
such a strong swimmer now and she is brown as a little nut.

At quarter to five it is time for the counselors to get a break and go swimming and the girls all
run for the showers because there isn’t enough hot water for everyone. Zoe told me that only a
third of her showers had hot water. It was not something she complained too much about though.
Makes me wonder if she wasn’t really taking that many showersâ€Š



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/campregist.jpg?w=300&h=142

After supper was something different every night, like camp wide capture the flag, trivia
contests, the masquerade, crafts, canoeing out for a sunset ride. They also had their plays,
talent shows, and campfires.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_78891.jpg?w=300&h=200

Before the early taps the girls were all fed a bedtime snack of milk and cookies at the Milkline.
Zoe and the other youngest girls had Milkline at the Crow’s Nest overlooking the river.
Every night, somewhere not too far away on the lake, fireworks flashed and banged as the girls
tried to fall asleep in their lakeside cabins.

I chose this camp after much research. There were many camps where Zoe might flourish. Theatre
camp, French camp, music composition camp, math camp, science camp, CSI camp, circus camp and
more. But Zoe devotes a lot of time during the school year to those things and I wanted her to have
a different experience this summer. My main goal was for Zoe to experience independence, to
get outdoors, and to get a sense of and grow in her capabilities. I decided a traditional
outdoor camp was the place. This camp doesn’t have a state of the art gym or Olympic swimming
pool. It has a trees and a lake. Not only do they not have computers, they don’t allow them, or
cellphones or iPads, or anything that can get you online. The cabins aren’t
air-conditioned, the lake isn’t heated, and the music you hear you are making yourself. It
is life unplugged.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0870.jpg?w=300&h=200

One of the things I think this camp did extremely well was to create a sense of belongingÂ  and
camaraderie. The history is thick and palatable and it gives the girls the feeling that they
are joining something special. There are so many traditions, like signing the walls and
ceiling of the cabins, the pageant, songs with hand gestures, and the milkline . There was also
the experience of being at a camp where all the decision makers are girls, and all the winners
are girls. There was plenty of competition but Zoe said it was friendly, with a lot of fun being
had dressing up in your teams colors and cheering for your side. She also said that the losing
team didn’t feel bad because the whole thing was just too much fun. But it wasn’t all
lighthearted. Zoe pushed herself hard to qualify for and move up to higher levels in various
sports. She was testing herself, literally, proving she could tread water, work the tiller on
the sailboat, tie knots and light a campfire.

http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/camponekaphoto.jpg?w=300&h=142

As far as she could tell Zoe was the only PG girl, the only home schooled girl, the only geeky
girl, and the only Jewish girl. But this W.A.S.P.y sisterhood was more than welcoming. When we
came to pick her up on Saturday she took us on a tour of the camp and everywhere we went girls, her
age and older, and counselors were calling out “Zoe!”, “Hi Zoe!”
“Zoooooeeeee!” I asked, “How does everyone know you??” and she answered, with a
wink, “I’m kind of a big deal.” LOL! She was joking. Probably. She has gotten pretty good
at those pop-culture referencing one-liners.

She taught her cabin mates Pink Fluffy Unicorns and they taught her The Sprinkler and
Motorcycle Cat. She bonded with a geeky counselor from Britain over Doctor Who, Firefly, and
Buffy. She got a little homesick, especially when she and the other youngest girls spent the
night in an old creepy house on Lake Wallenpaupack the night the derecho storm blew through
Pennsylvania. The Spyglass house had no electricity, only a fireplace to offer a sense of
protection from the hair-raising thunder and lightning.

Zoe was happy to see us and come home after two weeks, but she already asked if she can go back for
three weeks next year. I’d love to send her and maybe that will be the best place for her to go,
year after year. But I can’t say for sure at this point. Summer is an exciting time to try new
things.Â  Or maybe it’s a time for traditions and seeing old friends.

Remember beside the campfire

Beneath the mountains blue

That you’re part of Camp – - – -

And it is part of you.

This was a triumph.



August 3, 2012 by janedeau

I guess everyone knew it was going to be harder for me when Zoe went to sleep-away summer camp for
two weeks than it was going to be for her. Not that Zoe isn’t adorably attached to me, we are
still as we have ever been, the closest companions. But going away on an exciting adventure is
fun and diverting in a way that being left behind usually isn’t. Except it was.

The initial five days were easy. Brian and I had our first alone-for-longer-than-a-weekend
vacationÂ  in years and years. We slept in every morning. We spent some part of each day
outside, hiking up to waterfalls, riding zip lines, or ski-dooing around the lake. Every
evening we ate and drank at a fine French restaurant. It was decadent.

And the next week, all alone during the day, my time was my own. I could go when and where I wanted,
eat where and when I wanted, watch British movies on Netflix, read, write, and nap. And that
felt even more decadent!

I was totally prepared to miss Zoe fiercely and painfully. Her summer camp doesn’t allow
cellphones or email. I thought I might only hear from her two or three times and, in between, I
would be worried and wondering if she was happy and safe. But her camp has this cool system where
I can send her an email and they print it out and give it to her and she hand writes me a letter and
they fax it to me. My dear girl sent me nine letters in two weeks. They were short but long enough
to let me know she was happy and having loads of fun. So there was nothing to worry about.

So, this little experiment of mine, has been a success, at least on my side, and by all accounts,
for Zoe as well. I decided to celebrate this last afternoon of my vacation with a slice of cake.
I’m not celebrating Zoe’s absence or her return, but the not small triumph of things
turning out better than you thought they would. WP_SLIDESHOW_IMAGES = { load:

Why you should take your son to see Brave:



July 6, 2012 by janedeau

1. If he grows up to be a writer he should watch movies written by women, movies with female
protagonists, and movies that tell women’s stories so that he will also be able to write
complex realistic female characters because that is just better writing.

2. If he grows up to be a video game designer he will be able to design games that have cross-over
appeal, tapping into a larger market, making games that are accessible to the other half of the
population, or at least people his games with females that are there for more than just their
T&A.

3. If he is a teacher or coach he will be able to understand his female students better. He will be
more comfortable and effective teaching to them.

4. If he is a manager he will see the value in hiring women and paying them equally to what he pays
men. He will create and uphold a professional environment where women are treated with
respect and given equal opportunities.

5. If he grows up and falls in love women won’t seem so mysterious. He will have some
understanding of what makes them tick. He will be more comfortable with her needs and
feelings, because they won’t be foreign. He will be a better husband.

6. If he has a daughter he can be more to her. She will feel like she can share her interests,
likes, loves, and feelings with him and he will be better able to advise, comfort and support
her. He can help her dream big and reach those dreams. He will be a better father.

7. The more accurate representations of females that he sees in the media the more he will see
women as real people, equals and peers. He will be able to be a more fully developed person and a
better man.

Seeing Brave wont accomplish all this, but it is a start. Here are some other movies I recommend
you watch with your son,the earlier you start the better:

Spirited Away by Miyazaki

Howl’s Moving Castle by Miyazaki

Ponyo by Miyazaki

Nausicca by Miyazaki

My Neighbor Totoro by Miyazaki

Kiki’s Delivery Service by Miyazaki

Pippi Longstocking

Coraline

The Secret of Nymh

Inkheart

Labyrinth

Whale Rider

Annie

Matilda

Beetlejuice

And when they get older pretty much anything by Joss Whedon.

You’ve Got a Friend in Pennsylvania



May 30, 2012 by janedeau

Yeah, it’s me. We are all moved into our new house and looking forward to visits from our
friends. I know the promise of spending time with me is enough of a reason to make the trip. But
Philadelphia has more to offer than my charm and wit.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_15402.jpg?w=225&h=300 -

Philadelphia has a wealth of history and historical sites. You could easily spend your days
learning about the American Revolution where it actually happened. We have the Liberty Bell ,
Betsey Ross’s House , Independence Hall , The Constitution Center , Elfreth’s Alley ,
Valley Forge , and many more sites of historical significance. -



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc_0086.jpg?w=300&h=200 -

Depending on when you come you might even get to experience a live action reenactment. They are
having them somewhere around here all the time. There is also areas of civil war history and
underground railroad history sites and reenactments. -



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_1571.jpg?w=300&h=225 -

Yep, Philadelphia really loves and appreciates it’s history. But we also have a pretty cool
modern city too. -



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_1537.jpg?w=225&h=300

This is the view from B’s homebase in the Comcast Building , the tallest building in the city.
I’m so jealous that he gets to work in the city and be near all the great shops and restaurants.
-



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_1538.jpg?w=300&h=225 -

Downtown Philly is great for sight seeing, especially if you like art and architecture. This
Swann Memorial Fountain symbolizes Philadelphia’s three major waterways, The Delaware,
The Schuykill and the Wissahickon. -

We also have Christ Church , City Hall , Eastern State Penitentiary and and many buildings by
Frank Furness . Here is more info about the architecture of Philadelphia. -



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0325.jpg?w=300&h=225 -

I love the old architecture of the city and surrounding areas. Building’s like this are
common place. -



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_1587.jpg?w=300&h=225

This was someone’s house. Now it is a Catholic Home for Children.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0098.jpg?w=300&h=225

An example of Victorian Architecture in Wyncote.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_1566.jpg?w=300&h=225 There
are several castle type buildings in the area. This one of Chestnut Hill College.

Here is a list of 19 Beautiful Castles in Pennsylvania , many of these are close to where I live.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0789.jpg?w=300&h=225

If you are also into art The Philadelphia Museum of Art is one of the largest art museums in the
United States.Â  Many great artists are represented; Monet, Picasso, Dali, Rubens,
Renoir, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cezanne, etc.

The museum also has sculpture, tapestries, and other decorative arts as well as the
second-largest collection of arms and armor in the United States.

For more art, you could visit the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts , The Barnes , and The Rodin
Museum .



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0616.jpg?w=300&h=225

It’s not Broadway but Philadelphia also has some great theaters , orchestras , and operas.
All the big name bands and the small “alt rock” groups come here too. It’s a great place to
catch a live show.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0548.jpg?w=300&h=225

Besides being home to the first public library , post office, savings bank, university , and
hospital in the United States, Philadelphia also had the first zoo . There is also an aquarium
(um… over the river in New Jersey, but close enough). For kids there is also the Please Touch
Museum .



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0674.jpg?w=300&h=225

For science lovers will love The Franklin Institute where Zoe and friend are pictured here,
riding inside a flight simulator. The Academy of Natural Sciences right down the boulevard
has collections containing more than 17 million specimens. There are several botanical
gardens and arboretums to visit, as well as sites along with rivers, like the Seaport Museum .

If you are looking for something a little more unusual Philadelphia has that too. One of my
favorites is the Mutter Museum which contains a collection of medical oddities. It is really
gross but quite unique.



Image:
http://www.davehousley.com/bhouse/backup/www.barrelhousemag.com/word/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/mutter-museum.jpg

Laurel Hills Cemetery is a huge, grand cemetery overlooking the Schuylkill River, with over
33,000 monuments. It is really an amazing place to visit.

Literature buffs would like The Edgar Allen Poe House , The Rosenbach Museum & Library (which
has the largest collection of the late, great Maurice Sendak’s illustrations and
manuscripts), and The Free Library , who’s Rare Book Department features a Charles Dickens
collections with first editions, personal letters, and Dickensâ€™s stuffed pet
raven, Grip.



Image: http://thatsenuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/easternstate1.jpg

The historic Eastern State Penitentiary is also open for tours and has an amazing Halloween
event.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0273.jpg?w=300&h=225

Other places of interest in the city are The Comcast Center, with it’s 2000 sqft television
screen, Chinatown , the Reading Terminal Market (a truly fantastic farmer’s market),
Rittenhouse Square and Franklin Square .



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0770.jpg?w=300&h=225

Philly is also fun for foodies. Every kind of food is represented, at every price point. Max
Brenner is a favorite of ours. It is a chocolate restaurant and that is a chocolate hamburger
with marshmallow mayo, raspberry ketchup, and white chocolate mustard and it is even better
tasting than it looks.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0727.jpg?w=300&h=225

If you know me then you know that my favorite place in Philadelphia is the Wissahickon Creek and
the parkland that surrounds it.

It is kinda of ridiculously cool. The path along it is called Forbidden Drive. It has a cave that
an early American mystic lived in. There is Devil’s Pool, Hermit’s Lane Bridge,
Lover’s Leap, Ma Rinker’s Rock, a 15ft sculpture of a Lenape Indian warrior, many
bridges, trails and ruins of old mills.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0870.jpg?w=225&h=300

Forbidden Drive



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0763.jpg?w=300&h=225

Devil’s Pool



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0245.jpg?w=225&h=300

I think it is so amazing that you can just be walking on a trail and come to something like this.
What is more amazing is that this huge wooded place is right in the city.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0289.jpg?w=225&h=300

In Philly you can be driving in the city or a close suburb and suddenly find yourself in a rural
scene, like a Revolution era barn, or a ruined structure of Wissahickon schist. Sometimes the
wildlife comes right up to your door, like these deer in the front yard of a suburban
neighborhood, or the red fox that was on our doorstep last night.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0047.jpg?w=300&h=225

Speaking of our doorstep, come inside Gnarlwood and let us entertain you. B loves cooking for
company and I love it when he does. You will too.



Image: http://janedeau.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/img_0890.jpg?w=300&h=225

Right outside the back door we have the Coop/Scoop where we serve food off the grill and ice
cream, as well the hot tub, and the pool. Come on in, the water is fine.
