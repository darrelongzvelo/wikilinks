 About the areas I serve:

Taunton is a city in Bristol County , Massachusetts, It is  the hub of the Greater Taunton
Area. As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 55,976. I call it the city that
seems like a town!

Taunton's nicknames are derived from its history. The nickname  Silver City is born of
Taunton's industrial past when companies such as F. B. Rogers/International Silver Co. as
well as Poole Silver and Reed & Barton produced silver goods throughout the city. Christmas
City is still evident each December with Christmas celebrations on the Taunton Green. The
name Taunton means "town (or city) on the river."

 History

Taunton was founded in 1637 by Elizabeth Pole, and officially incorporated as a town on
September 3, 1639. Most of the town's settlers were originally from Taunton, Somerset ,
England, which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of
Taunton's incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, in honor and love to
our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to bring us to this place, and
settling of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, in the midst of the heathen,
for a possession for ourselves and for our posterity after us. Prior to 1640, the Taunton area
was called Cohannet.

 Mayflower Hill Cemetery

The British founders of Taunton took possession of the land from the native Wampanoags. The
Taunton area was the site of battles (on its soil or the surrounding area) during various
conflicts, including King Philip's War and the American Revolution. Taunton was
re-incorporated as a city on May 11, 1864.

Once a great industrial city, the "Silver City " was home to many silversmithing operations,
including the Taunton Silversmiths , Reed & Barton, Poole Silver, and the F.B. Rogers Silver
Co./International Silver Co. Various other industries operated throughout the city into
the third quarter of the 20th century.

In October 2005, the nearby Whittenton Pond Dam threatened to fail following a week that
brought nine inches of rain to the city. Over 2,000 city residents were evacuatedand Mayor
Robert Nunes issued a State of Emergency. It is estimated that if the dam had failed, the Mill
River would have inundated the downtown area with up to six feet of water. In response,
Governor Mitt Romney ordered an immediate inspection of high-risk dams throughout the
Commonwealth. [

Taunton once included many surrounding towns, including Norton, Easton, Mansfield,
Dighton , Raynham, and Berkley. Possession of the latter is still noted by the naming of
Taunton Hill in Assonet, which is now North Main Street, a street that heads into Berkley Ma.

County Superior Courthouse with the Soper Fountain in the foreground.

The city has a Mayor-Council form of government. Taunton also has a School Committee and many
boards and commissions. As the seat of Bristol County, Taunton is home to the county's few
administrative offices and several of its courthouses, including the Bristol County
Superior Courthouse. The Massachusetts State Police's Troop D (Southeast District), 4th
Barracks, patrols Taunton and is located in Middleborough.

Taunton is a part of three separate state representative districts: Third Bristol (entirely
located in Taunton), Fifth Bristol (which includes Dighton, Somerset and part of Swansea),
and Twelfth Bristol (including all or parts of Freetown, Lakeville, Middleborough and New
Bedford). It is a part of the First Plymouth and Bristol state senate district, which also
includes the towns of Berkley, Bridgewater, Carver, Dighton, Marion, Middleborough,
Raynham and Wareham . On the national level, the town is part of Massachusetts Congressional
District 4, which is represented by Barney Frank. The state's senior (Class I) Senator is
Edward M. Kennedy, and the state's junior (Class II) Senator, up for re-election in 2008, is
John F. Kerry.

Politics

Taunton has been a hotbed area of local, state, and national American politics for centuries.
Many famous political or politically-controversial events occurred in Taunton's long
history. This town was the first in Colonial America where a women (Elizabeth Pole) was
credited with its founding. Robert Treat Paine was a long-time Taunton resident and a signer
of the Declaration of Independence and the first Attorney-General of Massachusetts. Part of
King Phillip's War was fought on Taunton's limits.

Former U.S. presidents, such as Presidents James K.Polk, William H.Taft, Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, gave campaign speeches in Taunton. The city's former Camp
Myles Standish during WWII was a prisoner-of-war camp, a welcoming area for about a million
U.S. and Allied soldiers; and a candidate site for the U.N. Headquarters, soon after the
military camp closed. Although the city hasn't been as much of a hotbed of politics as it once
was, it still continues to be a politically active region of Massachusetts.

Economy

Taunton economy has historically been based on silversmithing and shipbuilding. Reed &
Barton produced the 1996 Summer Olympics medals and exclusively-used silverware for the
White House. Also, the city produced the anchor for the USS Constitution . The nearby town of
Raynham produced the anchor for the Civil War-era ironclad USS Monitor .

Today, the city's economy has many emphases on semiconductor, silicon, and electronics
manufacturing. It is home to corporate headquarters of many leading corporations in various
industries. Currently, the city is trying to attract biotechnology research companies to
its industrial parks.

The city is serviced by a central public library, the Taunton Public Library, which opened in
1903 and has undergone several expansions and renovations since that time. Also of note is the
Old Colony Historical Society, which archives the city and region's past.

The Taunton Green is the name of the city square. Early in its history, "The Green" was used as a
training ground for militias in the American Revolution. Some say it was also the site of the
historic "Liberty & Union"/"Taunton" flag raising in 1774 by the Sons of Liberty, prior to the
American Revolution.In the 20th and 21st century, the city square was temporarily
transformed during the winter holiday season into a grand display of Christmas lights,
scenes, and extravagant events. This is where and how the city earned its unofficial nickname
in the surrounding areas as the "Christmas City."

"The Green" continues to provide a centralized location for city-wide Christmas
activities, other holidays, events, and parades for the citizens of Taunton. A waterfall can
sometimes be found at the center of the Taunton Green, although currently it is used only
rarely, possibly to defray maintenance costs.

Always to be seen flapping together in emblematic unison, the "Liberty & Union" flag and the
U.S. flag fly side-by-side on the flagpole at the city's center.

Media

Taunton is served by several publications including the Silver City Bulletin , The Taunton
Call , Brockton Enterprise , and the Taunton Daily Gazette . Regional papers of importance
such as the Boston Globe , Boston Herald , and Providence Journal , are also widely available.

Taunton has local cable television channels which include the Taunton Educational Network
(channel 9), Taunton Local Access (channel 15), and Taunton Municipal Network (channel 17).
Comcast's Taunton system carries all Providence and Boston stations as well and both markets
are available over-the-air. The two radio stations based in Taunton are WPEP 1570 AM and WSNE
93.3 FM, the latter of which primarily serves and has its studios in Providence.

Some of the major Internet providers in Taunton are Comcast, EarthLink, SBC Yahoo! Dial, and
Verizon. The Taunton Municipal Lighting Plant (TMLP), Taunton's electric company, is also
an Internet service provider for the city and its surrounding towns.

Healthcare and utilities

Taunton is home to the Morton Hospital and Medical Center.

Electricity is provided to residents by the Taunton Municipal Lighting Plant. Municipal
water and sewer also service the city.

 

    Transportation

Taunton is the central highway hub of southeastern Massachusetts. Much of the eastern part of
the state's major highways intersect and/or runs through the city, especially at its center.
US 44, MA 138, and MA 140 intersect at a square at Taunton's center, which is called the Taunton
Green. MA 140 is also accessible from the eastern neighborhood of the city, popularly
referred to as "East Taunton." Additionally, MA 24 and MA 140 intersect near East Taunton, and
it is at that junction that Route 140 ceases to be a 2-lane divided freeway from the south and
becomes a smaller state highway to the north. Interstate 495 runs through the northern
portion of Taunton, unofficially referred to as "North Taunton", and parallel to Myles
Standish Industrial Park, Taunton's main industrial park.

Various smaller routes run through other parts of the city. These include a small portion of MA
104, close to the Taunton-Raynham city limits, and MA 79, close to the
Taunton-Berkley-Lakeville (Plymouth County) city-town-county limits. Taunton is the
western terminus of MA 104. It merges into US 44 after entering the city.

Several freight rails pass through the city on their way towards Fall River, New Bedford and a
link-up with the line in Middleborough. There are plans being worked on to link up parts of this
rail with the Stoughton line of the MBTA commuter rail system to Boston. The Greater Attleboro
Taunton Regional Transit Authority, or GATRA , provides bus mass transit.

Taunton also has its own municipal airport, serving mostly smaller craft and occasional
commuter jets. The nearest airport with national airline service is at T.F. Green Airport in
Rhode Island, and the nearest international service is at Logan International Airport in
Boston.

The Assonet River is a major tributary of the Taunton River in southeastern Massachusetts in
the United States .

Image: /skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png The Assonet River, northeast of Fall
River, Massachusetts

The mouth of the river forms approximately between Winslow Point in Assonet, Massachusetts
and Conspiracy Island in Berkley, Massachusetts .

    At its mouth, the Assonet River also forms Hathaway Cove in Assonet. From this general
    location, it flows northeast between Assonet and Berkley, eventually forming
    Shepherd's Cove in Assonet on its eastern side. From here, the river turns more northward
    and forms the beautiful Assonet Bay, a large inland body of water. Assonet Bay branches in
    several directions:

    - To the north is the mouth of Stacy's Creek, which runs north and also separates Assonet
    from Berkley.

    

    - To the south, it forms Payne Cove. The south end of Payne Cove turns into a smaller river
    which runs into Mill Pond. Terry Brook picks up on the east side of Mill Pond.

    

    - To the east, Assonet Bay continues as the next portion of the Assonet River.

    



From this point, the river runs under Route 24 and into Assonet Village, where it becomes much
narrower and runs through the center of the Village. This portion of the river essentially
stops west of Mill Street in Assonet, where a dam has created a waterfall. On top of the dam, the
river continues to parallel Mill Street until Forge Road, where another dam divides the
river. This dam forms Forge Pond. On the northwest of Forge Pond is Quaker Brook. To the
northeast, the Assonet River continues until the tri-border of Assonet, Berkley, and
Lakeville . At this point, it becomes Cedar Swamp River.



[ edit ] History

The Assonet River is a major river of southeastern Massachusetts, along with the Taunton
River. Throughout the history of colonial and early America , the river provided the
necessary power for gristmills and sawmills, and later the Crystal Springs Bleachery. It
provided for a minor port, and is also a prime location for herring runs.

During the 18th century, the river played a part in the American Revolutionary War . British
ships travelled both it and the Taunton River when fighting in the colonies. Such attacks led
to the Battle of Freetown , as well as the burning of river-centered village centers.

During the 19th century, fishing and cargo ships regularly used the Assonet River to reach
their home port of Assonet, Massachusetts . From these ports on Water Street and South Main
Street were delivered products such as food , dairy , lobster , fish , lumber , and for a span of
time guns . The N. R. Davis Gun Factory, located on Water Street adjacent to the river, supplied
many weapons to forces in the Civil War .

In the 20th century, the river continued to see its share of action, but only briefly. The last
ship to sail from Assonet set out in 1902. Small bootlegging operations used the river
sporadically. The Green Dragon Tavern was torn down in the 1930s, and the Town of Freetown
constructed its bandstand on the riverside site, providing a wonderful greenspace. The gun
factory burned in 1925, and the bleachery followed suit in 1955, essentially bringing the
commercial life of the river to a close.

Assonet Bay Shores, a former summer community, is a peninsula formed by Assonet Bay, Payne
Cove, and Shepherd's Cove. It was first settled early in Assonet's history, with this major
development following in the early 1960s. Across Shepherd's Cove is an abundance of
higher-end homes, proving that the river has found new life as a beautiful backdrop for rural
life.

 Rehoboth:

 

It was incorporated in 1643 making it one of the earliest Massachusetts towns to be
incorporated. The Rehoboth Carpenter Family is among the founding families. When it first
became part of Plymouth colony, it included all of Seekonk , Massachusetts and East
Providence , Rhode Island , and parts of the nearby communities of Attleboro , North
Attleborough , Swansea and Somerset in Massachusetts, and Barrington , Bristol , Warren ,
Pawtucket , Cumberland , and Woonsocket , Rhode Island .

Among the earliest purchasers of the land that is now Rehoboth and nearby communities was the
Peck family, who came from nearby Hingham initially. Joseph Peck, the brother of Rev. Robert
Peck, the disaffected Puritan who had fled his Hingham, England , church after the crackdown
by Archbishop Laud, had purchased sizeable tracts of lands from the Native Americans. Peck's
son was fined fifty shillings for making continuous sexual advances toward the maid. [1] .
Peck died in Rehoboth in 1697. These tracts of land Peck willed to his son Samuel. The family
continued to live in the area through the twentieth century. Today's Pecks Corner in Rehoboth
is named for this early Puritan family. [2]

Through the years, due to cedings of land and incorporations of the neighboring communities,
Rehoboth has taken its present shape. The town was and still is a site of crossroads which help
to serve Taunton, Providence, Fall River and points to the north.

It is the site of Anawan Rock, where Captain Benjamin Church surrounded and captured Anawan, a
Wampanoag sachem and advisor to King Philip , and his men, effectively ending the campaigns in
Southeastern Massachusetts of King Philip's War . The Wampanoags had taken this position
above Squannakonk Swamp to hide from the colonists. (Although a desolate place at the time,
the rock itself is not far off modern-day Route 44 .)

Rehoboth also has a claim to one of the birthplaces of public education in North America . Upon
incorporation, the Newman Church in modern-day East Providence elected to support a teacher
for the congregation's children. Because of the lack of separation between church and state
at the time, Rehoboth claims one of the earliest known education systems in America. One of the
town's landmarks is also education related; the Hornbine School located in the southeast
corner of town was built in 1845 as one of the town's nine one-room schoolhouses.

Today Rehoboth is mostly a suburban community, with small historic sites dotting the
landscape. Although the population is increasing rapidly, Rehoboth is still considered a
rural community.

 Geography

According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 46.8  square miles
(121.1  km² ), of which, 46.5 square miles (120.4 km²) of it is land and 0.3 square
miles (0.7 km²) of it (0.60%) is water. Much of the land is hilly and swampy, with most of its
brooks and swamps feeding into the Palmer River, which empties out into Narragansett Bay to
the south. The town has a small state forest in the northeast corner, and two small
conservation areas: Borden Conservation Area near the center of town and Rehoboth
Conservation Area along the Palmer River in the south.

Rehoboth shares its entire western border with Seekonk. It is also bordered by Attleboro and
Norton to the north, Taunton and Dighton to the east, and Swansea to the south and southeast.
Rehoboth's localities are: Four Corners, Hornbine, Kingmans Corner, North Rehoboth, Pecks
Corner, Perrys Corner, Perryville, Rehoboth Village, South Rehoboth and Anawan Rock. The
town is located 11 miles east of Providence , Rhode Island and 50 miles southeast of Boston .

 Transportation

The town does not have many major routes. The longest state routes through town, U.S. Route 44
and Route 118 , intersect near the center of town. Route 6 and Interstate 195 run though the
southwest corner of town for approximately 0.7 and 1.5 miles, respectively. Exit 2 off I-195
(" Route 136 /Warren, R.I.-Newport, R.I.") is just south of where the interstate passes into
Swansea and can be reached by Kingsley Way (which also leads into Rte. 136).

Rehoboth is a part of the Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority (GATRA),
which provides bus service to towns in central Bristol and Plymouth counties. The nearest
rail service is in Attleboro, where there are two stops on the MBTA's Providence line. The
nearest local airport is in Taunton; the nearest national airport is T.F. Green Airport in
Rhode Island, less than 20 miles away; and the nearest international airport is Logan
International Airport in Boston, 53 miles away.

from 25 to 44, 28.2% from 45 to 64, and 10.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39
years. For every 100 females there were 98.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there
were 95.2 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $65,373, and the median income for a family was
$71,992. Males had a median income of $45,557 versus $32,445 for females. The per capita

the poverty line , including 2.7% of those under age 18 and 7.4% of those age 65 or over.

 Government

The town is part of the Fourth Bristol state representative district, including Seekonk and
parts of Swansea and Norton. In the state senate, the town is part of the Bristol and Norfolk
district, which includes part of the city of Attleboro and all or part of the towns of Dover,
Foxborough, Mansfield, Medfield, Norton, Seekonk, Sharon and Walpole. Rehoboth is
patrolled by Troop D (Southeast District), 4th Barracks (located in Middleborough) of the
Massachusetts State Police . On the national level, the town is part of Massachusetts's 3rd
congressional district , which is represented by Jim McGovern . The state's senior ( Class I )
Senator, John Kerry , and the state's junior (Class II) Senator, is Scott Brown .

The town is governed by an open town meeting run by a board of selectmen . The current board of
selectmen consists of 3 members. Currently, the three selectmen of Rehoboth are Frederick
"Skip" Vadnais, Brig. Gen. Kevin McBride,and Kenneth Foley. The town has a central police and
fire station, as well as branch fire stations in North and South Rehoboth. The Blanding
Library is located in the Goff Memorial Hall, also near the center of town

 Education

Rehoboth's educational system can be traced back to the earliest days of the town (see
"History" for more details). Today, it shares the Dighton-Rehoboth Regional School
District, formed in 1958 and expanded to include all schools in 1987, with its neighbor to the
east. The high school, Dighton-Rehoboth Regional High School, is located just across the
town line in North Dighton, and is a comprehensive high school, providing both college
preparatory and vocational-technical training. The town has two schools, the D. L. Beckwith
Middle School and the Palmer River Elementary School, both located on Winthrop Street (Rte.
44).

As a result of having a vocational-technical wing at the high school, Rehoboth has no direct
affiliations with any regional vocational schools; the closest are in Taunton and Fall
River. Students can, however, attend Bristol County Agricultural High School in Dighton.
The town is also home to one private school, the Cedar Brook Seventh-day Adventist School,
which is a K-8 school.

The athletics teams of Dighton-Rehoboth Regional High School (the "Falcons") participate
in the South Coast Conference ("SCC") of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic

Seekonk is a town in Bristol County , Massachusetts , United States , on the Rhode Island
border. It was incorporated in 1812 from the western half of Rehoboth . The population was
13,425 at the 2000 census .



History- Early years



The first inhabitants of Seekonk were Native Americans from the Wampanoag Tribe. The name
Wampanoag means People of the Morning Light. This name refers to the geographical area of the
tribe. Living in the East they would be the first people to greet the sun each morning. The area
now known as Seekonk and Rehoboth provided agricultural and water resources with abundant
food supplies. During the warm summer months the Natives spent time near the rivers and oceans
in what is now Southeastern Massachusetts. In the winter months the Natives lived inland,
including several locations in Seekonk. At one time there were three Native American
villages in the area we now call Seekonk.



There have been many spellings of the name Seekonk. Some of the various spellings include
Seconch, Sink Hunk, Secquncke, Seaconke, and Squannakonk. The symbol of the goose in flight
is used on the Town Seal. Chief Massasoit



The chief of the Wampanoags at the time the colonists settled in Southeastern Massachusetts
was known as Massasoit or Ossamequin. In English this name means yellow feather.
Ossamequin's people had been seriously affected by a plague just prior to the arrival of the
Pilgrims at Plymouth . A large number of Wampanoag Indians had been killed by this illness.
Most historians believe this plague to have been yellow fever .



Massasoit decided to make a peace treaty with the new immigrants for a number of reasons.
Perhaps the most important factor was that the Wampanoags were fearful of being overtaken by
the Narragansett Indians who lived nearby. Ossamequin believed an alliance with the English
would help to secure the safety of his people.



In 1641, the local Native Americans had granted a large part of modern-day Seekonk to
purchasers from Hingham, including Edward Gilman Sr., Joseph Peck, John Leavitt and others.
[1] In 1653 Ossamequin and his son Wamsetto, also known as Alexander to the English, signed a
deed granting the land that is now Seekonk and the surrounding communities to Thomas Willitt,
Myles Standish and Josiah Winslow.



The Wampanoags were paid 35 pounds sterling by the English settlers, for instance, for the
sale to Willitt, Standish and Winslow.



Three of the earliest English men to settle in the area now known as Seekonk and Providence were
William Blackstone , Roger Williams and Samuel Newman . These men and their followers proved
it was possible to provide a living away from the coastal areas. This allowed groups of
individuals to separate themselves from Puritan control. In turn this led to a greater
diversity of culture and religious and philosophical freedom. It was only by forming
alliances with the Native Americans in both the Wampanoag and Narragansett tribes that these
early settlements were able to flourish.



 King Philip's War



Massasoit lived until he was 80 years old. While he lived, his people and the settlers lived in
relative peace. He was followed in power by his son Wamsetto, also known as Alexander. This
chief died shortly after his father and was replaced by his brother Metacomet , also known as
King Philip.



In 1675, King Philip's War began and both sides saw this as an opportunity to claim the land for
their people and their way of life. Metacomet and his people ultimately lost the war, and the
chief was killed by a mixed group of English and Indian fighters led by Benjamin Church . He was
beheaded and his head stayed on public display on a pole in Plymouth for 25 years.



Incorporation to Today



For the next 200 years the area we now call Seekonk was primarily a farming community. Accounts
of Town Meetings during these years communicate just how contentious deciding what was best
for this area could be. Boundary disputes were common and the land that is now Rehoboth , East
Providence , Pawtucket and Seekonk was claimed by both Rhode Island and Massachusetts. In
1812 the border disputes were settled by the courts and the present town of Seekonk was
incorporated. Two industrial villages developed to supplement the agricultural economy,
with such businesses as the Rumford Chemical Works, but what had been the industrial area of
the town in the late 18th and early 19th century was lost when East Providence was incorporated
in 1862 taking half of the town's territory, two-thirds of its valuation and more than
two-thirds of its population. The town remained basically agricultural into the 20th
century, although the Kent Manufacturing Company did make tennis racquets and croquet sets
on the upper reaches of the Tenmile River. With the opening of the Providence and Taunton
street railway in 1891, Seekonk became increasingly a residential suburb of Providence.



Very few farms still exist in Seekonk. Developers have turned the farms into housing
divisions and Seekonk is used largely as a suburban home community for people who work in the
Rhode Island and Boston areas. It is now well known for its retail area along Route 6, which
includes a movie multiplex, many different chain stores and restaurants, as well as the
Seekonk Speedway, a "fast track" destination for ARC or auto racing club. Although there has
been a great deal of building in Seekonk since the Wampanoags first lived here you can still see
many of the "black" Canada geese which give the town its name.

According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 18.4 square miles
(47.7 km²), of which, 18.3 square miles (47.4 km²) of it is land and 0.1 square miles
(0.3 km²) of it is water. The total area is 0.54% water. It is bordered by Rehoboth to the
east, Barrington , Rhode Island and Swansea to the south, East Providence and Pawtucket ,
Rhode Island to the west, and Attleboro to the north. Much of the population is concentrated in
two areas; one, the Lebanon Mills and Perrins Crossing neighborhoods in the north, and the
other, the southern neighborhoods of Luthers Corners and South Seekonk, mostly located
between Interstate 195 and Route 44. Seekonk is just five miles east of Providence , Rhode
Island , and is 48 miles southwest of Boston .



The town has three golf courses (Ledgemont, Pawtucket and Firefly) and one playground.
Slater Memorial Park in Pawtucket lies just over the Seekonk line, next to Pawtucket Country
Club. The Town lies within two watershed areas, the Ten Mile River Watershed and the
Narragansett Bay Watershed.



Transportation



The town can be accessed through one interstate, I-195 , as well as Route 6 , Route 44 , Route 152

Dear Lori,

You are such a great agent and know your market, your neighborhood. When you said that
appraisal could be an issue, you were right about that, and when you said my home would sell
quickly when I priced it at market value, you were right about that too.  Under agreement in
less than a month and Sold in 60 days! Thanks Lori
