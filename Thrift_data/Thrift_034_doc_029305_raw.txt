Is the sun hollow?



Earlier today I took a couple minutes to visit SpaceWeather.com to see if there was anything
unusual happening overhead. After skimming over the text, I left the webpage up while I was
distracted with some other task. All the while, this picture of the sun sat on the screen.



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/magnificent_sunspots-300x136.jpg

A short while later I found myself looking at the picture asking myself â€“ why is there no
light coming from that â€˜spotâ€™ on the sun?

Take another look at that picture. It looks almost organic. Itâ€™s like something broke
the surface of the sun like you might clear the surface of a pond. After it had been opened up, it
looks like the sun â€˜growsâ€™ back to cover the scar.

The first thought that came to me was â€“ the sun is hollow! Wow, could it be?

That seems kind of crazy, for weâ€™ve all been taught that the sun is so solid that the
pressure induces nuclear reactions. Heck, here is a picture from the Wikipedia on its Sun page
:



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Wikipedia_sun.bmp

Yet, if the sun is rolling plasma, why does it get black spots? Shouldnâ€™t there be
plasma underneath?

Or, I thought, maybe itâ€™s a tick with regards to how the picture is taken. So I looked
that up. When you take a picture of the sun you use a filter to remove 99% of the light. So, in the
picture weâ€™re seeing nearly 100 percent more light from the surface of the sun than in
the â€˜spotâ€™.

This is kind of weird. If the cooler shell of the sun has been removed, wouldnâ€™t you
think weâ€™d see the hotter interior? One would expect that it would probably give off
more light than the surface?

So then I threw all caution to the wind and ask Google. Google seems omniscient sometimes. The
question I typed was â€œIs the sun hollow?â€� The first site that it found was one
with the title â€œFree Planetâ€� and the article was The Sun is Hollow . I actually
laughed when that page came up.

I read some of the words, but the best part is the video included on the page. Itâ€™s titled
An Empty Sun â€“ Is Gravity being Induced? And Iâ€™ve embedded it here for your
enjoyment. Itâ€™s just ten minutes and itâ€™s worth the time.



I love the comparisons that are done between what is classically known as part of the saying
â€“ so above as below.

About a 1:10 in the narrator shows that when things spin around (in a coffee cup) whatâ€™s
in the center is an absence of matter. He relates that to the center of our solar system. Which
means what? â€Š

The part about the ear having two functional attributes â€“ detecting pressure waves
and gravitational alignment â€“ is also rather interesting. About 3:45 in, the
narrator asks, â€œAre pressure and gravity to manifestations of the same
force?â€�

And the bits about vacuum in space.Â  Lol. There is lots of stuff in space always. This leads
the Goodfellow to state that the lows of pressure apply to outer space just like they do in the
boundaries of our own atmosphere! What a brilliant observation (Just over 5 minutes in).

Itâ€™s amazing whenever I see something so simply put that it challenges conventional
knowledge. This little video does exactly that. Itâ€™s almost like the expanding
planet video that I came across in a previous posting ( An Expando Planet Theory ).

This video also seems to align with another series that I put up a while ago in the article Plasma
interactions create light? Iâ€™m going to have to revisit that series and see how it
relates.

For now, I think I got my question answered. It seems that Iâ€™m not the only one that has
questioned why there are â€˜spotsâ€™ on the sun! September 26th, 2011 | Category:

Quick and Easy Garden Hummus



Some days I feel more creative than others. Yesterdayâ€™s creativity has bleed over
into today and I have to admit that this Hummus is just as good today as it was last night. Yet this
time, Iâ€™ve got pictures and the recipe to share!

Last night I wanted a heavier salad. I wanted something with substance that would last a few
hours for I didnâ€™t want to find myself snacking throughout the evening. Thus, I
reached for one of my favorite things: sunflower seeds! I figured Iâ€™d just blend them
up in a salad dressing and pour it over my salad.

Well, it turned out pasty and it sat like a pile of green **** in the center of the bowl. Lori
looked at it and shook her head no without even giving it a try. I think the light green color
turned her off. After a little convincing, she gave it a try and, even though she
doesnâ€™t like hummus (and thatâ€™s what she called it) she took a big spoonful as
her salad dressing.

And it was great!

I made this again for lunch today and it tasted just as good. Yum. So, Iâ€™m writing it down
so it will be around for next summer.

Recipe:



    Image:
    http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8686_ingredients-300x225.jpg
    1 small (normal) zucchini pealed

    - The tops of 7 or 8 basil plants

    

    - 1 cup course chopped carrots

    

    - Âœ cup sunflower seeds

    

    - 2 Tbs cold pressed olive oil

    

    - Âœ Tb balsamic vinegar

    

    - Bit of salt (little bit on spoon)

    



As you can see, Iâ€™ve got oil, vinegar, salt and Basil as if itâ€™s a salad
dressing. But the rest gives it body that makes it more hummus like than salad dressing like.
So, place it all in the blender.



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8687_stacked-300x225.jpg

I put the zucchini in first for the bulk of the water is going to come from there.

Now, blend. Youâ€™ll need your tamper for this is just like making hummusâ€ŠÂ 
Well, it is hummus! Press the veggies down into the blades until it starts to turn. At that
point, youâ€™re going to let it blend for about 30 seconds on â€˜10â€™ (if you
have a Vita-mix). During this time I make sure the blender doesnâ€™t suck air down to the
blades stopping the spin. To do this, you hold the tamper right down to where the mixture turns
over. The temper gently plugs the hole preventing air while letting the blender turn the
ingredients.



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8689_finished-300x225.jpg

As you can see, I got just a little over two cups from this ingredient list. And itâ€™s
wonderful!

The best part about this is that itâ€™s really easy and fast. If you donâ€™t mind the
green color, you donâ€™t even have to peal the zucchini. The sunflower seeds are also
straight out of the bag â€“ no soaking or sprouting! From start to finish itâ€™s
probably 10 minutes.

Also note that the ingredients were mostly from the garden â€“ that is, the carrots,
zucchini and basil. I love it when I get the opportunity to eat suck fresh living foods. I can
basically pick the produce, wash, blend and enjoy in the matter of minutes. The vitality
contained in the plants never gets lost. Eat living foods and youâ€™ll find your own
vitality will increase.

Peach Spinach Smoothie



Every time I tell Lori that Iâ€™m going to introduce someone new to green smoothies she
says, â€œYouâ€™ve got to make them the Peach Spinach one!â€� If Lori could
have it her way, this would be the only green smoothie that sheâ€™d drink. Iâ€™ve
got a lot of favorites, and this one is right up there on the top of the list.

If youâ€™re new to green smoothies or if you want to introduce a friend to how good they can
be, consider making them this one. Itâ€™s easy, quick and tastes like desert!

Recipe:



    Image:
    http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8678_ingredients-300x225.jpg

    - 2 ripe peaches (maybe three)

    

    - 2 Medjool dates

    

    - 1 cup coconut milk

    

    - Âœ lb Fresh young baby spinach

    

    - Âœ cup rejuvelac (optional)

    



Add liquids, pit the fruit and add it. Blend for about 10 seconds.



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8679_fruit-300x225.jpg

Pack in as much spinach as will fit. I generally recommend Âœ lb. Remember, green smoothies
are all about getting the greens! Thus, donâ€™t skimp.



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8681_greens-225x300.jpg

Now, use the tamper and blend for another 50-60 seconds until itâ€™s creamy smooth.



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8683_finished-225x300.jpg

I used three fairly large peaches and a little over a cup liquid and Iâ€™ve got a fancy
glass for the princess and a quart jar for myself. If you cut back to just two peaches,
youâ€™ll probably just get a quart of smoothie.

Remember â€“ a quart a day keeps the doctor away! September 25th, 2011 | Tags: Coconut

Strawberry Pear Apple Parsley Smoothie



Whatâ€™s in a name? How about, surprise goodness. Or smoothie by happenstance. Maybe, I
canâ€™t believe this mixes together so nicely.Â  lol!

I have to say that I was a bit surprised by this combination. The first one I tried happened
because I was hutting around for fruit and, well, all the exotic stuff was gone and all I had left
where pieces that I was tied of eating. I had a beat-up pear, an older kind of soft apple but that
wasnâ€™t enough. I dug around in the freezer and found some strawberries and thought
what the heck.

That adventurous happenstance turned out nice enough to want to share with the rest of the
world. And, well, here it is!



    Image:
    http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8670_ingredients-300x225.jpg

    - 1 pear

    

    - 1 apple

    

    - 10 frozen (or fresh) Strawberries

    

    - 2 Medjool dates

    

    - ÂŸ cup coconut milk

    

    - ÂŸ cup rejuvelac

    

    - 1 bunch fresh garden picked parsley

    



Add everything but the greens to you high speed blender. Grind to a liquid. That might take
about 10 seconds.



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8671_halfway-300x225.jpg
Next, add your greens. Remember, green smoothies are all about getting your greens in a way
that is raw and enjoyable. As you can see, I try to always use a â€˜bunchâ€™ of
parsley. The stores are pretty good about selling bunches in the size that works perfect in a
smoothie.

Now blend again. This time, after the greens are chopped, youâ€™ll want to spin the
blender on high for about a minute. The longer you go, the smoother the smoothie. At the same
time, the longer you go the warmer it gets. Because weâ€™re using frozen strawberries,
you shouldnâ€™t notice any heating in that 60 seconds.



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8673_finished-300x225.jpg

In the end, depending on the size of the fruit that you use, youâ€™ll get 4 to 5 cups.

Even if you have an aversion to parsley, you might find this one a little more tolerable. If
youÂ  like parsley, youâ€™ll probably really enjoy this one. If you love parsley
(like me!) youâ€™ll want to make this smoothie a number of days in a row!

Remember, if you get to experimenting with green smoothies, it always helps to keep the Green
Smoothie Basics in mind. They taste best when balancing sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Once
the balance if found, it then a matter of accentuating the flavor!

What is The Philosopher’s Stone?





Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/JosephWright-Alchemist-211x300.jpg
I would love to be able to truthfully tell you â€“ exactly – what The
Philosopherâ€™s Stone is, but, the simple fact is that you would be hard pressed to find
anyone that could tell you. At least, if Iâ€™ve run into someone that has experienced The
Philosopherâ€™s Stone, they didnâ€™t share that fact with me. When you really
think about it, youâ€™d have to ask yourself – why would they? What would they have to
gain from telling anyone? Or, probably more importantly, would they stand to lose anything?
The later seems more probable. Yet, there still may be clues that we can follow that will help us
understand.

As many of you know, I came across The Book of Aquarius a few months back and mentioned that I
would keep you informed regarding my observations in the forum. If you havenâ€™t read
the book, I highly encourage you to give it a few hours. Itâ€™s a free download and an easy
read. Also, visit the forum if you have questions and, or, if youâ€™re like me,
youâ€™ll visit the forum in order to get a better understanding with regards to what
people are thinking.

Of all the questions that people mention in the forum, the thing that surprises me the most is
that there are a lot of questions that seem to indicated that the readers have not picked up a
basic understanding of what The Philosopherâ€™s Stone is. But can you blame them? The
information that can be found on the net is pretty vague. The definitions describe that it can
do, but do not really describe what it is.

Letâ€™s look at what it can do and then see if we can get some hints about its true nature
from its actions.

As much as people hate Wikipedia, I love the fact that itâ€™s a data source created by
multiple people. It may or may not be the absolute truth, but it should give us the general
concept (if nothing else) from which we can continue our search. So, here is a bit from
Wikipediaâ€™s Philosopherâ€™s Stone section.

The philosopher’s stone ( Latin : lapis philosophorum ) is a legendary alchemical
substance said to be capable of turning base metals ( lead , for example) into gold (
chrysopoeia ) or silver . It was also sometimes believed to be an elixir of life , useful for
rejuvenation and possibly for achieving immortality . For many centuries, it was the most
sought-after goal in Western alchemy . The philosopher’s stone was the central symbol of
the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, enlightenment ,
and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosopher’s stone were known as the Magnum
Opus . [1]

To help us come to a better understanding regarding this substance/item, Iâ€™m going to
track some key points so that we can review them later. When looking at the above paragraph, I
find, 1) It can turn base metals into gold (or silver), 2) it is useful for rejuvenation, 3) it
may help someone achieve immortality, 4) It is believed to be an elixir of life. Weâ€™ll
keep this list and add to it as we come across other definitions.

From the same Wikipedia link above , letâ€™s read more about its properties.

The philosopher’s stone has been attributed with many mystical and magical properties.
The most commonly mentioned properties are the ability to transmute base metals into gold or
silver, and the ability to heal all forms of illness and prolong the life of any person who
consumes a small part of the philosopher’s stone. [12] Other mentioned properties
include: creation of perpetually burning lamps, [12] transmutation of common crystals into
precious stones and diamonds, [12] reviving of dead plants, [12] creation of flexible or
malleable glass, [13] or the creation of a clone or golem . [14]

Letâ€™s add to our list 5) creation of perpetually burning lamps, 6) transmutation of
common crystals into precious stones, 7) reviving dead plants,

Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif
creation of flexible glass, 9) creation of a clone.

The appearance, from what I read at the same link, is pretty specific.

Descriptions of the Philosopher’s Stone are numerous and various. [18] According to
alchemical texts, the philosopher’s stone came in two varieties, prepared by an almost
identical method: white (for the purpose of making silver), and red (for the purpose of making
gold), the white stone being a less matured version of the red stone. [19] Some ancient and
medieval alchemical texts leave clues to the supposed physical appearance of the
philosopher’s stone, specifically the red stone. It is often said to be orange (saffron
colored) or red when ground to powder. Or in a solid form, an intermediate between red and
purple, transparent and glass-like. [20] The weight is spoken of as being heavier than gold,
[21] and it is said to be soluble in any liquid, yet incombustible in fire. [22]

We can add to its attributes that it is 10) White, or 11) Red. 12) It is prepared, rather than
found. 13) It is glass like and can be ground into a powder. 14) It is heavier than gold. 15) It is
soluble in any liquid. 16) It is incombustible in fire.

So far, it doesnâ€™t seem like there is anything specific that contradicts the other
attributes. That physical description seems pretty believable. Itâ€™s almost as if
someoneâ€™s seen The Philosopherâ€™s Stone and actually ground it into a powder!

Letâ€™s dig around and see what else we can find.

The Crystalinks website has an interesting page about The Philosopherâ€™s Stone . What
surprises me is that it mirrors much of the data found on Wikipedia. I couldnâ€™t tell you
which location would be the source. There is also a nice page of links to other alchemy related
pages. Youâ€™ll have to be careful surfing through these links for you might be there for
days!

On the little more bazaar side of things, I found a channeling of Atun-Re by Kevin Ryerson .

The philosopher’s stone that was sought so long by the alchemists of Egypt, Atlantis,
Babylon, and amongst the kings in the farthermost reaches of the East and West, is your own
consciousness. Yes, my children, the philosopher’s stone is your own consciousness.

Iâ€™m open minded with regards to people channeling stuff, but Iâ€™m always
finding myself looking to validate this type of information. Iâ€™m going to add this
attribute to the list unless we can find something that is conflicts with. For now 17) it is your
own consciousness.

The next quote is a blurb from AlchemyLab.com . This one is a little more personal for it is the
stone according to the Sufis (a Muslim ascetic and mystic) point of view. Here we find:

The stone according to the Sufis, is the dhat , the essence, which is so powerful that it can
transform whatever comes into contact with it.Â  It is the essence of man, which partakes of
what people call the divine.Â  It is â€œsunshine,â€� capable of uplifting
humanity to the next stage….

â€Š

This Philosopherâ€™s Stone or Universal Elixir was an alchemical preparation made
from the mineral kingdom. The Medieval philosoÂ­phers claimed that when properly
prepared the mineral stone could transmute base metals into gold; in minute dilutions it
could end sickness and retard aging indefinitely, transmuting the human organism into an
immortal being. [1] [31]

â€Š

In what indicates a continuity of traditions, like the Hindu and Chinese alchemistsâ€™
sacred elixir of immortality , the adepts claimed that when taken in a minute dose, this
substance would cause the inbiberâ€™s hair and teeth to fall out, later new hair and
teeth grow in and the successful alchemist became immortal.

To these mystics, it is 18) â€˜the essenceâ€™ that can transform whatever come into
contact with it. It is also 19) the essence of man, which partakes of what people call the
divine. And 20) it is â€œsunshineâ€� capable of uplifting humanity.

The interesting thing about these mystics is that they put a little more thought into
describing what it is rather than simply what it does, for with these additions to the list we
get both a description of what it is along with its action.

Oh, and, 21) it will make your hair and teeth fall out as they will be replaced.

Stepping outside the world of words, we can also find audio clips. A few days ago, The Book of
Aquarius was mentioned on the Coast to Coast show with Jay Weidner . Itâ€™s pretty clear
that Jay hasnâ€™t created The Philosopherâ€™s Stone, but he has put time into
studying its properties. If youâ€™ve got time, the first 15 minutes are so of the show is
where itâ€™s discussed.

If youâ€™re looking for the condensed version, Jay sees it as concentrated Chi. It is the
life force Prana that many different philosophies talk about.Â  Here is a link that might
give you a better idea of what Chi is: The Buddha Garden .

Jay might be onto something, so Iâ€™m going to add that to our list: 22) It is concentrated
Chi energy.

And then, of course, there is the definition in The Book of Aquarius which reads (Page 11, first
addition. Start of chapter 4.)

The Philosopherâ€™s Stone is energy, concentrated and purified to a massively high
degree. This is the same energy that you are taking in when you breathe, and when you eat and
drink. It is the energy that powers all forms of life, and so I will call it life-energy (since I
have to call is something and â€œlife-energyâ€� is self-explanatory.)

This definition seems to fit what Jayâ€™s figured out. What I find fascinating in this
definition is that there are no physical characteristics described; no color, no mass, no
texture. Itâ€™s just purified energy.

After poking around a bit more, I found another website that has a pretty good write up
regarding The Stone. Itâ€™s on MonTalk under The Philosopherâ€™s Stone page .
Here, itâ€™s not specifically about The Philosopherâ€™s Stone, but rather
general about Alchemy.

Alchemical achievements require successful gathering, concentrating, and multiplying of
etheric energy. When this energy reaches a critical threshold, it overpowers the normal laws
of physics and allows seemingly miraculous processes to take place.

…

Alchemy does not violate the laws of physics, nor does it always follow them, rather it bends
them as needed. It operates upon the quantum foundation from which these laws arise in the
first place, via etheric energy affecting the probability of quantum events.

The idea here is that The Philosopherâ€™s Stone is a product of Alchemy which is the act of
concentrating (etheric) energy. This implies that The Philosopherâ€™s Stone is
concentrated etheric energy. Iâ€™m not sure how to differentiate that from Chi, so
Iâ€™m going to keep this in the same category.

You can search around the web and find a lot more examples, but they all seem to come to the same
basic description and characteristics. Now is probably a good time to list what weâ€™ve
discovered.

    What it can do:

    - It can turn base metals into gold (or silver)

    

    - It is useful for rejuvenation

    

    - It may help someone achieve immortality

    

    - Creation of perpetually burning lamps

    

    - Transmutation of common crystals into precious stones

    

    - Reviving dead plants

    

    - Creation of flexible glass

    

    - Creation of a clone

    

    - It will make your hair and teeth fall out as they will be replaced

    



    What itâ€™s described as:

    - It is believed to be an elixir of life

    

    - It is White

    

    - It is Red

    

    - It is prepared, rather than found

    

    - It is glass like and can be ground into a powder

    

    - It is heavier than gold

    

    - It is soluble in any liquid

    

    - It is incombustible in fire

    

    - It is your own consciousness

    

    - It is concentrated Chi energy

    



    What is it and does together

    - It is â€˜the essenceâ€™ that can transform whatever come into contact with it

    

    - It is the essence of man, which partakes of what people call the divine

    

    - It is â€œsunshineâ€� capable of uplifting humanity

    



As I promised above, itâ€™s now time to look to see if we can get a better picture of what it
is based upon what The Philosopherâ€™s Stone can do. But first, letâ€™s make some
assumptions based on the actual descriptions that have been recorded over time.

It is pretty clear that The Stone has physical characteristics. It has color, mass and
texture. Unlike conceptual things like awareness, which canâ€™t be seen or touched,
The Stone is an actual object which can be touched. It is also described as an elixir, in its
simplest terms, is a potion.

Where things get a little fuzzy is when itâ€™s described as consciousness, Chi and life.
Yeah, I might have stretched that last point just a little, but what really is an â€˜elixir
of lifeâ€™? Forever, The Stone has been called â€˜an elixir of lifeâ€™. When
you think about that statement, the typical response is that itâ€™s a magic potion that
gives you more life. Well, how can it give you more life if it is not life itself?

It makes me think of The Stone as a magic potion that is life. At the same time, it makes you wonder
what life is also. When we look life up in the Wikipedia we see that others ponder this thought
too:

It is still a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life in unequivocal terms.
[12] [13] [14]

And, why is it a challenging exercise? Well, as I see it, life is a concept rather than an object.
Life is like awareness. Awareness is not a thing, but an action. Life seems to be in that same
type of category. It is what is done. We live life. All things live life.

So, in this sense, when The Philosopherâ€™s Stone is through of as â€˜an elixir of
lifeâ€™, I would guess that it could be thought of as a potion that gives you more of what
you do â€“ you live your life. Â 

How does that align with the other descriptions? Well, Chi (Qi) is generally thought of as:

In traditional Chinese culture , qÃ¬ (also chi or ch’i ) is an active principle forming
part of any living thing. Qi is frequently translated as “lifeforce” or “ energy
flow”, and is comparable to the Hindu yogic science of prana , meaning “life force” in
Sanskrit .

And Prana is:

In Vedantic philosophy, prana is the notion of a vital, life -sustaining force of living
beings and vital energy , comparable to the Chinese notion of Qi . Prana is a central concept in
Ayurveda and Yoga , where it is believed to flow through a network of fine subtle channels
called nadis . Its most subtle material form is the breath, but it is also to be found in the
blood, and its most concentrated form is semen in men and vaginal fluid in women. [1]

So when thought of as â€˜an elixir of lifeâ€™, I translate this statement into
something like â€“ it is a concentrated form of the vital energy that living entities
need and use at all times.

Now, how does all this relate to what The Philosopherâ€™s Stone is known to do?

Well, this should seem obvious when we look at rejuvenation, immortality, reviving dead
plants and creating clones. When you think about reviving a plant, you canâ€™t help but
think that youâ€™ve got to give it â€˜lifeâ€™. If The Stone is life, then you
would give it some of the stone and, well, youâ€™d probably see the plant come back to
life. Regarding rejuvenation, if someone gets to the point where the Chi doesnâ€™t flow
through them very well, in Chinese medicine, they would be considered sick. Many sicknesses
have been linked to poorly flowing Chi or very low levels of vitality. If thatâ€™s what
The Stone is, it would make total sense that the poorly flowing Chi would now become super
amplified â€“ or more present throughout the body â€“ thus leading to
rejuvenation (health). The immortality issue seems a little strange, but natural at the same
time. If death is the lack of life and the elixir is life, one would thing that youâ€™d
never run out of life. Finally, regarding making a clone, well, thatâ€™s just weird! The
only thing I have to say about that is in order to create a living thing; youâ€™ve got to
give it life. If The Stone can do this, it must be life itself.

Now what about transmuting metals and crystals? Well, this would imply that the metals and
crystals are living entities â€“ at least, at one time there were living. It might be
similar to working with wood. When the wood is in the form of a tree, it is living. Itâ€™s
only after processing it into standard lumber that itâ€™s considered dead and stable.
This could very well be the same for metals. When you think about crystals, they form in geodes
given the proper conditions. Scientists tend to think of these conditions as heat, pressure
and purity. They donâ€™t think of one of the conditions as being â€“ living. My
guess would be that when the stone is added to these elements, they are brought back to life and
they continue to grow towards their final destination. Who would have thought that metals
where once alive?

What is interesting about transmuting different substances is that there is not just one
substance that it works on! The Stone is said to work on humans as well as plants and now it works
on different metals and crystals. This might just imply that the vital life energy can be
imprinted (or seeded) with some specific type of life form. That might imply that if you want to
grow emeralds, you would have to concentrate this vital life force energy and imprint it with
the â€˜essenceâ€™ of emeralds. The Alchemical texts talk about a fermenting
process that needs to be done before The Stone will make more of itself. It would seem that this
might be a simple, doable, operation.

Lastly, it is considered the â€˜essence.â€™ If you look up a common definition of
essence, you will find that it is â€œA property or group of properties of something
without which it would not exist or be what it is.â€� (See Googleâ€™s Define:
essence functionality.) One of the attributes that I included above mention that it is the
divine essence of man. In other words, man would not be what he is if this vital life force energy
was not present.

In a fairly quick overview, it seems that the mystery of The Philosopherâ€™s Stone is not
all that much of a mystery. It is both an object and a concept at the same time. It is something
that can be understood and, hopefully, concentrated. I am excited that there are people that
are actively participating in the quest for The Philosopherâ€™s Stone. It seems like
such a private quest, yet to those in The Book of Aquarius forum, it is public for the entire
world to see!

So, if you find yourself wondering what exactly is The Philosopherâ€™s Stone, the first
thing that I would do is to think of it as concentrated life sustaining energy like Chi (or
Prana). When thinking about how it might be used, you would administer it to objects that you
want to give more life too. When you think about how it might affect a person in the forms of
â€˜an elixir of lifeâ€™ you would think that it would super-saturate the human body
with Chi. If sickness is related to poor Chi, sickness would no longer be an issue.

Make sense?

Now, the next step is making The Philosopherâ€™s Stone.Â  â€Š September 18th,

Inner Sight & Memory



Here is another characteristic of Your Being that you may take for granted; visualization!
How visions are formed is a direct reflection between who you are and what youâ€™ve
experienced (or going to experience).

Yet, before we really get into this posting, I would encourage you to review a couple posting
that are very similar. They are Input & Output â€“ Perceiving and Creating and Intuition
& Ego . The only real difference here is that weâ€™ll be investigating vision and a bit
about how that personal tool works.

Everyone knows that when light reflects off something it can be seen. The sensing process
takes place with the eyes. The general process has been outlined fairly well on Wikipedia
under Visual Perception :

The visual system in humans allows individuals to assimilate information from the
environment. The act of seeing starts when the lens of the eye focuses an image of its
surroundings onto a light-sensitive membrane in the back of the eye, called the retina . The
retina is actually part of the brain that is isolated to serve as a transducer [ citation needed
] for the conversion of patterns of light into neuronal signals. The lens of the eye focuses
light on the photoreceptive cells of the retina, which detect the photons of light and respond
by producing neural impulses . These signals are processed in a hierarchical fashion by
different parts of the brain, from the retina upstream to central ganglia in the brain .

This first part of the definition of Visual Perception really only seems to cover the
mechanics of how the body receives the light â€“ the sensory side of things. Sure, that
photon of light gets converted from one form of energy into another as it enters the body, but
how do we actually see? Where is the perception based on that collection of photons?

If you follow the link on Wikipedia to Perception , we read:

Perception (from the Latin perceptio, percipio ) is the process of attaining awareness or
understanding of the environment by organizing and interpreting sensory information . [1]
[2]

So, the perception part would be tied in with the understanding that we get from the visual
sensory information. This would imply that there is action involved (on our part) with
regards to being aware of what is seen rather than simply seeing it.

This kind makes sense when you think about the philosophical idea that when two people look at
the same painting, they see to different things (stories, impressions, etc.). Basically, if
you show two different people the exact same item (painting, photo or something else fairly
large in visual imagery) they will â€˜seeâ€™ different things in the picture. When
you look closer at how the person actually goes about â€˜seeingâ€™ what is in that
picture, what gets seen is what the personâ€™s awareness is focused on. As the
personâ€™s awareness moves from one area of the picture (image) to another, they become
consciously aware of what is in this new area.

So, even though light enters the eyes, the only thing that is â€˜seenâ€™ is what you
are aware of.

This reminds me of adventures that Iâ€™ve had frogginâ€™. At different points in
my life Iâ€™ve had time to walk streams (or ponds) in order to spot frogs. There have been
many times when Iâ€™ve stood (or squatted) at the waterâ€™s edge and intently
looked for frogs with no success. I would thoroughly look over every spot where a frog might sit
(or hide) and not see anything â€“ until the frog moved! It is amazing how well (and long) a
frog can remain outside of someoneâ€™s awareness. They can be sitting right in front of
you and you just canâ€™t see it. Even after it moves, if you take your eyes off it, that frog
has the magic of blending which can make it really hard to continually remain aware if
itâ€™s location.

So even though are light organ (eyes) receives light, it is what our Being is aware of that
determines if we actually see it or not.

This gets really interesting when you close your eyes and still experience
â€˜seeingâ€™ things. How is it that we can get the sense of seeing when weâ€™re
not receiving light directly thorough our eyes?

The first thing that would come to mind is that you remember the image. This idea is based upon
memory. You simply remember what it looked like. The concept here is that at the moment you
remember the image, you are once again bringing your awareness to that experience. This is a
situation where, in your mind (where ever that may be) your awareness explores the details of
the image a second time.

It would seem that if this is the case â€“ people have the ability to remember an image
â€“ it might imply that the light from the original experience becomes part of us.
Itâ€™s like we eat photons! As we see, that light enters the body and gets stored. This
might be more supporting data for the fact that we are light Beings (maybe see Living on
Sunlight and the referenced postings). Or, maybe, itâ€™s not the light that is stored,
but rather the experience â€“ as part of your awareness. The light was used as a tool so
that your awareness could grow.

The end result of taking in all this light really has little to do with the act of visualization.
The process of visualizing something is very similar to the process of intuiting something.
Visualization is a direct exchange of information from Your Being into the physical world. It
is the same whether youâ€™re remembering something or visualizing something.

Maybe a simple exercise could help.

Sense we know that in order to â€˜seeâ€™ something we have to bring our awareness to
it, weâ€™ll want to do just that. What Iâ€™ve found is that there are different
types of sensual stimulation that overpowers the subtle energies so you have to make a
conscious effort to â€˜remove the noiseâ€™. Thus, Iâ€™ve found a technique
during meditation that works pretty good for me right now. It goes like this.

Assume a meditative posture (this is one of the key reasons why I do yoga). You want to be
sitting, maybe cross-legged or in a chair, but the most important part is that you have to be
able to completely relax. I sit in Easy Pose . Some days Iâ€™ll turn my palms up, other days
Iâ€™ll cup my knees. But, like I said earlier, the key thing is to be able to get relaxed.
This only really happens when you have a straight vertical spine. Now close your eyes and then
breathe slow and steady. Your breathing should fill your lungs but only to the point just
before you feel the muscles tense up. Now breathe for a while.

During this breathing time where you make a conscious effort to remain completely relaxed,
you should feel a change in energy. Or, said differently (and maybe a little more accurately),
the energy that you normally use to sense everything on a daily basis is no longer needed and
your awareness can expand beyond itâ€™s normal â€˜confinesâ€™. That is, if
you no longer place energy into using your eyes, your sense of hearing becomes heightened. If
you no longer place energy into moving your muscles, that energy doesnâ€™t
â€˜cloud the pondâ€™ so to speak allowing your awareness to explore other subtle
energies.

After a little time, youâ€™ll notice that youâ€™re doing the right thing when you
start becoming aware of things that you previously didnâ€™t sense. An example might be
that when you first start your meditation, you were aware of your posture and breathing. Yet,
after a while, the sound of the birds chirping outside resonate loud and clear. Before you got
into this relaxed state you had no idea about the birds playing outside, yet after minimizing
the dominate energies that rule your life, the sounds they make come to the foreground and grab
your attention.

It is at this point where visualizations become easy. It is at this point where youâ€™ve
calmed the energy that you emit to the point where subtle energies can be recognized. In other
words, itâ€™s like once youâ€™ve removed the energy that creates big waves in a
pond, youâ€™re able to see the little waves. (Or when you remove the waves you make you can
detect the waves others make.)

The next step is that you have to set an intention for the visualization. If you want to remember
something, you have to â€˜wantâ€™ to remember it. You have to have some type of
desire to kick start the communication. For me, this is the point where I use the translator in
my head to help drive the experience â€“ yet only in a limited fashion for the energy used
by the ego is a crude noisy energy that can create â€˜larger waves in the pond.â€™
Thus, you ask, and then clean the slate so the visualization can occur. Said differently, you
make room for your awareness to go to a previous experience and feel it again. Or, you make room
for Your Being to share energies about what will be. In either case, if youâ€™re in the
state where youâ€™re not putting out much energy (youâ€™re calm) you
wonâ€™t blow away the imaging that Your Being experiences.

What you might find is that this exercise is very similar to dreaming. But it is a conscious
dream where you can either manipulate it or simply experience it. When you relate this to
dreaming, Your Being shares visualizations with you in some type of sequence and, at some
point, you become conscious that youâ€™re dreaming. At that point, you can either let
the dream continue uninterrupted or you might replay it slightly differently if you
didnâ€™t like the way it was playing out. In the dream, the visions that you have up to the
point of conscious manipulation are an unaltered communication from Your Being . At and after
the point of manipulation the dream is a creation influenced by the ego.

Regardless to whether you spend time visualizing or remembering, the art of getting to the
point where this can happen is the same and the act of doing it is a matter of bring your awareness
to that experience or desire.

After all this, the question should arise, why is this important?

Because time is immaterial to Your Being !

What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? Well, when you visualize something it
may or may not have actually occurred. If it did occur, itâ€™s a memory. If it has not
occurred, itâ€™s a projection. In either case, the visualization energy can stimulate
a physical response allowing you to relive the feeling of a past experience or allow you to
generate feelings for a future experience! The energy that generates a physical response is
the energy that will fulfill your desire.

Thatâ€™s right. You can visualize events that you want to experience. When your
visualizations generate an emotional or physical response, you know that the experience is
strong. The stronger the energy that you use for projection, the more likely (or faster) that
experience will become reality.

Your inner sight is a wonderful tool that you have to relive previous experiences or shape new
ones. This sight is a direct link between Your Being and your physical experiences. If you
remove the noise of everyday life, you will see that your awareness can be brought to this
aspect of Your Being so as to enrich your experiences and relive treasured emotional
experiences. September 11th, 2011 | Category: Human Energy , Light is Life , Philosophy |

Raw Cantaloupe Sorbet



What a great way to finish a scorching hot weekend â€“ fresh raw ice cold sorbet! And,
seeing that weâ€™re rounding out the last really nice days of the summer, the melons are
sweet and plentiful. Thus, tonight, I whipped up some fresh raw cantaloupe sorbet.

If youâ€™re not a big cantaloupe fan, thereâ€™s nothing about this sorbet that
will make it less â€Š well, â€Š cantaloupe tasting. But, if you are a fan, this will be a
summer treat unlike any other sorbet. Thereâ€™s nothing like light, fluffy, creamy,
soft, cold sweet melon to top off the night with a smile.

Oh, before the pictures, I canâ€™t believe how hard it is to find a raw cantaloupe sorbet
recipe on the web. I guess people really donâ€™t like this stuff â€“ or â€“ at
least the raw folks havenâ€™t really figured this one out yet. Iâ€™ll post it and
hopefully the world of folks reading here can conspire to enhance this recipe so as to really
make this melon flavor pop!



Image:
http://blog.genuineobservations.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_8659_ingredients-300x225.jpg

    Recipe:

    - Âœ ripe cantaloupe melon

    

    - 1 Mireâ€™s lemon

    

    - ÂŒ cup pure raw agave syrup

    



As you can see, the ingredient list is really simple. Make sure that you donâ€™t use a
large melon, but simply a great ripe medium size one. Cut it in half, remove the seeds and
proceed to slice the melon into small cubes for youâ€™re going to place it in the freezer
for 1 hour. If you space them out well, they will cool faster.

Once lightly frozen, squeeze the juice of the lemon and add the agave syrup to your high powered
blender (a cheap blender wonâ€™t have the muscle to liquefy this fruit when itâ€™s
frozen). Using the tamper, quickly grind the melon chunks into your sorbet. Itâ€™s
going to be thick, so youâ€™ll have to work hard and fast.

One trick is to quickly get it mixed up and turn the blender off. At this point, there will still
be really small chunks, but you can taste it to see if itâ€™s got the right amount of
sweetener. If the fruit is really ripe, youâ€™ll want to use less syrup. Once it tastes
right, youâ€™ll want to get back to blending; but this time on high so it can be really
fluffed up. This shouldnâ€™t take more than about 20 seconds. If you blend too long,
youâ€™ll melt it into juice â€“ so be quick!

In the end, youâ€™ll get a great soft-serve that will slowly melt in a room temperature
bowl.

I have to admit that this recipe doesnâ€™t knock your socks off, but if you like melon
(like I do) youâ€™ll get a great cold melon surprise that will satisfy any late night
craving!

Enjoyâ€Š

Oh, and like I said above, if you give this one a try and find something to add that would
complement the cantaloupe, please feel free to share! Next time I might add a couple
strawberries or maybe a spoon full of powdered cacao. Iâ€™ll update this posting if
(when) I do. September 5th, 2011 | Tags: Agave , cantaloupe , lemon | Category: Raw Food , Raw

Input & Output – Perceiving and Creating



There might have been a bit of confusion when trying to understand my precious article
Intuition & Ego . In that posting, I didnâ€™t clearly define the terms that I used and used
a number of different words in order to try to explain the same (or similar) thing. Hopefully,
the information below will help clarify what Iâ€™d intended to say.

To begin, Iâ€™d like to make sure my understanding of Your Being is clear. To help,
Iâ€™d like to bring in what the Wikipedia has to say as a reference. But, in doing so, we
have to look at how they describe Being , for I want to deal with the concept Your Being . So, the
Wikipedia states:

Being (i.e. be + -ing , by synecdoche ), is an English word used for conceptualizing subjective
and objective aspects of reality, including those fundamental to the self â€”related
to and somewhat interchangeable with terms like “ existence ” and “ living “. In its
objective usage â€”as in “a being,” or “[a] human being ” â€”it refers to a
discrete life form that has properties of mind ( sentience ), which are deemed to constitute a
more complex state than simple organisms (i.e. that have only “ life functions “). [
citation needed ]

In abstract usage, “the being” or “one’s being” is the mind’s concept of the self
as a whole entity â€”including both mind and body â€”wherein the being is in the
mind , and the “body” is all sensory aspects within the being . Heidegger coined the
Germanic term “ dasein ” for this property of being in his influential work Sein und Zeit
(“this entity which each of us is himselfâ€Šwe shall denote by the term “dasein.”"
[1] ), in which he argued that being or “dasein” links one’s sense of one’s body to
one’s perception of world . Heidegger, amongst others, referred to an innate language as
the foundation of being , which gives signal to (and from, cf. cognition ) all aspects of being .

The way that I used the word Being in the previous posting fit directly with the first part of the
second paragraph where it refers to the â€œconcept of the selfâ€�. The difference
is that in that quote itâ€™s stated that â€œâ€Š the being is in the mind , and the
“body” is all sensory aspects within the being .â€�

With my current understanding, I would word this differently. Something like: Your Being
encompasses all that you are including your mind, body and everything else that makes up who
and what You are. Your Being is the root of who you are. Your Being is the â€˜ Iâ€™ in I am
. In the context in which Iâ€™ll write, Your Being is a unique living entity that has a
whole bunch of tools at its disposal in which to enhance the experience of life.

I would also like to clarify what it means to sense something for itâ€™s a pretty abstract
concept that most people have come to understand as being fairly limited. To me, there are
clear differences between a sense organ and the act of sensing . One is the tool and the other is
how it interacts with Your Being . The Wikipedia has also made the distinction where they list
â€œSenseâ€� and â€œSense (disambiguation)â€�. From Sense , we read the
sense organ type definition:

Senses are the physiological capacities within organisms that provide inputs for
perception .

From Sense (disambiguation) we read:

A sense in biology and psychology, is a physiological method of perception. In common usage, a
sense may also mean an understanding or awareness of something in particular.

This second definition is in line with what Iâ€™m referring to when I write sensing . But
to fill it out more, sensing, and the act of perception, are really closely intertwined. For
when you perceive something, youâ€™ve applied your understanding to what
youâ€™ve sensed. The semiformal definition of perception comes across like:

Perception (from the Latin perceptio, percipio ) is the process of attaining awareness or
understanding of the environment by organizing and interpreting sensory information . [1]
[2] All perception involves signals in the nervous system , which in turn result from physical
stimulation of the sense organs. [3] For example, vision involves light striking the retinas
of the eyes, smell is mediated by odor molecules and hearing involves pressure waves .
Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but can be shaped by learning , memory
and expectation . [4] [5] Perception involves these “top-down” effects as well as the
“bottom-up” process of processing sensory input. [5] Perception depends on complex
functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this
processing happens outside conscious awareness. [3]

This definition is mostly in line with my understanding. The part that I somewhat disagree
with is the part â€œAll perception involves signals in the nervous system , which in turn
result from physical stimulation of the sense organs. [3] â€�. If the definition of
nervous system was Your Being and they dropped the part about â€œâ€Š which in turn
result from physical stimulation of the sense organsâ€� I might feel better about
whatâ€™s been collectively written.

I might write the definition like; Perception is the process of understanding or becoming
aware of sensory information. Perception is a conscious activity, yet sensory stimulation
quite often happens outside of conscious awareness.

    Letâ€™s now bring these three together.

    - Your Being perceives by sensing.Â Â 

    



That came together pretty easy! In a way, it seems so simple. This, to me, is the input side of
life.

Because during the process of life we interact with our environment, there is a similar path
for the output side of life.

To get a better feel for this letâ€™s play with the idea of creativity. What does it mean to
create? The common idea for creativity (similar to the common five senses) comes across like
this:

Creativity refers to the phenomenon whereby a person creates something new (a product, a
solution, a work of art, a novel, a joke, etc.) that has some kind of value. What counts as
“new” may be in reference to the individual creator, or to the society or domain within
which the novelty occurs. What counts as “valuable” is similarly defined in a variety of
ways.

If you look at this common definition while keeping the idea of senses in mind, youâ€™ll
get the feeling that the type of things that they list as being â€˜createdâ€™ are
things that are clearly discoverable by the standard five senses.

To get a better feel for how Iâ€™m using it, we want to go a little deeper.

It is generally thought that “creativity” in Western culture was originally seen as a
matter of divine inspiration . [1]

Following the link to divine inspiration we can see that they broke it up into different
sections. The one that looks most promising is:

Epiphany (feeling) , the sudden realization or comprehension of the essence or meaning of
something

Linking again:

An epiphany (from the ancient Greek áŒ�Ï€Î¹Ï†Î¬ÎœÎµÎ¹Î±,
epiphaneia , “manifestation, striking appearance”) is the sudden realization or
comprehension of the (larger) essence or meaning of something. The term is used in either a
philosophical or literal sense to signify that the claimant has “found the last piece of the
puzzle and now sees the whole picture,” or has new information or experience, often
insignificant by itself, that illuminates a deeper or numinous foundational frame of
reference .

What we see here is that when someone has an epiphany, they have a sudden realization or
comprehension of something. Simply put, how I would interpret this is that Your Being
suddenly becames conscious of something (new). The knowledge or understanding that already
existed now becomes something you can consciously act upon.

And if youâ€™re taking notes, this is similar to what we saw in the previous posting
regarding intuition!

When we go to put these ideas together, I generally refer to creativity as the process by which
Your Being transfers knowledge or understanding (which is generally thought of as an
epiphany or intuitive understanding ) where you actively express that new understanding in
some form. Typically, someone may verbalize the experience to someone, it may be written down
or acted out or felt. In general, it is the act where Your Being communicates in a way that is
detected consciously and acted upon.

    Thus we have our output path:

    - Your Being creates consciously.

    



Â 

The thing that unites these two different key characteristics that make up how you function is
energy! I will leave the energy discussion for another day, but for Your Being to be able to
either receive or transmit information, that information, however subtle it is, needs to
flow to the tools that we have that can interpret it.

The most interesting part is not the energy, but rather the energy flow. The energy flow is what
we experience and call life! That is what needs to happen for us to either sense or create
something. The stronger the energy flow, the larger the impression on Your Being . If the
energy flow is subtle, than the more stimulating energy flows need to be calmed so that the
tools that receive the subtle flows can actually sense or intuit it!

I am so looking forward to expanding upon these ideas with more detailed postings. For now, I
hope you have a better understanding with regards to the words I used in my previous posting
(and some even earlier postings). August 21st, 2011 | Category: Human Energy , Light is Life ,

Intuition & Ego



I love exploring the intricate aspects of what it means to be human. Sure, we are made of flesh
and bone, but there is so much more that really goes into defining how we experience life than
the simple senses : taste, touch, smell, seeing and hearing! We are highly developed sensory
Beings that can â€“ not only sense whatâ€™s going on around us – but actually
shape our own experience. Itâ€™s subtle, but observable â€“ if you put the effort
into watching, practicing and consciously participating in what you do and how the world
responds to what you do.

In order to really do this, one needs to understand what and who they are.

A great book to help the reader get a better understanding of who they are can be found in just
about any bookstore today.Â  It is:

Eckhart Tolle distills complex spiritual theory down into common truth. That common truth
can forever change the way you perceive your world – if you understand what heâ€™s
saying. Fortunately for us, his words have been viewed by so many that itâ€™s easy to find
some of this key ideas on the web.

Looking at Wikipedia, Iâ€™d like to repeat the following section on the ego and internal
presence :

The ego and the deeper Presence

The book begins with Tolle recalling his initial transformational experience when he was
twenty-nine. This spiritual experience was one that not only jolted him into an intense
awareness of the present moment, but also one that suggested his inner being or self had
hitherto unsuspected depths: “am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two
of me: the ‘I’ and the ‘self’ that ‘I’ cannot live with.” [15]

For Tolle the ego is a sense of self derived from the content and activity of the mind. It is “a
mental image of who you are, based on your personal and cultural conditioning.” [16] He
notes that virtually everyone hears a “voice” in their head all the time, the involuntary
and often repetitive thought-processes of our minds. As we live “the voice comments,
speculates, judges, compares, complains, likes, dislikes, and so on.” It may be reliving
the past or rehearsing imagined future situations. [17]

Tolle claims there is a deeper sense of self than the ego, a conscious presence which may be
known in various ways. One method he recommends is simply to listen to the voice in the head
without judging it in any way or getting caught up in its contents. Just by ‘watching the
thinker’ in the head, he says, “You’ll soon realise: there is the voice, and here I am
listening to it.” That I am realisation is “a sense of your own presence … (arising) from
beyond the mind.” [18] And as one becomes aware of this deeper self as a conscious presence,
so the involuntary thinking begins to subside, giving way to stillness, peace and what he
calls “the joy of Being.” [19]

To me, the most important thing that he presents really well is all summed up on the last
paragraph (where I quote the quote): â€œYou’ll soon realise: there is the voice, and
here I am listening to it.â€�

A twisted interpretation might be, not only do I have the sense of touch, the sense of smell and
the sense of sight, but I have the sense of self! Thatâ€™s right, itâ€™s another
attribute of our being human! That voice in your head is no more evil than your sense of smell. It
is â€Š what it is.

That sense of smell can sense small amounts of vapors or various substances but there are a
sequence of events that occur based upon that stimuli. To start with, if youâ€™ve never
smelt a rotting animal, the experience upon detecting this smell is immediately emotional.
The smell is repulsive. Instinctively, you would step away from the smell. Meanwhile, as soon
as the smell is detected, the voice in your head might say â€œOh my God! What a foul smell.
What could that be? Itâ€™s disgustingâ€Šâ€� Then, through a little bit of
investigation you discover the source of the foul smell. At that point, an association is made
between the smell and the source of the smell. Depending on the level education (ability to
label things), you may be able to describe the experience well. If you donâ€™t have any
idea what it is, all you can go on is the emotional experience.

The key thing to notice in this discovery process is that when you sense something it is your
Being that experiences what the senses provide. The voice in your head is a side show that may or
may not fully understand what is being sensed. To me, this is a very strong statement that you
might not want to simply breeze by.

Your Being receives what you sense. The voice in your head does not! Your Being acts upon the
stimuli in a pure unhindered way. The voice in your head responds to what your Being
experiences in order to enhance it. The voice in your head adds an intellectual understanding
to the raw experience.

That voice in your head, because it is language based, can also be thought of as a translator. It
is used to â€˜label experiencesâ€™ in ways that can be shared with others. Note that
the voice in your head didnâ€™t cause the experience, it just translates (or maybe
narrates) the experience.

The experience still happens to the Being.

Thinking back to the smell example above, how is it that the Being (you) first react to the
smell? Does your body process the smell, associate it with rotting flesh and the voice in your
head yells danger – danger? No. You immediately feel repulsed by the smell. You have an
emotional reaction. If the smell had been that of a ripe cantaloupe, the emotional response
would most likely be attractive. The smell would make you feel good. Upon investigating the
smell, you may discover something wonderful to eat. But in every case, the response is
emotional.

Senses generate emotional responses.

Now, what are emotions?

Emotions arenâ€™t something you can touch, smell or see, but there are none-the-less
sensed! You might say that we have the sense of emotion! Ha! Weâ€™ve found another human
sense!

When dealing with emotions, we generally feel either attracted or repealed (to some degree).
Itâ€™s only when the translator gets involved that we start thinking about it as love or
hate, or happiness or sadness, etc.. Keeping the translator aside, the sense of emotion is
normally strong or weak rather than good or bad.

Physically speaking, emotions take the form of energy (light or electrical pulse) more-so
then just about anything. When you deal with the five primary senses, a scientist would say
that the vapor triggers the receptors in your nose to send a signal (via your nervous system) to
your brain where it is processed. If you where to ask me, Iâ€™d say that the vapor triggers
a receptor that sparks the flow of emotion which is understandable by your Being
(consciousness).

This brings us around to how your Being communicates.

If you â€˜listen to the voice in your headâ€™ â€“ how do you hear it?
Youâ€™re ears translate sound waves into electrical impulses (energy, light) that
enters your nervous system that get processed by your Being. It would seem that the voice in
your head would do the same thing if it wanted to be heard (sorry about talking about it as if it
had a â€˜mindâ€™ of its own). In other words, the evidence suggests that your Being
doesnâ€™t hear sound, it senses energy. The voice in your head is simply energy shaped by
your Being.

Converting physical sensations into energy is the technique by which the Being realizes its
experience in the world. The Being doesnâ€™t use organs like eyes and ears, but rather
has eyes and ears and crude ways to sense specific types of energy.

The reverse process: Creation (part of communication).

If you turn this process around, it would make sense that the Being also uses energy to
communicate. If you want to convey something that you â€˜knowâ€™ to someone else,
it generally has to be translated by physical senses (created) so that it can be shared. This
would involve describing a smell or texture in a way that someone else can relate. If they
donâ€™t have an understanding of the words (or the other means of expression) they will
not understand what youâ€™re trying to communicate.

Yet, when you look at how the senses are designed, there are unique paths for input and output.

For instance, even though we hear with our ears (which are considered sensory organs) we speak
to generate sound. The sound that we generate is a direct reflection of our Being. There is
nothing stopping you from saying whatever it is that you want to say. The only time your sound is
censored is when your Being consults the translator (voice in your head) to make sure that what
will be said is exactly what you intend to say.

There is also movement and expression. Your body will naturally reflect your current
emotional state. It is pretty easy to physically see the difference between someone that is
happy and someone that is sad. These are universal traits that form a layer of communication
â€“ weather you are aware if it or not.

When it comes to communication, the energy flows from your Being and gets translated as that
energy makes it into physical form. If the energy can make it through unedited, itâ€™s a
pure reflection or manifestation of your Being. Singing, dancing, making something
(creating) and intuition are quite often considered uninterrupted.

Now, how does all this related back to the title intuition and ego? Well, letâ€™s look at
the widely accepted public definition from the Wikipedia for Intuition :

Intuition is the ability to acquire knowledge without inference or the use of reason. [1]

Considering this, along with my interpretation above, when you intuit something you
experience pure understanding from your Being without having to translate it through the
ego. That understanding comes from pure energy. As that energy leaves the spirit (Being) it
enters the body and gets processed by the appropriate â€˜toolâ€™. If it comes
through as logical energy, it might feed the â€˜translatorâ€™ in such a way that the
energy is intellectualized so that it can be recorded or spoken. That energy may also come
through as a feeling, which, rather than being intellectualized, it is expressed through the
body.

In any case, it is energy that you share with yourself. It is a very subtle energy that many
people overlook, or undervalue, yet it is there always available for the observant.

Meditation, as it turns out, is a conscious practice where major energy components of the body
(and mind) are energetically reduced in order to allow essence of your Being shine through. As
you reduce the energy flows to places like your ego, the synchronicity of the underlying
subtle energies (like emotions) become more predominant. When the energy flows slow, the
affect is like removing all the big waves from a pond. After doing so, any small wave can be
observed and explored.

It is in these states that the Being can sense subtle energies that donâ€™t normally come
through the standard sensory paths (eyes, ears, etc.). It is in this calm that things like
intuition can be felt. Or, more importantly, the emotional energy that surrounds you. Or
even, it is in this calm that you can sense the energy of others!

Yes, that is correct. The energy that you give out influences your environment. Likewise, the
energy that others give out also influence the environment and you can pick this up just like
you sense your own energy! The problem most people experience is that they canâ€™t tell
the difference between weather itâ€™s their emotion or if itâ€™s someone
elseâ€™s emotion.

This is where intuition and ego (the translator) get involved. If you are in harmony with
yourself, you should intuitively know if the emotion is yours or not. If there is too much noise
preventing the intuitive understanding from coming through, consult the translator. The
ego is a good consultant that should be able to help you identify the source of the emotional
energy.

A couple key things that the ego and intuition show us is that at our core, the I am inside each one
of us receives and emits energy as itâ€™s form of perception and creation. We sense
energy. We have physical tools that help us sense energy. We are not simply hands and feet
(flesh and bone) but the core spirit uses energy as its key interface into our physical world.

So, even though you may not make a sound, you can still be heard.

Sending an emotion is much stronger than sending a thought.

Calming yourself helps you feel other energies.
