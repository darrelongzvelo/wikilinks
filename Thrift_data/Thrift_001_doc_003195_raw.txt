Chinese Advantages





Image:
http://advising-president-obama-2012.wikispaces.com/file/view/Great-Wallet-of-China.jpg/307234694/465x347/Great-Wallet-of-China.jpg

Trailing behind the U.S.and Japan, China has become the third largest economy in the world.
Unlike Europe and the U.S., China is now thriving. Their growth rate during the first quarter
of 2010 was at a high 11.9%. It has now surpassed the U.S. in green house production as well as
automobile sales. Right after Canada, China has become the second biggest trading partner
with the U.S. Along with the thriving economy, Chinaâ€™s military has become more
robust as well.

These economic advantages have given China more power over the U.S., demonstrated in
Obamaâ€™s visit to China in 2009. The trip was short and business like. The U.S. is
currently in debt to China which holds $877 billion of U.S. Treasury securities.

The reason for Chinaâ€™s cheap manufacturing is because they keep their currency (the
renminbi ) lower than the U.S. dollar. One of Obamaâ€™s main pleas to China is to increase
the value of their currency. He would like them to start using a floating currency system .



Hostilities

To fight back against China, the U.S.currently imposes special tariffs and duties on 95
categories of products imported from China. The U.S.has made penalties on $3.2 billion in
steel pipe from China for use in oil and gas fields. Yao Jian , ministry spokesman, stated that
the U.S.is not recognizing China as a market economy and that the U.S.is â€œacting in a
discriminatory manner.â€�

Obama has also been concerned about Chinaâ€™s violation of copyright laws and patent
rights. Although laws have been made to protect intellectual property, the making of
knock-offs of big brand names and the piracy of media is still a huge industry in China.

Image: /file/view/china_piracy0410.jpg/309954374/400x274/china_piracy0410.jpg

Obama gave a pitch to the Chinese in which he asked for â€œa positive, constructive and
comprehensive relationship that opens the door to partnership on the big global issues of our
time: economic recovery, development of clean air energy, stopping the spread of nuclear
weapons and the surge of climate change, the promotion of peace in Asia and around the
globe.â€�

However, Feng Zhong Ping , head of the European section of the Chinese Institute of
Contemporary International Relations, stated, â€œChina believes that the idea that
[China and the United States] could undertake the responsibility of administering the world
is incorrect.â€�

Officials in the U.S. believe that a trade war could erupt if the Chinese donâ€™t
evaluate the reminbi kept low in favor of Chinese exports.



Obama-China Agreements

http://advising-president-obama-2012.wikispaces.com/file/view/China_Trade.gif/306829380/365x374/China_Trade.gif

In Beijing, Obama signed 11 bilateral agreements . These agreements included: nuclear
proliferation, economic cooperation, climate change, participation in multinational
anti-pirate patrols in the Horn of Africa, visits between U.S. and Chinese forces (the U.S.
carrier USS Nimitz

visited Hong Kong in February), plus a joint commitment to strengthen people-to-people
exchanges. As part of an enlarged U.S. academic-exchange program, Obama has promised to send
100,000 American students to China

U.S. China relations (2000)

Masci, David


http://library.cqpress.com/globalresearcher/document.php?id=cqrglobal2000080400&type=hitlist&num=4

China is a growing world power, therefore they are more willing to involve themselves in
disputes with the United States, especially when it comes to Taiwan. The U.S. threatens China
over a takeover in Taiwan as it pursues independence.

In October of 1999 China threw a party to showcase their achievements in industrialization
and athletics. At this parade, they also displayed themselves as an upcoming military power
with thousands of soldiers and hundreds of military vehicles. The demonstration can be
described as: â€œThe display of military might was calculated, says James R. Lilley , a
resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute . â€˜They want us to know that
they're not going to be pushed around,â€™ he says. â€˜Their intention is clear:
neutralize American power in the region and press their territorial claimsâ€�
(Masci).

As they continue to press territorial claims, Taiwan is an imperative priority in
Chinaâ€™s scope. Because it was founded by Nationalist Party leader Chaing (former
leader of China), Taiwan was set up as a parallel state and declared to be the legitimate
government of China. The United States had always recognized Taiwan as China, until when
Nixon visited in 1972 and began to administer the American concept of democracy.

Image: /file/view/Taiwan_USA_%26_China.jpeg/309956056/Taiwan_USA_%26_China.jpeg

Now, the legitimate government of China is no longer considered Taiwan, but rests with the
Communists on the mainland. Although, the â€œ One China policy â€� suggests that
Taiwan should reunite with the mainland peacefully. Many contenders argue this:
â€œUnlike [mainland] China, Taiwan is a democracy, and we need to respect and back up
whatever decision [it] makes,â€™ says Gary Schmitt , executive director of the Project
for the New American Century , a Washington, D.C., think tank that promotes American global
leadership. That includes the right to be independent, he saysâ€� (Masci).

Schmitt believes that the United States should support Taiwan as opposed to let China take
over again. Others are hesitant to agree since China is so vital to American foreign policy.
And since so much of U.S. trade depends on China, it is dangerous to put our relationship in
jeopardy. Their military forces are growing stronger and China is a big and brutal country
that the United States has no business creating conflict with.

Now, Taiwan and the United States suggest that â€œOne Chinaâ€� means there is only
one state called China, regardless of its other governments. And because of the â€œ One
China policy â€�, Taiwan can carry on in its current state without antagonizing the
Chinese. America has supported both sides of the argument; Until Clinton rejected
Taiwanâ€™s independence in 1998. The controversy over whether to view Taiwan as its own
democracy has gradually come down to the United States supporting the â€œ One China
policy â€�.











U.S. China relations (1954)

David Stone

http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1954091500

In the past, China was completely under a communist form of government and did not ally with the
United States. To understand our present day alliance with China, one must revisit our past
ties with Red China and see the progress that has been made. At a press conference on July 7,
1954, President Eisenhower stated his views on allowing China to obtain a seat in the United
Nations, â€œâ€˜completely and unalterably opposed under the present situation to
the admission of Red China into the United Nations,â€™ and he thought that â€˜95
percent of the population of the United States would take the same standâ€™ â€�
(Stone). After

Image: /file/view/chinese-propaganda4.jpg/309956698/chinese-propaganda4.jpg
Chinese Communist Propaganda from the Mao Zedong Era Eisenhower having said this,
Americaâ€™s global policy became clear and the world knew that the US would not become
entangled with Communist affairs. On a more positive note, Eisenhower also stated that in
event of China being admitted into the United Nations, we would not secede from the
organization which is beneficial to every country. Our relations did remain hostile though
when news came out of the USâ€™s compliance to support Taiwan if the Communist China
invaded because Eisenhower wanted to continue to fight the war on communism. This created
more issues between America and China in the 50â€™s. The US would remain strong in its
promise to not feel threatened by communist countries. Britain supported the USâ€™s
stand against communism and agreed with us that China should not be admitted, even if there is a
threat or act of aggression toward the UN. America made it very clear that their admittance
into the UN would remain denied as long as China is communist.

The U.S.is a main power in the Pacific and Chinaâ€™s power is rising in the Asia Pacific

but that does not mean there is a declining power. The U.S.and China are tied when it comes to
social interest and economic well-being. The U.S.and China are similar in common interest
and military power and there are plans to join naval forces.

Chinaâ€™s military power is increasing and it must be handled responsibly or it will
lead to instability. China and U.S.need to work together and forget about the negatives from
the past and move towards the future in agreement to "free and open commerce, access to the
global commons and the peaceful resolution of conflict."

There will be disagreements and differences with China but we need to focus on the
similarities between the two countries. It is Huntsman opinion that we must take care of our
neighborhood first and then help other countries that we can and this philosophy is shared
with other politicians as well. The U.S. is struggling right now but it will regain what it had
once before.











"Romney, Business Leaders Differ on China Talk."

Metzler, Rebecca. US News

http://www.usnews.com/
news/articles/2012/02/16/romney-business-leaders-differ-on-china-talk .

Mitt Romney thinks that the U.S.has a lot to gain from being in a close relationship with China
but we need to keep in mind that China is a tyranny and could cause us many problems. He
disapproves of the President's approach with China and wants to continue our trade with
China; however, he does not want to reward them for their cheating and hurting of American
companies. Some believe that opening business in China will harm the U.S.but Donohue and Rice
said it will help create economic opportunities. This article urges the U.S. to continue
U.S.-China relations but to be smart and use moderation in order for our own protection.

The Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman opposes Mitt Romneyâ€™s view and believes that
Romney is only discussing China because he is a candidate that wonâ€™t follow up with
creating opportunities from China, just as other candidates have done. Once these
candidates are elected, these thoughts soon turn into fears, evident in Obama's
administration.

















Scholarly Articles





The United States and China in the Age of Obama: looking each other straight in the eyes. (2009)

Lampton, David M.


http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&hid=111&sid=12dc9a56-3df7-49b4-88e2-714ab838382b%40sessionmgr111&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=49236010

Now that the United States is facing other growing world powers, it is becoming less dominant
in many different ways. China is beginning to have a larger impact on many fundamentals of
foreign policy. Lampton states,â€� The United States and China now have to look each
other straight in the eyes, with the core of their relationship resting on the strategic
foundation of stabilizationâ€”stabilization of the global economy, global
ecosystem, and global securityâ€�. This article emphasizes a few major points in our
relationship with China.

-China has made domestic and foreign economic policy decisions that have a big impact on the
great economic downturn of 2007-2009. They can potentially increase chances of coming out of
the downturn.

- The United States has recently settled into a bearable relationship with the PRC, â€œin
the effort to build coalitions to address the global system's most pressing
challengesâ€�.

-Although, when dealing with specific policy demands, it will still be very unlikely for
Beijing and Washington to come to a compromise on major issues.









U.S.-China relationship in the 21st century

Sempa, Francis P.

A265487883&docType=GALE&role

JCS Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen enlightened students and professors at Renmein Universtiy
in Beijing about the importance of the United States relationship with China on July 10th,
2011. He stated that it â€œwill shape the 21st Century.â€� Chinaâ€™s rise as a
world power does not mean Americas decline in the Asia-Pacific region, as our economy and
security interests are directly related to the continent. There are areas of concern as well
as positive aspects of the growing relationship.

Positive attributions include expansions of military-to-military contacts, plans for
joint counter-piracy operations of naval forces, and â€œcommon challengesâ€�
and â€œshared interestsâ€� globally with Asia.

Although, some major areas of concern include Taiwan, the South China Seaâ€™s
competition with surrounding countries, and the presence of North Korea.

Adm. Mullen views Chinaâ€™s growing military strengths cautiously. He states that
â€œIf China does not approach its growing power in that manner, it could lead to a less
stable and secure region.â€� He believes that the two countries need to treat each other
with respect and be open to maintaining a peaceful relationship.









US Trade Deficits and Sino-US Relations

http://advising-president-obama-2012.wikispaces.com/file/view/US-China-Flag.jpg/309958714/US-China-Flag.jpg

The United States trade deficit has been blamed on Chinaâ€™s exchange rate for a number
of years now. America has been treating these trade deficits with China as a security issue,
which has become apparent in The United States relationship with Sino. China has not been
responding positively to pressure on the exchange rate. This has been making policy action
difficult to deal with, which effects plans to replenish our economy and can not be dealt with
through China alone especially with their structure of global trade and political economy.

Chinaâ€™s issue with Taiwan is also a discrepancy between the US and China because the US
is actually takingTaiwanâ€™s side. Also issues with Tibet are affecting the US and
China relationship because the US is trying to get China to put these conflicts to an end.

USCBC's mission is to expand the US-China commercial relationship to the benefit of

its membership and, the US economy. It favors constructive engagement with China to
eliminate trade and investment barriers and develop a commercial environment based on rules
that is predictable and transparent to all parties. The amount that the USCBC donates to the
federal government can vary depending on how much attention is being payed to their issue. For
example, in 2010-2011 the amount doanted decreased from $140,000 to $64,000

Federal Government Department

The US Government has recently made improvements to put more trust between China and the US.
Chinaâ€™s most up and coming political leader, Xi Jinping has met with key Federal
government officials including Obama , Biden , and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta . The
Foreign ministry official, Liu Weimin , official stated â€œChina and the US should
â€˜calmly and objectivelyâ€™ evaluate each other's strategic intentions in
order to enhance trustâ€� (Hodge). The US Department of Defense has recently refocused
military attention to the Asia-Pacific area based on nuclear developments making tensions
between the two countries

rise. However, during the Bush administration , relations were softened and Bush wanted to be
engaged with China for trade and military purposes and there was not as much of a threat. The
Department of Treasury is also keeping close ties with China because we are in extreme debt,
owing them 1.7 trillion dollars, creating extreme dependency on the world 3rd largest
economy. The Department of Commerce has pushed for good relations with China because we
obtain the majority of our goods from there and engage in a lot of commerce and as China rises as a
global super power, so does our dependence on them. As election year is closing in on both the US
and China (every 10 years) this year, a trustworthy relationship is necessary to build our
economy and military welfare.















Supreme Court Cases





Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (2012)

http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/kiobel


http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/us/supreme-court-debates-human-rights-case-against-companies.html?_r=1

This case is a lawsuit brought against Royal Dutch Petroleum Co ., Shell Transport & Trading
Co., and brought to attention on behalf of Dr. Kiobel , a leader of the Ogoni people in Nigeria.
Kiobel fights for damages and reliefs against crimes of humanity, including torture and
extradition for the Nigerian people.

Image: /file/view/s16-348x250.jpg/309960016/s16-348x250.jpg The case was scheduled to
be heard in front of the Supreme Court on February 28, 2012. While this involves Nigerian
people working for an American company, it is relevant to US and China relations because we
have recently accused China or breaking humanitarian rights in their work places. We do a lot
of trade with them and hope to increase fairer working conditions within Chinese factories by
portraying our concern against unfair wages, health hazards and treatment of workers. If
this case has an outcome of protecting the Nigerians, then it will set a standard against the
Chinese treating their workers poorly and allow American companies to care for the workers
better.







CompuServe Incorporated v. Patterson (1990)

http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2010/gb20100113_124533.htm

http://kwc.org/memorylane/tjhsst/fapage/cases.html

This court case is a land mark in internet rights in America. It was one of the first cases
dealing with material that is published online and who is responsible for it and if everyone
should be able to see it. In the end, the Supreme Court ruled for the internet services under
protection from the first amendment . This is a parallel to what was developing in China the
last few years.

The US Supreme Court upholds our privileges to free speech and no censorship . However, this is
not true in China. Google, an American company was debating if they should keep providing
their services there while it is being censored by the Chinese government. Our relations with
China were affected by this situation because the two countries are clashing with their
ideals and civil rights that are provided. The founders of Google started to fight against the
government in hopes of changing the Chinese censorship laws. In Americaâ€™s eyes,
knowledge is essential and we have no fear of allowing all to have the freedom of speech and
press. In the end, this case is important in showing that the US has no laws of censorship or
publishing on the internet and these laws will start to rub off on China with the Google
situation and as our ties become closer.







Lau v. Nichols (1974)

<http://www.pbs.org/beyondbrown/brownpdfs/launichols.pdf>

In 1971, the San Francisco California school system had about 2800 Chinese Ancestry students
speaking no English. Only about 1000 of these students were receiving the supplemental
English courses that they needed, and the students not receiving additional

help filed a class action lawsuit against the San Francisco United School District, arguing
that it violated their 14th Amendment rights . They discovered that the California Education
Code required English to be the basic language of instruction in all schools, Although
according to the Supreme court, "these standards did not provide for equality of treatment".
Because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Chinese
speaking students and assured equal opportunity to all students in the same school system,
declaring that discrimination would not be tolerated by the school districts.















Obama's Position

"Barack Obama." Council on Foreign Relations .

http://www.cfr.org/experts/world/barack-obama/b11603#10



Obama likes the relationship with China to be strong but he understands that China is a huge
competitor for the US. He said in a debate in 2007 that China is â€œNeither our enemy nor our
friend. Theyâ€™re competitors. But we have to make sure that we have enough military to
military contact and forge enough of a relationship with them that we can stabilize the
region.â€� Obama has said that even though we are trying to create a cooperative
relationship with China we still need to be clear with China on the parts where we disagree.
Obama also urges China to fix relations with Tibet and Obama sent a letter to Bush in 2008 to
encourage Bush to have the Chinese president and the Dalai Lama to resolve issues and give
Tibetan people freedom. The people of China should feel positive about the election of Ma
Ying-jeou in the eyes of Obama. China needs to recognize that their economy is very big now and
China must act like it. There are international rules that China and other countries involved
in trade must follow.

























Critical Analysis

It is clear that China as a whole is currently at an advantage over the United States. They have
so much more power over us: their ability to produce goods cheaply and efficiently, our
extremely high importation of their goods compared to their low importation of our goods, and
our substantially high debt owed to them. While Chinaâ€™s economy is thriving, our
economy is crumbling. With China on the rise, and with the U.S. on the downfall, it is easy for
China to assume a superior position.

In the future, it is most likely that China will become the largest exporter in the world and our
economy will become flooded with a plethora of Chinese goods. But how can we compete with them?
Our past with them has been shaky and the only way we can improve the state of our economy is by
repairing our current relations.

/file/view/CHINESE-TAKE-OVER---1.png/309957844/493x313/CHINESE-TAKE-OVER---1.png

The U.S. and China relationship has been present since Richard Nixon â€™s visit to China
in 1972. Nixon signed the Shanghai Joint CommuniquÃ© making Taiwan part of China. Ford also
visited China but nothing came of it; although, in 1978, China received a new paramount leader
named Deng Xiaoping who created reform in economics and in western relationships. In 1979,
the US passed the Taiwan Relations Act and America promised to keep U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
In this same year, Reagan went to China and the Prime minister of China came to the U.S. for the
first time. Just as most other presidents, President Bush also made a visit to China, likewise
by Li Xiannian , the Chinese president, who visited America in 1985. In 1989 the Tiananmen
Square massacre occurred as a result of pro-democracy protests. The U.S. responded to this by
providing Taiwan with F-16 warplanes; this was not well received by China. Angered by this,
China sent missiles for testing towards Taiwan but the U.S. sent aircraft carriers to support
Taiwan. After all this going on in 1996, a year later, Jiang Zemin became the first Chinese
president to visit the U.S. in 15 years. Clinton then went to China, being the first U.S.
president to go to China since the Tiananmen Square massacre . In 1999, the U.S. bombed
Yugoslavia . During this bombing, the People's Republic of China Embassy in Belgrade was hit,
killing 3 Chinese reporters. The U.S. apologized to China and claimed that the NATO bombings
were not directed in any way towards them. However, the Chinese did not accept this apology and
Anti-American protests exploded in China. Then just two years later, a U.S. spy plane
collided with a Chinese pilot which put the U.S.-China relationship on the edge yet again.
After this, Bush and Jiang traveled back and forth between China and the U.S. a few times. But it
was a different visit when the Premier Wen Jiabao visited the White House and Bush publically
scolded the president of Taiwan for infuriating Beijing. During his administration , Obama
has visited China and has tried to set the relationship straight after all the bumps along the
way. Not much has been done in the past that has improved our relations with China in any way. If
anything, the U.S.'s past experiences with China has worsened their relationship. The
intensity of the situation is severe because the U.S.'s economy is directly affected by the
economy of China. Without them, they would crumble. The U.S. has always been a power over China
but as of now, they have become an equal (if not a superior force) apparent in their
skyrocketing economy. This new-found power now acts as a challenge towards the U.S. China can
now use this power to manipulate them, to force them to do their bidding. What Obama can do in his
next 2 years is ensure that China's superiority complex does not allow them to bully the U.S.
However, Obama must keep a level of respect towards China, for they are now the real ones in
power. This balance of power is the biggest struggle for relations between the U.S. and China.















Recommendation to the President



In regards to the U.S. and their relationship with China, the U.S. should recognize that
petitioning the World Trade Organization and criticizing Chinaâ€™s currency is only
making China see their trading abilities as a weapon in the battle for China to take over the US
as a world power. A war for both countries on trade would be extremely harmful to both sides. The
U.S. should not take anything else from China because it is only giving China more power and
pushing China away from a Democracy . The U.S. should try to clearly show the Chinese what they
can do to better their country. For example, intellectual property theft, like downloading
programs illegally, is hurting their own country and putting a stop to it would put both the
U.S. and China in a better place. Although China is currently stronger than the U.S.
economically, our democracy is still strong and our individual rights set us apart. If the
U.S. can just try and focus on discussing human rights and fair laws that can benefit both the
people and the government with China, change may be possible. If the U.S. gives something
useful to China then China can help the U.S. in North Korea and Iran ; this is desperately needed
right now because the state of the U.S. economy is weak in comparison to that of China's.

Military connections for both countries are beneficial for China and the U.S. Obama needs to
try and get China on board for the fight against terrorism because that is a big threat to the
U.S. and with China's new bolstered army, they would be of great assistance. China needs to be
an official connection. The U.S. cannot keep ties with China if they are not willing to commit;
America cannot currently handle an unreliable ally.

Obama plans to open Chinese business markets for the U.S. businesses and this is a very good
plan because it will create money and jobs for Americans. When this is done, China should
create a fair competition and create laws for Chinese and American companies. Another vital
way of boosting the U.S.'s own economy is by increasing the value of the renminbi , which China
keeps lower than the value of the U.S. dollar. One of Obamaâ€™s main pleas to China should
be to increase the value of their currency and to start using a floating currency system . The
reason for China's cheap and highly efficient manufacturing business is in direct relation
to their currency. If Obama can increase its value, the U.S. may stand a fighting chance
against these waves of cheap Chinese goods. Increasing the value of the renminbi would
evidently result in the stimulation of the U.S. economy. This would mean that the U.S. would
not be as flooded with foreign goods and would be able to produce more of our own goods. If Obama
can do this, it would have huge positive impacts for his administration and reelection would
be certain.
