And why does a top hedge fund manager &quot;earn&quot; enough to pay for thousands of teachers?</p>\n                    <p>Is there a trade-off between meaning and money?

Can it be resolved?</p>\n                    <p>There is indeed a stark, sharp, gigantic trade-off between meaning and money in our so-called brain-dead shell-game Ponzi-scheme of an &quot;economy.&quot;</p>\n                    <p>But there shouldn\'t be.</p>\n                    <p>\n                      In a &quot;working&quot; economy, one should gain a sense of meaning from\none\'s work when one makes a lasting, visible difference; and when\none makes a difference, one should be rewarded for (and in\nproportion with) it. Now, in the name of dynamism and\naccomplishment, one probably shouldn\'t be guaranteed a fortune\ndoing what one loves; I don\'t suggest that every wannabe Hemingway\nand Picasso should be raking in the bucks like a mega-banker. But\nthe fact that it seems nearly impossible to build a stable, secure,\nhappy life in the segment formerly known as the &quot;middle class&quot; by\ndoing worthwhile work that makes a real human difference is the\nexception that proves the rule, illuminating just how deeply, and\nperhaps fatally broken our economy is.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      You and I face the difficult choice of trading meaning for\nmoney; we weigh the searing moments of real human accomplishment\nagainst the soul-sucking &quot;work&quot; of earning the next car payment by\npolishing up another meaningless PowerPoint deck packed with\ntactics to win games whose net result is the creation of little of\nreal value for much of anyone who\'s not a sociopath. This is the\ndeepest kind of theft; not merely prosperity having been looted\nfrom societies, but significance having been stolen from human\nlives.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Yet, the unforgiving truth is: the trade-off between meaning and\nmoney is as real \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and as toxic, as characteristic of our\npost-prosperity present, and as strikingly intensifying \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d as\nclimate change. And, like climate change, while you can argue that\nit\'s existed throughout history, to do so is a weak argument; so\nhas, say, human trafficking.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      In the simplest sense, the very point of a &quot;capitalist&quot; economy\nis to\n                      <em>minimize</em>\n                      the trade-off between meaning and money.\nSo, for example, you and I don\'t have to spend a lifetime building,\nstone by stone, a Great Wall or a Pyramid \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d to satisfy the whim of\nan Emperor or a Pharaoh \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and so burn through our one invaluable\nprecious life. Every life has worth; and because it has worth, so\nit must seek, and discover, meaning.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      So what can you do about it? There\'s only one good answer, and\nit\'s simple. Stop trading meaning for money. It\'s the worst trade\nyou\'ll ever make. But the truth is, you and I are encouraged to\nmake the worst trade in the world from the second we\'re socialized\n\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d from school &quot;counselors&quot; who exhort us to settle for the safe; to\nschlock-and-awe advertising that lamely attempts to brainwash us\ninto buying our way out of emptiness and self-loathing; to &quot;jobs&quot;\nthat reward us for extinguishing what\'s good, noble, and true in\nus. Perhaps it\'s no exaggeration, in short, to suggest: our way of\nwork, life, and play revolves around hundreds of millions of\npeople, billions of times a day, trading meaning for money \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d so, of\ncourse, the next hour, day, week, and money, they can furiously,\neagerly, desperately spend large amounts of money trying to buy\ntiny morsels of meaning.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Consider, for a moment, what noted economist Richard Easterlin\nhas\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/09/easterlin-when-growth-outpaces-happiness.html" shape="rect"> recently found</a>\n                      : that as China has gotten notably richer, its\nhappiness has followed a U-shaped curve: first declining, then\nascending \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d but never ascending past its previous, historic,\npoverty-ridden peaks. While I don\'t pretend societies should be\nheld hostage to &quot;happiness&quot; as the only end of life \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d to be sure, a\nfull, rich life is in every sense larger and wholer than a merely\nhappy one \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps this now-familiar research demonstrates a truth\nthat I\'d bet, deep down, most of us don\'t just\n                      <em>know</em>\n                      , but\nfeel, live, and breathe: that while we\'ve become proficient at\nattaining riches, while the pursuit of material wealth is now\nsomething like the application of a well-worn formula, living lives\nrich not just with megabucks, but with meaning\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/haque/2011/12/mastering_the_art_of_living_me.html" shape="rect"> remains elusive, enigmatic, difficult</a>\n                      .\n                    </p>\n                    <p>And yet a life without meaning is like a day that never breaks.</p>\n                    <p>\n                      But when I say, &quot;stop trading meaning for money&quot;, I emphatically\n                      <em>don\'t</em>\n                      mean we should do the opposite: start trading money\nfor meaning. Instead, we must detonate this toxic trade-off \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d for\nwhile it might not irreparably poison our lives, it surely will\ndiminish, reduce, and wither the worth of our limitless\npotential.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Step out of your shadow, the carefully constructed almost-self\nyou\'ve been instructed, encouraged, cajoled to settle for.

It\'s up to you not just to\nreject and refuse those dilemma-ridden choices \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d but to rebel\nagainst them and forge better opportunities; above all, the\nopportunities that make up a life worth living; the stuff of\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/haque/2011/05/is_a_well_lived_live_worth_anything.html" shape="rect"> eudaimonia</a>\n                      \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d a life that matters because it\'s been lived\nmeaningfully well.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      This is what the unbending arc of human potential never stops\nasking of each and every one of us.

Any\nfool with an empty wallet, a gimlet eye, and an emptier head can\nsell his soul; just as any dilettante can trade meaning for money,\nand glorify themselves as a starving artist. The greater challenge\nin any life isn\'t merely extracting the highest price for your\nsoul; nor safeguarding your soul while opportunities pass you by \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut earning, with the coin of mattering,\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/haque/2012/01/create_a_meaningful_life_throu.html" shape="rect"> a life that has counted in the terms that make us not merely &quot;rich&quot;, but whole, worthy of the privilege of having lived</a>\n                      .\n                    </p>\n                    <p>Let me put that in real-world terms.</p>\n                    <p>You\'re 25.

TSA has limited resources to passengers, so they\nshould focus on the unfamiliar, who are less predictable and more\nthreatening. And since frequent travelers experience the most\nfrustration with TSA delays, changing their experience with\nsecurity procedures is likely to have the most impact on\nperceptions of the TSA and their function.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      But there are some unexpected consequences in making security\nmore pleasant for frequent travelers.

Consider: James\nwasn\'t getting a big bonus, a company award-cum-paperweight, or\nstock options: the stock answers in trade of management gurus who\nwish to &quot;motivate&quot; worker drones. So what was James getting?\nPerhaps something like the joy of accomplishment or the fun of the\nchallenge \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d prizes that money, in point of fact, can\'t buy. And he\ncould pursue those higher-order rewards \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and in the pursuit of\nthose rewards, create something singularly worthwhile for me \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d\nbecause, simply, vitally, he was free to do so. At most\nMcStitutions, the idea that a &quot;valued team member&quot; would be free to\nact sans script, formula, or routine, is about as likely as the\nidea that you\'re really a giant pink inflatable Godzilla named\n&quot;Marmaduke.&quot; Look, think about it this way: every internet dating\nprofile in the world begs for some spontaneity \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d not just because\nit\'s exciting, but because formula never led anywhere but to the\nsame old stale, yawn-inducing answer: the one you probably broke up\nwith last month. Spontaneity is the act of human potential\nunfurling in the moment \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and if it\'s human potential you wish to\nignite, then it\'s spontaneity you need to spark.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <strong>Synchronicity.</strong>\n                      One common misinterpretation of\nmanagement theory goes thus: pit your best people against one\nanother, like dogs in a fight, and the wondrous power of\n&quot;competition&quot; will unleash vital energies heretofore unseen in the\nhistory of great endeavor. Taking a hard look at the organizations\nthat practice this style of management-by-Mordor, my guess is that\nthe unbridled exaltation of aggression is more like the express\ntrain to Sociopath City. Just look at investment banks.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      In point of fact, what distinguishes organizations that achieve\nenduring greatness is\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://hbr.org/special-collections/insight/collaboration" shape="rect">teamwork and collaboration</a>\n                      \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and those are words so overused, they make\nmy teeth ache just saying them. Here\'s my bet: it\'s time to drop\nthe fourth wall of the &quot;team&quot; \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and go beyond collaboration, to\nsomething like what Jung called synchronicity: a kind of uncanny\nintersection of seemingly unrelated lives. At Kaffeine, I became\nsomething more than a customer, and something more like a team\nmember: the barista wasn\'t working &quot;for&quot; me, to dully serve up\nanother tedious, formulaic, McCoffee: he was, working with me, to\ncraft a coffee that benefitted me not just in the sense that I\nneeded a shot of caffeine, but in real human terms; a mini-coffee\nthat fit the fact that I needed a tiny jolt to finish my book \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and\nin that moment, we were were synced up; on the &quot;same team&quot;, so to\nspeak; not just slack-jawed &quot;consumer&quot; at odds with distant, aloof\n(or perhaps unscrupulous, read-the-fine-print-of-the-fine-print)\n&quot;producer.&quot;\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <strong>Solubility.</strong>\n                      But the biggest lesson \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and the\none hidden in plain sight \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d is this: creating institutions capable\nof not just solving the same old problems, forever. All too often,\nI hear the furious debate of problems already long-ago solved.\nConsider the curious case of profitability. Little is more\nintensely, heatedly discussed in boardrooms \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d but the truth is that\nprofits have never been higher, both in real terms or as a share of\nGDP. Profit is a solved problem: we know, to a pretty good\napproximation, how to make companies profitable (at least in the\nshort run, for the benefit of shareholders, often to the detriment\nof, well, everyone and everything else). Now, I don\'t mean that\nyou, the struggling entrepreneur, face no challenges \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d but I do\nmean that having read a few books, spoken to a few mentors, and\ncrunched a few numbers, probably have a shot at applying a set of\nwell-worn lessons that, should the fates smile on you, lead you to\nthe promised land of profitability.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      This is also true at the very micro and the very macro level.\nFor instance,\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://hbr.org/web/management-tip/tips-on-meetings" shape="rect">we know</a>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://hbr.org/1976/03/how-to-run-a-meeting/ar/1" shape="rect">how to</a>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/tjan/2009/06/the-key-to-shorter-better-meet.html" shape="rect"> run a</a>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://hbr.org/product/guide-to-making-every-meeting-matter/an/10755-SBC-ENG" shape="rect"> meeting</a>\n                      , but as any office worker will tell you, instances of\neffectively run meetings are vanishingly scarce. To take a very\nmacro, economy-wide example, look at productivity. Though it\'s\noften still hotly debated hither and thither, the truth is that\n(simple) productivity, like profitability, is something like a\nsolved problem. Work fewer people harder, with faster, smarter\nrobots \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and hey, presto: productivity. And that seems to be,\nsometimes, our entirely inadequate recipe for national prosperity \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d\none destined to doom the middle class to even more striking levels\nof hardship and penury.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      James, remarkably, was solving an unsolved problem.

Institutions that are capable of taking a hard look at\nunsolved problems around the globe \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d as big as climate change,\nsending humans to Mars, and redesigning the global financial\nsystem, and as small as Umair\'s perfect coffee \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d and then accepting\nthe difficult, often painful, always fulfilling, work of attempting\nto solve them. Call this property, if you like, &quot;solubility.&quot; You\nknow how our political parties are &quot;debating&quot;...pretty much exactly\nwhat they were in 1980? That\'s insolubility: institutions stuck,\nlike glue, on the same old (readily solvable) problems \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d instead of\nlooking unflinchingly into the unresolved, hazy future, and\nresolutely pioneering it.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Sure \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d it might seem laughably preposterous to read the future\nof prosperity into the creamy foam topping an Umair (hey, that\'s\nwhat my coffee\'s called, remember?). Yet, if the question is &quot;Where\ndo tomorrow\'s institutions come from?&quot; my answer is: from today\'s\npioneers. Go ahead and burn me at the stake, but I\'d advance the\nheretical idea that yes, even a humble barista just might be\nlight-years ahead of our so-called visionary leaders when it comes\nto the art of reimagining the epic facepalm of a fail that you and\nI currently call the status quo.

So Jase built a website called Neighbor.ly, and asked his\nfriends and neighbors to\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://neighbor.ly/kc-streetcar" shape="rect">help him raise $10 million towards the project</a>\n                      .\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      I don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t know if Jase is going to succeed \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c given that he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s only\nraised a few thousand dollars so far, it seems pretty unlikely. But\nI\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m paying attention to Jase\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s experiment, because I think he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s one\nof the pioneers experimenting with what I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m calling internet-native\ncivics. Whether Jase succeeds or fails, his experiment raises the\nquestion: How do people who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve grown up using the internet engage\nin civic life? I see great potential and great possible harm from\nsome of these experiments. I worry we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re heading uncritically\ntowards a different way of conceiving of the civic relationships\nbetween individuals and governments. But I also think that if we\ncan figure out how to harness these internet-based forms of civic\nengagement, we might revitalize political participation.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a worthwhile critique of discussions about the internet\nand civic engagement that asks why we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d impute any special powers\nto a communication medium. I agree that we are oversimplifying\nsituations when we declare that Facebook overthrew Mubarak or that\nChinese authoritarianism cannot survive the rise of Weibo\nmicroblogging services. But it would also be a mistake not to take\nseriously the role of new communications media in understanding\ncivic life. In democratic states, citizens need information about\nwhat challenges a government faces and what it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s proposing to do\nabout it to be effective citizens. And citizens need to be able to\nconnect with one another to discuss, debate and propose solutions.\nWhat a communications medium makes possible has a shaping influence\non civic life.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      In the United States, the government made an investment early on\nin a technology designed to connect citizens so they could govern\nthemselves. This wasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t the internet, but the postal system,\nestablished in the US Constitution, and implemented in a way that\nencouraged citizens to use the mails, the connective technology of\nthe time, as a civic space. The postal system subsidized the\ndistribution of newspapers, allowing newspaper publishers to trade\n\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93exchange copies\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd with other publishers at no cost, a phenomenon\nwhich meant content was often reprinted, with a paper in one state\noffering perspectives from a distant city. It cost so much less to\nsend a newspaper than a private letter that frugal correspondents\nsometimes composed letters by placing pinpricks under words in\nnewspaper articles. With costs of newspapers so low, many Americans\nsubscribed to several papers, reading news and opinion from\nmultiple political and geographic perspectives. (I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m leaning\nheavily on\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~starr/CreationoftheMedia/Media.html" shape="rect">Paul Starr\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93The Creation of the Media\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd</a>\n                      here, both for the\nhistorical events and the core insight on media structure and\ndemocratic process.)\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      As the structure of the media industry changed, we see some\nparallel changes in politics. The rise of advertising as a major\nsource of newspaper revenue, replacing subscription, encouraged\nnewspapers to move from partisan, opinionated organs to \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93objective\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd\npapers that sought to report events in a way to attract readers of\nall political persuasions. Papers increased in size and began\ncovering more national and international events, relying on reports\nvia telegraph to provide information, and published less opinion\ncontent. This shift from a multifaceted party press, with a great\ndeal of local color and opinion, to a more nationally focused press\ncoincides with the rise of a strong two party system and the\nlessening of local influence over political platforms. As broadcast\nmedia, and especially television, become dominant media forms,\npolitics becomes synchronized nationally. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s no longer possible\nto speak one way in one region, and differently in another \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c pander\nto segregationists in the South and you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll be seen by an audience\nin the North as well. My friend\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/06/22/1461444810365313.abstract" shape="rect"> danah boyd refers to \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93unseen audiences\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd in her work on social media</a>\n                      \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c young people writing to their friends on Facebook\naren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t always cognizant of future employers, who might read their\nposts. Politicians quickly became aware of these unseen audiences\nand changed their rhetoric to appeal to these wider audiences.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      This change has helped stamp out some of the peculiarities and\nquirks of US politics. Even within a two-party system, we had\npolitical parties that had regional variations: Dixiecrats were\nreliably democratic, but far from progressive on issues of racial\njustice, while the Northeast featured a now extinct species of\npolitician, the socially moderate, fiscally conservative\nRepublican. (I miss them. Such lovely plumage.) Broadcast media has\nhelped act as a synchronizing function, allowing party leaders to\ndemand their candidates stay in line with party values, whatever\nlocal sensibilities might otherwise dictate. Being declared outside\nthe mainstream of a party is the kiss of death. Once Lincoln\nChafee, a decidedly quirky Rhode Island liberal Republican, was\ndeclared a RINO \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Republican In Name Only\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c his political career\nwas over, even though his stances might have been acceptable to\nlocal voters. The end result is two deeply polarized parties, each\nwith a deep geographic base and a largely unshakeable platform,\nwith very little incentive to talk with the other.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Another effect of the rise of broadcast media is a rise in\nfiscal costs of politics. Television is very expensive, which turns\npolitical campaigns into fundraising contests. For years, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s been\nroutine to report on political campaigns by comparing how much\nmoney each candidate has raised. Now the game has taken on a new\ndimension with the Citizens United ruling, which gives corporations\nthe same rights as individuals to spend in elections, and has\ncreated a new category of SuperPACs, designed to work on behalf of\na candidate, but not \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93in coordination\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd with that candidate. Thus\nfar, the 2012 campaign is shaping up to be one of the nastier\ncampaigns in recent memory, focused less on the issues and more on\nthe personal shortcomings of each candidate. (And, while I support\nPresident Obama, I fear his campaign may actually be nastier than\nthe Romney campaign thus far.)\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Legal scholar Larry Lessig suggests we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re in an age of corporate\ncapture of American politics, a form of corruption so deep that\nthere\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s no alternative but to strike at the root: public financing\nfor campaigns, end of corporate personhood. He may be right. But\nthere\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s another school of thought that sees an evolution of\npolitics in parallel with a shift in dominant media. As we move\ntowards participatory, internet-based media, perhaps we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re moving\ntowards a newly participatory, internet-based democracy.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      This idea surfaced in a big way during the Howard Dean campaign\nin 2004. Dean was a democratic candidate for president in 2004, and\nwhile he fell far short of the nomination, he captured the\nimagination of a large group of tech-savvy activists, who saw an\nopportunity to build a political platform and policy proposals\nonline. That participatory energy was harnessed well by Barack\nObama in 2008, who asked suporters to focus their efforts not on\ndeveloping policy proposals, but on promoting his candidacy. Obama\nbuilt a massive email list, which allowed him to raise huge sums of\nmoney through small contributions. But once he got elected, it was\nless clear that his presidency would feature online participation.\nAn early experiment to set priorities for the administration for\nthe first 100 days of the presidency invited supporters to propose\nhigh priority issues. When online voters pushed marijuana\nlegalization to the top of the stack, Obama made it clear that he\nwasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t going to be unduly influenced by this online input. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s\ncertainly possible that other forms of online deliberation will\nhave an influence in American politics, but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s far from obvious\nthat collaborative authoring of legislation (as with the effort to\nwrite alternatives to SOPA/PIPA) will be embraced by those in\npower. And these systems tend to fall victim to capture by those\nwho are the most articulate or the most persistent, who are able to\nout-talk others through skill or relentlessness.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      If collective deliberation hasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t sharply transformed politics,\nperhaps access to government data will. The Obama administration\ncommitted to policies of opening government data, with\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/05/open-government-reboot-focuses-on-apis-instead-of-data/" shape="rect"> mixed reviews</a>\n                      .

There have\nbeen some impressive victories in the space, like the exposure of\nfamily members working for pay on political campaigns, allowing a\npolitician\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s family to benefit financially from political\ndonations. While these data sets and tools are deeply useful for\npolitical junkies and to journalists, they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t seem to be\nreaching the general public.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysociety.org/" shape="rect">MySociety</a>\n                      , a UK-based\nopen government firm headed by Tom Steinberg, approaches the\nproblem of engaging the public with government data from a\ndifferent perspective. While Steinberg and his colleagues are\ndeeply interested in and engaged with public data, they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t\nassume that their users are. Instead, they offer tools like\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysociety.org/for-councils/fixmystreet/" shape="rect">FixMyStreet</a>\n                      ,\nwhich allows individuals to take a photograph of things that need\nfixing in their neighborhood and upload the images and coordinates\nto the site. This allows FixMyStreet to provide local governments\nwith a map of complaints, but the real aim of the system is more\nsubtle: it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s designed to teach users how to be powerful and\neffective citizens. When your complaint of a pothole doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t lead\nto rapid repair, FixMyStreet contacts you, reminds you that the\nissue is still outstanding and suggests what you might do to get a\nresponse, escalating the complaint up the local government\nhierarchy.\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fixmytransport.com/" shape="rect">FixMyTransport</a>\n                      goes a step\nfurther and suggests that you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re unlikely to fix many transit\nproblems unless you and others in your neighborhood form groups to\nlobby for systemic change\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0 and then introduces you to others in\nyour neighborhood interested in these issues. What looked like a\nsimple, user-friendly tool to enable you to report a problem\nbecomes an introductory course in civics, with a focus on who need\nto nag, pressure and embarrass to achieve change.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      One of the pioneers in civics education in the US is\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Graham" shape="rect">Senator Bob Graham</a>\n                      .\nGraham spent a life in public service, as a state legislator,\ngovernor and finally as one of the state\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s two senators, and with\n38 years of public service, he knows a thing or two about how\ngovernment works. Graham has dedicated his retirement to helping\nstudents understand civics and become engaged citizens. His book,\n\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93America, the Owner\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Manual\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd is a thoughtful course in civics\ndesigned for the contemporary college student. Each of ten chapters\nstarts with a story in which young people are able to accomplish\nchange through a different set of tactics, then outlines the steps\nyou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d need to take to understand the government well enough to know\nwho to influence, how to marshall facts and test the waters of\npublic opinion, and to influence policymakers.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      I read the book on the flight from Boston to northern Florida to\nmeet with the director of the\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bobgrahamcenter.ufl.edu/" shape="rect">Bob Graham Center at the University of Florida</a>\n                      , and realized that was caught between two\nreactions. On the one hand, I thought Graham\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s book was one of the\nbest introductions to civics I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d read, and I wanted to share it\nwith as many people as possible. My other impulse was to declare\nthe book completely unrealistic, impractical and out of touch with\na moment in time where American politics seems to be irretrievably\nbroken.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Several of Graham\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s examples involve influencing Congress, a\nbody that now faces a 13% approval rating. As recently as two\ndecades ago, congressional approval was near 70%. What\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s changed?\nPartisan divides are so sharp that cooperation seems impossible,\nand abuse of the senate\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s filibuster and hold rules has slowed the\nlegislative process to a crawl. The situation is so bad that the\ngovernment came within days of defaulting on treasury debt payments\ndue to congressional intransigence. And this is the body Graham\nwould like young people to influence to seek change?\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      The rise of four popular movements suggests that activists to\nthe left and the right aren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t looking to Congress for change.\nConsider these four groups \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c the Tea Party, the Occupy Movement,\nAnonymous and Wikileaks. The Tea Party begins from the assumption\nthat government is bound to screw things up, and that eliminating\ngovernment or blocking its effectiveness is the best citizens can\nhope for. Heavily influenced by anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist,\nmany Tea Party activists cheered the near-default on treasury\nbills. Default would make it harder for the government to borrow,\nwhich would force government to contract through a strategy called\n\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93starve the beast\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd. If we don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t permit taxes to rise and insist on\neliminating deficits, government will have to shrink.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Occupy has more global currency despite US origins, because the\ntargets of the movement are inherently global: they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re\nmultinational corporations and larger systems of capitalism.\nInspired by frustration with bank bailouts and the perception that\npolitical influence is no longer in the hands of citizens, some of\nthe most interesting work of the movement has been creating\ncommunities that are functioning independent of the existing state.\nThey accept Lessig\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s critique of corporate capture of the political\nprocess, but while they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re criticizing corporate personhood and\ncorruption, they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re also trying to build alternative models on\nsmall scales, in individual encampments.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Wikileaks, to the extent that it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s an ideology and movement,\nrather than the struggles of Julian Assange against extradition,\nhas focused on the idea that governments rely on secrecy to\noperate. Removing this secrecy will spark an immune reaction that\nwill not just right the specific wrongs uncovered, but will change\nthe entire system, either by prompting rebellion and demands for\nfairer government, or through a complex immune-system reaction\nwhere the system becomes so paranoid, it destroys itself. (Here I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m\nrelying on Aaron Bady\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s reading of an early Assange essay to posit\nan agenda to explain individual Wikileaks campaigns.)\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to know if Anonymous has a fixed mission, or just a\nmethod: using the internet to attack, embarrass and call attention\nto wrongs in the world. Given Anon\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s tendency to do things \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93for the\nlulz\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd and to condemn the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93moralfags\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd for being too concerned with\npolitics, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s always dangerous to pin a single philosophy on the\nmovement. But many participants see themselves as engaged in a\ncivic movement that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s making meaningful progress on the important\nissues of the day, including copyright and repression of free\nspeech.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      What these four movements have in common is that they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re not\nabout civics as usual. In conventional civics, we define a problem,\nfigure out who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s got the ability to change it, marsall support for\nour movement and persuade the decisionmakers to make a change.\nThat\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not what these groups are looking for. The Tea Party wants\nthose systems to shrink to the point of disfunctionality, removing\nproblems from the realm of government and leaving them for\nindividuals, NGOs and corporations to solve. Occupy seems deeply\ndivided on whether it makes sense to try to influence existing\nsystems of power, or to build new forms of power. Wikileaks and\nAnonymous see power as being located within media, not existing\npolitical systems, so they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re unlikely to pick loci of influence\nthat are similar to those used by Bob Graham or Tom Steinberg.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      When I work with activists around the world, I ask them to think\nthrough some of the same questions Graham asks: what is it you\nwant, and who would you need to influence to achieve that change?\nOnce you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve got a theory of change, tactics tend to fall into\nplace. In my discussions, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m seeing four primary theories of\nchange at work.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      The one Senator Graham is most focused on is a legislative\ntheory of change. Assume that we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re working to achieve full rights\nfor gays and lesbians. In an open society, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d pass legislation\nprohibiting discrimination based on sexuality, enabling gay\nmarriage, etc. It might be a hard push, but once the law was on the\nbooks, we wouldn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t have to fight individual battles. In the US,\nmost human rights organizations tend to work on this level, which\nmeans their preferred tactics involve court cases to challenge bad\nlegislation and influencing legislators to pass good\nlegislation.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Passing a law so that your pothole gets filled isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t the right\nsolution to the problems Tom Steinberg is interested in. There, you\nneed to find someone in a position of power and urge them to work\non your behalf. This can work within complex governmental systems\nand in non-governmental systems \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c if you want a company to provide\ndomestic partnership benefits for gay workers, even if you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve not\npassed the legislation at a national level, you might have success\npersuading the CEO. And in closed societies, influencing authority\nfigures may be the only theory of change that consistently works,\nas legislation may be selectively enforced. We can influence\nauthority figures through lobbying, through petitions and through\npressure campaigns, including boycotts and buycotts, as well as\nthrough mobilizing media attention.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      What if you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t just want gay and lesbian people to have the\nright to work and to marry? What if you actually want people to\nlike and accept them? You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re likely to work for cultural change,\nseeking positive portrayals of gays and lesbians in the news and in\nentertainment media. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s helpful to have legislation passed and to\nget authority figures to say the right things, but cultural change\ntends to be a media-driven theory of change, designed to slowly win\nover the hearts and minds of millions.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m seeing lots of activism these days that recognizes that it\nmay take a long time to change laws, the attitudes of people in\nauthority or the culture as a whole. In the meantime, can we\nprovide services to people in harm\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s way? If gay youth are at risk\nof bullying, depression and suicide, we might provide hotlines and\nbuild support groups. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to scale this work, but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a\ndeeply satisfying and practical way of working, fixing addressable\nproblems in a community. Whether or not our work sets an example\nfor other communities, it was worth doing.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      (Two interesting places I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m seeing the service theory of change\nat work: Occupy, and in Russia. Occupy encampments found themselves\nworking closely with local homeless populations, and often\nproviding food, shelter and some counseling services. In Russia,\npoor government response to forest fires in the summer of 2010 led\nto\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/03/russia-crowdsourcing-assistance-for-victims-of-wildfires/" shape="rect"> a volunteer movement</a>\n                      to fill cars with food, clothes and\nblankets and deliver what was needed to affected communities. In\nboth cases, the efforts are critiques of government failure, while\nprovisioning services that were needed.)\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      If Senator Graham and Tom Steinberg are teaching civics, helping\nus learn to influence legislators and government authority figures,\nI think we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re starting to see lessons in cultural and service\ntheories of change coming from the internet. Further, I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d argue\nthat the internet is especially well suited for enabling change\nusing these two theories, and that we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re likely to see civics that\nreflect the rise of citizen power through influencing culture and\nproviding services directly.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      The old civics taught us how to identify authority figures to\ninfluence and understand processes to lobby for change. A new\ndigital civics teaches us how to raise attention for causes, how to\nuse distributed populations to propose solutions to problems, and\nhow to synchronize supporters around a strategy.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s consider\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://kony2012.com" shape="rect">Kony2012</a>\n                      , a\ncampaign intended to mobilize youth in the US that grew so large it\nreceived significant attention on the Australian side of the\nPacific. Invisible Children, the organizers of the movement, are\ndeeply passionate about arresting Joseph Kony, Ugandan warlord and\nhead of a group called the Lord\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Resistance Army. The organization\nfaced a challenging problem, in that the LRA is not near the top of\nanyone\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s threats list globally, or even in eastern Africa, probably\nwith good reason. While Kony had a horrific impact on northern\nUganda about a decade ago, he now has a few hundred fighters at\nmost, and is hiding deep in the jungle, far from centers of\npopulation.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Invisible Children needed to get Kony onto the political agenda,\nwhich they accomplished by putting Kony on the media agenda. The\ngoal of the Kony2012 campaign \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c to make Kony famous \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c is a classic\ncultural theory of change using social media as the primary tactic\nfor spreading attention. With a deeply manipulative viral video and\na very smart campaign that used students already committed to the\nmovement to build social media buzz, lobbying celebrities to throw\ntheir attention to the movement, Invisible Children generated 100\nmillion views of their video in six days and caught the attention\nof political leaders who may have been unaware of the issues\npreviously. Was the campaign a success? If the goal was to get\nmillions of Americans focused on the LRA on an ongoing basis, the\nanswer is no \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Invisible Children\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s call to action, a night where\nstudents would take to the streets and spread information about\nKony, received far less attention than the initial video. But it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s\nlikely that the campaign succeeded as a more traditional\nlegislative campaign, as Congress has reaffirmed support for an\nongoing US troop presence in Uganda to pursue Kony.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      By contrast, the Occupy movement gained a large amount of\nattention, but has had little success channeling it to specific\nlegislative changes. The helpful website WhatTheFuckHasOccupyDone\nlists some of the movement\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s accomplishments \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c while one\n(commentary on a bank regulation bill) engages specifically with\nlegislative processes, and several point to concrete achievements\nin providing services, many of the accomplishments focus on\ncultural change. Occupy, the site asserts, has made inequality\ncentral to policy debates and called attention to ongoing issues of\ncorporate influence over political systems. This may be true,\nthough it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to know how lasting these changes will be. But\ngiven Occupy\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s reasonable skepticism of the legislative process, it\nmay not be reasonable to ask movement leaders to push for change\nthrough a system they have little confidence in. The danger is that\nattention is a fragile commodity and tends to decay quickly, if not\nharnessed to action.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      As with KONY2012, activism around SOPA/PIPA began by calling\nattention to an issue that hand\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t been in the public spotlight, a\nbill backed by the copyright industry with far-reaching\nimplications for internet governance. A broad range of activists\nworked to call attention to the bill, reframe it as a bill about\ncensorship, not anti-piracy, and to propose dozens of different\nstrategies to protest the legislation. One particular tactic \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c\nblacking out a website in protest \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c was promoted by online\ncommunity Reddit, and when Wikipedia declared that the\nEnglish-language version of the site would black out, hundreds of\nother sites decided to join the protest. This process of gaining\nattention, brainstorming multiple tactics and converging on a\nspecific, scaleable tactic looks like one possible outline for\nsuccessful digital activism, though it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not clear it will work for\nother, less internet connected issues. But for the moment,\nSOPA/PIPA appears dead, and the internet has gained a cadre of\nactivists willing to follow a\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/26/business/la-fi-tn-internet-defense-league-bat-signal-20120525" shape="rect"> \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93cat signal\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd</a>\n                      to mobilize in defense of threats to the\ninternet.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Raising attention is useful for attracting money and for passing\nlegislation, but there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a danger that attention can quickly\ndissipate if underlying political systems are too badly broken to\nmake real change possible. In those cases, using attention to\nsupport direction action looks like a good alternative. This\nreturns us to Jase Wilson in Kansas City. If the government won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t\ncreate a trolley line, Wilson wonders whether he might be able to\nbuild one himself by gaining attention and raising money from\npossible supporters.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      If Wilson\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s effort succeeded, there would be some\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2012/08/10/how-do-we-make-civic-crowdfunding-awesome/" shape="rect"> tough questions to answer</a>\n                      . Would the Kansas City government be\nrequired to maintain the trolley he and supporters built? What if\nthey can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t afford to do so or decide they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t want to do so? What\nmessage does it send that donors are able to provide services that\na government can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t provide? Does this attempt to build public goods\nthrough crowdfunding inadvertently support the notion that\ngovernments should do less and people should do more, replacing\ntaxes with voluntary donations?\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s lots of reasons to love civic crowdfunding. It allows\nfor distributed innovation, where individuals can propose\ninterventions, raise attention to the most compelling ideas and\nsynchronize giving to make pilot projects possible. It takes\nadvantage of an internet-age fondness for choice. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re interested\nin sponsoring exactly the projects we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re interested in, and having\na relationship with the people we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re benefitting, whether we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re\nlending money on Kiva, donating it on GlobalGiving or DonorsChoose,\nor investing in an arts project on Kickstarter. But there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a\nreason to fear it, too, especially if crowdfunding turns into an\nalternative to taxation and support for a minimalist state.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Efforts like Jase Wilson\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s campaign quickly lead us into thorny\nphilosophical territory. Do we celebrate or condemn these new forms\nof civic innovation? I think we might start addressing those\nquestions by answering a simpler one \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c what are the strengths and\nweaknesses of these new forms of digital civics?\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s good evidence that the internet helps us:\n- Change the media agenda by channeling attention towards an issue\nor cause\n- Brainstorming a wide range of possible tactics and theories of\nchange\n- Synchronizing people around one or more campaigns, contributing\nattention, money and other forms of engagement\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Thus far, there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s less evidence that the internet helps with\n- Creating spaces for reasoned deliberation, particularly across\nideological lines\n- Channeling attention to move levers of power\n- Sustaining projects beyond their inception\n- Choosing between competing demands for our attention \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c i.e., is\ncapturing Kony more worthy of our attention that fighting for\nfreedom of speech in Ethiopia, or was it simply better\nmarketed.\n- Ensuring that resources are allocated fairly\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m beginning to think that certain types of civic participation\nare simply organic to the internet. Once we have the ability to\ncreate and share our own information, we create and spread media to\npromote the causes we care about and raise money to support the\ncauses we value. If these trends are general ones, they might\nsuggest what we might hope governments could do in response.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      I believe we want governments to help us ensure that digital\ncivics leads to a world that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s more fair. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the nature of civic\nengagement that the articulate and the angry get the most\nattention. This tendency may be amplified in digital civics, given\nthat much of the practice involves manipulating and channeling\nattention. If digitally savvy activists gain support for their\ncauses at the expense of the less wired, and communities with\ndisposable income finance new public goods, while poorer\ncommunities go without, we should expect governments to help level\nthe playing field. This might mean learning from civic innovations\nin more privileged communities and providing funding and support\nfor similar interventions in less-resourced areas.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      If internet civics are good at starting experiments and bad at\nsustaining projects, can we use civic crowdfunding to start\nexperiments and taxes to sustain projects in the long term? If\nwe\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re bad at online deliberation, can some of the tricks of\ncontemporary offline civics, like participatory budgeting, come\ninto play in online spaces? In other words, if we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re moving to a\nworld where online power complements offline power, how do we build\nand teach a new form of civics that takes advantage of what seems\nto work best offline and online?\n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style="clear: both; background: url(http://s.collected.info/img/line_i.gif) top left repeat-x;" id="share">\n                  <a target="_blank" href="http://clct.me/9eTLF" class="colori" shape="rect">Permalink</a>\n                  <img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 3px;" src="http://s.collected.info/img/vr.gif"></img>\n                  <a href="http://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fclct.me%2F9eTLF&amp;t=Understanding%20digital%20civics" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Share on Facebook</a>\n                  <img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 3px;" src="http://s.collected.info/img/vr.gif"></img>\n                  <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Understanding%20digital%20civics%20http%3A%2F%2Fclct.me%2F9eTLF%20(via http://creativecommons.collected.info)" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Share on Twitter</a>\n                  <img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 3px;" src="http://s.collected.info/img/vr.gif"></img>\n                  <a href="mailto:?subject=Understanding%20digital%20civics&amp;body=http%3A%2F%2Fclct.me%2F9eTLF" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Share via Email</a>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div class="colori wline"></div>\n            </div>\n            <div class="feed_35630">\n              <div class="item">\n                <div class="favicon">\n                  <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="90" width="90">\n                    <tr valign="middle">\n                      <td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="center">\n                        <img height="24" width="24" src="http://s.collected.info/favicon/2c/2cbdbf7fede1eea16eeac52f3520a6e1.ico"></img>\n                      </td>\n                    </tr>\n                  </table>\n                </div>\n                <div class="arrow"></div>\n                <div class="feedcontent">\n                  <h2>\n                    <a href="http://clct.me/9et2n" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Long Flights\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c a somewhat serious business idea</a>\n                  </h2>\n                  <br clear="none"></br>\n                  <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">\n                    <b>...My heart\'s in Accra</b>\n                  </a>\n                  30 Aug 2012, 5:06 pm CEST\n                  <div class="feedtext colorlinki">\n                    <br clear="none"></br>\n                    <p>I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m considering starting a new business venture.

So I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m thinking about a business that lets you stay on the\nground, but rent a writing space that mimics the key features of a\nlong plane flight.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      No connectivity \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been productive on long flights where\nI\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve had internet access, but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a very different form of\nproductivity. Craig Newmark and I were invited to the same\nconference in South Korea some years back and sat side by side for\n15 hours, answering email on the way from NYC to Seoul. I reached\ninbox zero, but I didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t write anything I was proud of, as I kept\ngetting distracted by incoming mail. And that was before\nTwitter.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Long Flight\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd facilities will be located inside Faraday cages. Once you enter the facility, your phone will be cut off from GSM and CDMA networks, and Wifi won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t work. You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll be encouraged to download and cache anything you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll need to read ahead of time.</p>\n                    <p>\n                      Fixed duration \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c I work well in libraries, but I tend to leave\nthem after I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve accomplished the main task I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d had on my to do\nlist. One of the reason long flights are so productive is that\nyou\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re committed to staying in a space well beyond the time you\nneed to accomplish a task. For me, that means I get a blogpost or\nchapter written, but I also catch up on papers I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve needed to\nread.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Long Flight\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd facilities will be bookable for durations of 6, 8,\n10, 12 and 14 hours.

(You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll sign a waiver\nthat prevents us from being charged with holding you against your\nwill.

But if you abuse it to end your\nsession early, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll ban you from the facility.)\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Each pod will feature a screen that shows the progress of your\nflight to your \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93destination\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd.

While the snacks and meals provided on board planes\naren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t always the tastiest, the ability to eat where you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re working\nis helpful, and being able to walk to the galley for another\nbeverage can be a useful break in routine.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Your admission to \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Long Flight\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd will include unlimited food and\nbeverage from the galleys.

Closure of public parks\nmatters less to people who can afford country club memberships or\nthe dues at a gym or YMCA.

It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not hard to imagine a\ncash-strapped municipality taking a list of parks they can\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t build\nor maintain posting projects to Kickstarter or Neighbor.ly, seeking\ncrowdfunding for their support.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      I think that would probably be a bad thing. Unless done very\ncarefully, crowdfunding a city\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s projects is likely to favor\nwealthy neighborhoods over poor ones. People in poorer\nneighborhoods have less to spend on crowdfunding projects, and are\nless likely to have internet access. If Lange\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s observation that\npeople tend to Kickstart projects they benefit from holds true,\nwe\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d expect to see a wealth of parks funded in Brooklyn and few in\nthe Bronx.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      But unfairness isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t the only problem. If crowdfunding parks\nsucceeds, it supports the case that governments don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t need to build\nparks because they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll get built anyway through the magic of civic\ncrowdfunding. That, in turn, supports the Norquistian argument for\na government small enough to drown in a bathtub, with services\nprovided by the free market and by crowdfunding a thousand points\nof light.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Is Jase Wilson, the guy who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s trying to fund the Kansas City\nstreetcar line on Neighbor.ly a secret agent of the radical right?\nOf course not \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a well-intentioned guy who\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s turning to a\nsuccessful online model to support a project he cares about. The\nnature of unintended consequences is that they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re the downside of\nan otherwise worthwhile activity. Bringing neighbors together to\nmake their neighborhood better is a good thing.

Wikipedia demonstrates that volunteers\ncan produce a high quality reference work. The campaigns against\nSOPA/PIPA and the Susan G. Komen Foundation show that activists,\nloosely linked through the internet, can achieve social change.\nCivic crowdfunding leverages many of the same mechanisms: rapid and\nlightweight group formation, coordination of efforts, enlightened\nself interest.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>Here are some thoughts on how we could embrace civic crowdfunding and avoid the downsides:</p>\n                    <p>\n                      <b>Avoid rhetoric that posits crowdfunding as a remedy for government inaction and failure.</b>\n                      There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a proud tradition on\nthe left of building social services for communities ignored or\nshortchanged by the government.

These\nqualities are ideal for disruption, for the spread of\nnetworked-organized crime, and for fostering the lack of shared\nvalues.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/h32DF1Wg_sC_r6fnFIVPkWHGjtA/0/da" shape="rect">\n                        <img border="0" src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/h32DF1Wg_sC_r6fnFIVPkWHGjtA/0/di" ismap="true"></img>\n                      </a>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/h32DF1Wg_sC_r6fnFIVPkWHGjtA/1/da" shape="rect">\n                        <img border="0" src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/h32DF1Wg_sC_r6fnFIVPkWHGjtA/1/di" ismap="true"></img>\n                      </a>\n                    </p>\n                    <div>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/kklifestream?a%3DSXuw7_iOUB4:FhcadGKCgvM:yIl2AUoC8zA" shape="rect">\n                        <img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/kklifestream?d%3DyIl2AUoC8zA"></img>\n                      </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <img width="1" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/kklifestream/~4/SXuw7_iOUB4"></img>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style="clear: both; background: url(http://s.collected.info/img/line_i.gif) top left repeat-x;" id="share">\n                  <a target="_blank" href="http://clct.me/8I4Af" class="colori" shape="rect">Permalink</a>\n                  <img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 3px;" src="http://s.collected.info/img/vr.gif"></img>\n                  <a href="http://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fclct.me%2F8I4Af&amp;t=In%20the%20network%20economy%2C%20ownership%20is%20fragmented..." target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Share on Facebook</a>\n                  <img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 3px;" src="http://s.collected.info/img/vr.gif"></img>\n                  <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=In%20the%20network%20economy%2C%20ownership%20is%20fragmented...%20http%3A%2F%2Fclct.me%2F8I4Af%20(via http://creativecommons.collected.info)" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Share on Twitter</a>\n                  <img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 3px;" src="http://s.collected.info/img/vr.gif"></img>\n                  <a href="mailto:?subject=In%20the%20network%20economy%2C%20ownership%20is%20fragmented...&amp;body=http%3A%2F%2Fclct.me%2F8I4Af" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Share via Email</a>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div class="colori wline"></div>\n            </div>\n            <div class="feed_35630">\n              <div class="item">\n                <div class="favicon">\n                  <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="90" width="90">\n                    <tr valign="middle">\n                      <td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="center">\n                        <img height="24" width="24" src="http://s.collected.info/favicon/2c/2cbdbf7fede1eea16eeac52f3520a6e1.ico"></img>\n                      </td>\n                    </tr>\n                  </table>\n                </div>\n                <div class="arrow"></div>\n                <div class="feedcontent">\n                  <h2>\n                    <a href="http://clct.me/8yOiz" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Happy distractions: sumo, South African music, and Islamic hackerfic</a>\n                  </h2>\n                  <br clear="none"></br>\n                  <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">\n                    <b>...My heart\'s in Accra</b>\n                  </a>\n                  18 Jul 2012, 3:44 pm CEST\n                  <div class="feedtext colorlinki">\n                    <br clear="none"></br>\n                    <p>\n                      This year is the first in decades where I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been beneficiary\nand victim of the academic schedule. While I spent almost a decade\nat the Berkman Center, research at that institution continues\nyear-round, and there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s not much of a summer lull. The Media Lab is\ncloser to the traditional academic cycle, as many students head out\nof the lab for internships and many of the professors hole up to\ncomplete research and writing.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m trying to follow their lead and am revising the book I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve been working on for the past two years, towards a spring publication date.

But when you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re writing a book on the Internet, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s very hard\nto eliminate online distractions without cutting yourself off from\nyour research subject. (And, if you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re sufficiently skilled at\ndistractibility, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll find ways to convince yourself that the\nwebsite you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re frenetically clicking through is somehow related to\nyour core research topics.)\n                    </p>\n                    <p>So, here\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s what\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s most distracting me today:</p>\n                    <p>We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re nearing the end of the Nagoya basho, sumo\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s summer tournament.

Our idea is a simple one \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c we want to help\npeople in nations where electric power is scarce sell power to\ntheir neighbors. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re designing a piece of prototype hardware that\nplugs into a diesel generator or other power source, distributes\nthe power to multiple outlets, monitors how much power is used and\ncharges the customer for the power they consume.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Kenya is a great place to try this idea out, because it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s got\none of the most mature electronic payment infrastructures in the\nworld. Built on top of\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://safaricom.co.ke/" shape="rect">Safaricom\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s</a>\n                      mobile phone network,\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa" shape="rect">M-PESA</a>\n                      is a money\ntransfer system that allows phone users to send payments to one\nanother as an encrypted SMS. If I want to pay my taxi driver\n2000Ksh for the ride from downtown to the airport, I can access\nM-PESA on my phone, enter the size of payment and his mobile\nnumber, and he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll receive an SMS within a few seconds telling him\nthe transaction has been completed. Money comes in and out of the\nsystem via thousands of M-PESA dealers, who work in towns of any\nsubstantial size, turning money into credit and vice versa.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Because this payment system is used by 70% of Kenyan adults,\naccording to our friends at Safaricom, it makes sense to try to\nbuild our power system on top of it. What we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re designing currently\nlooks like a\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.p3international.com/products/special/p4400/p4400-ce.html" shape="rect"> Kill-A-Watt</a>\n                      \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c a unit that monitors energy usage via an ammeter\n\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c and a M-PESA-enabled mobile phone. When we build it, it will\nprobably resemble a power strip with a SIM-card slot. Someone who\nowns a generator can plug our strip in, then invite neighboring\nshops or homes to run 20-amp power cords to the strip. Each outlet\non the strip has a user ID, and the strip itself has an M-PESA ID.\nTo turn on the power, a user sends funds to the power strip\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s\nM-PESA account. The strip monitors usage, sends an SMS to warn a\ncustomer when she\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s low on power credit and shuts the power off\nwhen she\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s out of credit.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      This might sound clever (or stupid) on paper, but it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to\nknow what works until you actually talk to the people you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d like to\nuse your product. If we were on a research trip designed to focus\non this product, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d have planned trips to a variety of\ndestinations: rural villages, secondary cities, refugee camps. But\nwe were mostly coming to attend the Global Voices conference, so\nour research was confined to Nairobi. We sought help from our\nfriends at\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pawa254.org/" shape="rect">Pawa254</a>\n                      , an arts\ncenter that works extensively in low-income communities like\nMathare, to find guides who could show us their neighborhoods and\nask questions about electricity.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      And so on our first full day in Kenya, my students Nathan\nMatias, Matt Stempeck and I found ourselves in a profoundly cramped\ncar, with our new friends Addu and Mike, on Baba Dogo Road. Baba\nDogo was intended to be an industrial area on the outskirts of the\ncity, and there are several large manufacturing plants lining the\nroad. But there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s also thousands of people living here, in\nneighborhoods that have sprung up where land was empty and\ninexpensive. Baba Dogo isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t the sort of \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93famous\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd slum like Kibera\nor Mathare \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c telling some of our Kenyan friends where we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d done our\nresearch, they told us we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d been to an \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93upscale slum\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd, the sort of\ndistinction that makes sense in a town like Nairobi, where slum\ntourism is a growth business. Sammi, a musician who lives in the\narea, led us in on his motorbike, and proceeded to show us around\ntown, talking to the dozens of merchants who ran shops in the\narea.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Assumption one: I had assumed power would be scarce in Baba\nDogo. Nope.\n                      <b>Legal</b>\n                      power is scarce, but power is extremely\ncommon. Kenya Light and Power is quite good about extending the\ngrid into this neighborhood, though few houses are directly\nconnected. Historically, that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s because it was both expensive and\ntime consuming to get a grid connection \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c friends tell horror\nstories of connections that cost more than $10,000 and took half a\nyear to get in place. Now connections cost closer to $350 and take\nonly a week\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0 but they\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re still way out of reach of ordinary Baba\nDogo residents. What usually happens is that a single dwelling\nwithin an apartment building has a meter, and they distribute power\nto their neighbors.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <a target="_blank" title="IMG_0157 by ethanz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethanz/7535147422/" shape="rect">\n                        <img alt="IMG_0157" height="500" width="375" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8005/7535147422_275ac51ec0.jpg"></img>\n                      </a>\n                      <i>The Hardcore Gym, in Baba Dogo</i>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <a target="_blank" title="IMG_0159 by ethanz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethanz/7535148256/" shape="rect">\n                        <img alt="IMG_0159" height="375" width="500" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7116/7535148256_d3ec14e6ee.jpg"></img>\n                      </a>\n                      <i>Pumping iron, in this case, brake drums and gears.</i>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      While this system works, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hard to say that it works well.\nLet\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s take the example of The Hardcore Gym, a weightlifting gym in\na small building made of corrugated iron sheets (where I\nembarrassed myself by failing to bench press the pile of brake\ndrums and gears this dude is easily lifting\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0) The gym needs\nelectricity to power a TV and a satellite dish, used to watch major\nfootball matches: that night\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Euro Cup semifinal between Italy and\nGermany was 30Ksh a head, or about $0.40. The gym doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t have a\nformal grid connection, so the proprietor buys power from the house\nnext door, for 200Ksh ($2.50) a month. He doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t know whether this\nis a fair price or not, as neither he or the homeowner can monitor\nthe power he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s using. He lives in some fear that the homeowner\nwon\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t pay the bills, and he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll be left without power \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c this is\npretty common, as a homeowner may be selling power to dozens of\npeople, pushing her bills very high. Sometimes, another businessman\ntold us, the person selling you power disappears, leaving tens of\nthousands of shilling in debt to Kenya Light and Power and leaving\neveryone dependent on that power source out of luck.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      It isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t any more fun for the person selling power. You\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re\nforced to collect small sums from dozens of very poor people every\nmonth, and if they don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t pay, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re short of money to pay your own\nbills.

Instead, they continue to use contaminated\nwater from local streams, a phenomenon that poses an ethical\ndilemma \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c should Grundfos simply open the tap and let everyone\ndrink for free, or continue with an experiment that promises a\nsustainable, clean water source over time?\n                    </p>\n                    <p>How does charging a mobile phone become worth as much as 200 liters of clean water?</p>\n                    <p>\n                      One brutally simple answer is that customers have an alternative\nwhen it comes to purchasing water: they can get dirty water for\nfree. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s no alternative when it comes to power. Conventional\neconomics suggests that, as power is a commodity, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d expect to\nsee sharp price competition until vendors were operating on very\nthin profit margins. Instead, we see power providers settling on a\nprice that seems high to me, but is evidently sufficiently\naffordable that customers will pay. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s unclear whether anyone is\ntrying to maintain cartel pricing and punishing defectors, or\nwhether power vendors simply have agreed that 20 shillings is a\ngood price for customers to pay for the service.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Why would customers be willing to pay this much? Phones have\nbecome an indispensable infrastructure in the developing world. If\nyou are a carpenter, you probably don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t have an office or a shop \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c\nyou have a mobile phone number that people call if they want to\nhire you. If you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re a market trader, you use your phone constantly\nto figure out what prices are in other parts of a city or the\ncountry. If you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re seeking a business permit, you call before you\nvisit an office, so you don\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t waste time on transport if the person\nyou need to see is out. Even independent of payment systems like\nM-PESA, a phone is a difference between being an economic actor in\nKenya and being outside the economy.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Which bring us to questionable assumption three: I thought it\nwould be difficult to convince people to think of themselves as\nbecoming micro-scale power companies. Actually, people grasped this\nidea right away, and wanted to know how much flexibility they would\nhave over pricing. (Answer: we hadn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t really thought about it, but\nit seems like that\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s going to be critical to product success.)\nPeople also explained to us that everyone in Baba Dogo is already\nan entrepreneur of one fashion or another \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c selling power was a\nnatural extension of existing businesses. But we had to understand\nthat not all commerce in the neighborhood was about the exchange of\nmoney for goods or services \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c often businesses provide favors to\none another in complex webs of obligation.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <a target="_blank" title="IMG_0196 by ethanz, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethanz/7535161364/" shape="rect">\n                        <img alt="IMG_0196" height="375" width="500" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8026/7535161364_f6a35f2ab4.jpg"></img>\n                      </a>\n                      <i>The local liquor store, seen from Sammi\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s apartment</i>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      We discovered the complexity of these webs when we tried to get\na taxi out of the neighborhood. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d passed a few well-washed,\nshiny taxis with wooden signs on top that advertised their\navailability. But when we asked Sammi to help us negotiate with a\ncab driver, he quickly found someone who lived in his apartment\nbuilding. His car wasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t shiny \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c indeed, the windows didn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t open\nbecause the owner was trying to repair the controls, which meant\nthat our ride was unpleasantly sweaty. And we noticed that he\nwasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t a very good driver\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0 which he explained by pulling over and\npicking up his driver, \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93because I have only been driving for a few\nweeks, and I am not very good.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd So our attempt to hire a taxi\nturned into hiring a car from a mechanic who was repairing it, and\na driver capable of driving it. Why this was an optimal solution,\nonly Sammi knows \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s possible he shared some of the (extremely\nhigh) fare we paid, or that he had other obligations to his\nneighbors that required us to hire this adhoc taxi, instead of an\nofficial one.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      The ability to pay with favors as well as with money is\nsomething we need to take seriously if we want people to use our\nproduct. It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s important, therefore, that we find a way to make our\ndevice usable in ways other than pre-paid, so that someone with\naccess to power could loan power to someone who wasn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t able to pay,\nin exchange for another good, service or favor.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Assumption four: I figured neighborhoods like Baba Dogo would be\nthe right place to try this product out. They\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re probably not, as\nthey\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re already too well wired. This isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t to say that there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s no\ndemand for our device in Baba Dogo \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c I had the sense we could\nprobably sell a few dozen, with Sammi as our local pitchman. (After\nall, if he can sell me on a taxi ride without windows or a driver,\nhe can surely sell out device.) But it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s likely that the use case\nin Baba Dogo is to use our meter to share a connection from Kenya\nPower and Lighting with other users\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0 and it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s quite possible Kenya\nPower would be unenthusiastic about this use case. (On the other\nhand, they might welcome this as an alternative to dangerous and\nadhoc wiring solutions that are already pervasive in high-density\nneighborhoods.)\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Our better use cases are likely in areas where there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s no power\nother than generator, solar or water power. In some cases, these\nmay be communities where the power grid doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t yet extend, but\nhave GSM coverage. In other cases, they may be refugee camps,\nunlikely to be wired for fear the camps will turn into permanent\nsettlements. There\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s something oddly encouraging about discovering\nthat Nairobi\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s slums are too advanced for our proposed product \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c\nthere\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s no shortage of other markets where access to power is a\nmajor problem and where our solution may prove helpful.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      For me, the visit to Baba Dogo \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c and other visits my students\ntook while we were in Kenya \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c is a helpful counterbalance to the\nunlimited possibilities of the Media Lab.

A range\nof design choices that, like life choices, bend one\'s trajectory\ntowards the heights \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d or into the depths.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Like lives, economies and societies must be\n                      <em>chosen</em>\n                      . Not\nmerely decided upon, by tired, fearful old men in ornate rooms \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut actively chosen, and rechosen, constructed and reconstructed,\nby the norms we choose to enact, and the values you and I choose to\nlive, every second of every day.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      You and I \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d we are more than pawns, marks, algorithms,\n&quot;consumers,&quot; margins. At our highest and fullest, you and I are\nhere in the human world. And the systems we consent in every moment\nto be governed by, through the ideals and values we share, can damn\nus not just to deal with the devil, but to\n                      <em>become</em>\n                      the\ndevils \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d to evoke from one another the smallest and worst in our\nnatures.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>And yet you and I must fight fatalism. There are billions of stars in this galaxy. We\'re moored to a rock perched on the edge of a single one. There is no system. There is only the journey past the edge of impossibility.

A trip to the University of Ghana at Legon felt like a trip\nto the outermost suburbs, if not altogether to the bush. The\nneighborhoods around the airport and university are now fully part\nof the city, blessed with hi-rise buildings, expensive houses and\nwell-maintained roads packed with traffic. Finding the edge of the\ncity now requires driving to the edges of the Accra state, to towns\nI\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d only heard yelled by tro-tro drivers, advertising the terminus\nof their routes.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      With the help of Edmund, who works with my friends at\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.penplusbytes.org/" shape="rect">PenPlusBytes</a>\n                      , I traveled to\nMedie, Accra, a suburb I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d visited roughly ten years past. My\nmemories of the last trip were of a two hour long ordeal over\nrutted roads, packed with traffic, to a place that had more in\ncommon with Ghana\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s rural villages than with its bustling capital.\nNow there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a well-paved four lane divided highway, complete with\nflyovers and exit ramps\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0 most of the way. The interruptions in\ninfrastructure were a great reminder of what had come before \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c as\nwe decelerated from 120kph to 50, it was like moving back into my\nmemories of the chaotic, crowded and slow city.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      The building of the Nsawam Road, as well as the M1 and other\nmajor Accra highways has transformed the geography and real estate\nof the city.

I saw\nhim in Accra on Monday and he insisted I had to come to his house\nto see how things had changed. He wanted me to see that he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d made a\nsane investment, and it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s clear he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s right. I hadn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t expected some\nof what accompanied the transition: gated and planned communities\nlining some stretches of the road, John Deere dealerships on\nothers.

His project for the last ten years\nhas been the building of the Dagara Music Center, his school to\nteach the dance, drumming and xylophone traditions of the Dagara\npeople. For years, Bernard has been spending the academic year in\nthe US, pursuing a bachelor\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s degree at SUNY Fredonia and a masters\nin African Studies at Indiana University, then returning to his\nhome to teach his music to American students hardy enough to brave\nthe road to his home, sleep in his spare bedrooms and endure his\nmix of teaching, teasing and good-natured hectoring.\n                    </p>\n                    <div>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/wp-content/2012/06/bernarddrums.jpg" shape="rect">\n                        <img height="337" width="450" title="bernarddrums" alt="" src="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/wp-content/2012/06/bernarddrums-450x337.jpg" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-4399"></img>\n                      </a>\n                      <p>Bernard in his drum room</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <p>\n                      He built it and they came.

We stayed for lunch and I met half a dozen\nstudents, staying in Bernard\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s house or a nearby hotel, taking\nlessons from Bernard\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s extended family and circle of friends. As\nstudent drummers do, they began beating patterns on the picnic\ntable whenever a lull crept into the conversation and I found\nmyself drumming along, playing patterns I learned from Bernard\nalmost twenty years ago.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      As I headed out, Bernard was preparing his neatly painted\nMercedes bus for a run to the airport to pick up the next dozen\nstudents. Roughly a hundred students will pass through this summer,\nsome for a few days, some for weeks or months. A few years ago,\nBernard would tour the US with his dance company to support the\nnascent academy \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c now the revenue from the summer students allows\nhim to focus on his studies while he\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s in the states.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      When I studied with Bernard, it was a happy accident that\nfollowed from a run of rough luck. I came to Ghana to study at the\nuniversity at Legon\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\xa0 which was on strike the year I was there.

Lang is a origami genius.\nHe helped NASA design satellite folding/unfolding solar panels. He\nuses computers to devise folding patterns to create impossibly\ndetailed 3D organisms from a single piece of paper. The pattern on\nthe left below will, when folded by him, turn into a convincing\nRhinocerous Beetle. The pattern is an intermediate artifact of the\norigami process, often published for other origami fans.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <img height="375" width="500" border="0" alt="Image" src="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//image.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></img>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>Sarah Morris is a respected abstract painter, who has painted grids and geometric shapes, and &quot;found&quot; patterns for decades, and has had major shows in major museums. Many of her early paintings look origami folds.</p>\n                    <p>\n                      <img height="500" width="500" border="0" alt="Endeavor" src="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//Endeavor.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></img>\n                    </p>\n                    <p> So it was no big stretch when she started painting &quot;found&quot; origami fold patterns, adding colors, removing lines here and there. One of the patterns she found was Lang\'s Beetle pattern. Her painting of it is on the right.</p>\n                    <p>\n                      <img height="258" width="500" border="0" alt="Sarah morris fig b" src="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//sarah_morris_fig_b.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></img>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>Not just one pattern, but several.</p>\n                    <p>\n                      <img height="253" width="500" border="0" alt="Sarah morris copyright infringement" src="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//sarah_morris_copyright_infringement.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></img>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Lang claims that he has been displaying and even selling his\nfold patterns as art for years. Morris claims she has been painting\nfound patterns like this for years, and that she &quot;transforms&quot; the\nfound piece into something new. Just as Warhol transformed the soup\ncan, and Lichtenstein transformed the comic panel, from artifact\ninto art.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>I can see Lang\'s point and share his anguish, but in the end, I\'d rule in Morris\'s favor, because I think she has transformed the found artifact. I follow the question, &quot;Is it bettered by the borrower?&quot; In this case, yes.</p>\n                    <p>Did Warhol better the soup can? That is hard to say, but he did transform it. &quot;Transformation&quot; works even better as a guide to these hard questions. Did Fairey transform the photo into a poster? Yes. Did Morris transform Lang\'s crease pattern? Yes.</p>\n                    <p>\n                      I find the notion of transformation is a pretty good question to\nask about copyright conundrums. Did the copier transform the work?\nIf yes, then the derivative is not really a &quot;copy&quot;; it\'s been\ntransformed, mutated, improved, evolved. That is still a judgement\ncall, but it is the right question.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/jRnKSbuoztPEaHP-GebxHy9niB8/0/da" shape="rect">\n                        <img border="0" src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/jRnKSbuoztPEaHP-GebxHy9niB8/0/di" ismap="true"></img>\n                      </a>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/jRnKSbuoztPEaHP-GebxHy9niB8/1/da" shape="rect">\n                        <img border="0" src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/jRnKSbuoztPEaHP-GebxHy9niB8/1/di" ismap="true"></img>\n                      </a>\n                    </p>\n                    <div>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/kklifestream?a%3DP0MoZWdw-ig:GcshnSEaBBI:yIl2AUoC8zA" shape="rect">\n                        <img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/kklifestream?d%3DyIl2AUoC8zA"></img>\n                      </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <img width="1" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/kklifestream/~4/P0MoZWdw-ig"></img>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style="clear: both; background: url(http://s.collected.info/img/line_i.gif) top left repeat-x;" id="share">\n                  <a target="_blank" href="http://clct.me/8e2PM" class="colori" shape="rect">Permalink</a>\n                  <img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 3px;" src="http://s.collected.info/img/vr.gif"></img>\n                  <a href="http://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fclct.me%2F8e2PM&amp;t=The%20Rule%20of%20Transformation" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Share on Facebook</a>\n                  <img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 3px;" src="http://s.collected.info/img/vr.gif"></img>\n                  <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=The%20Rule%20of%20Transformation%20http%3A%2F%2Fclct.me%2F8e2PM%20(via http://creativecommons.collected.info)" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Share on Twitter</a>\n                  <img style="vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 3px;" src="http://s.collected.info/img/vr.gif"></img>\n                  <a href="mailto:?subject=The%20Rule%20of%20Transformation&amp;body=http%3A%2F%2Fclct.me%2F8e2PM" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">Share via Email</a>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div class="colori wline"></div>\n            </div>\n            <div class="feed_17245">\n              <div class="item">\n                <div class="favicon">\n                  <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="90" width="90">\n                    <tr valign="middle">\n                      <td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="center">\n                        <img height="24" width="24" src="http://s.collected.info/favicon/60/6069a620d17fe74d42207dd5235e7a35.ico"></img>\n                      </td>\n                    </tr>\n                  </table>\n                </div>\n                <div class="arrow"></div>\n                <div class="feedcontent">\n                  <h2>\n                    <a href="http://clct.me/8cuBm" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">I See Cats</a>\n                  </h2>\n                  <br clear="none"></br>\n                  <a href="http://kk.org/kk/" target="_blank" class="colori" shape="rect">\n                    <b>KK Lifestream</b>\n                  </a>\n                  27 Jun 2012, 11:11 am CEST\n                  <div class="feedtext colorlinki">\n                    <br clear="none"></br>\n                    <i>\n                      Originally posted in\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/" shape="rect">The Technium</a>\n                    </i>\n                    <p>An artificial intelligence discovered cats on the internet.</p>\n                    <p>\n                      Google researchers connected 16,000 computer cores together into\na huge neural net (like the network of neurons in your brain) and\nthen used a software program to ask what it (the neural net) &quot;saw&quot;\nin a pool of 1 million pictures downloaded randomly from the\ninternet.

Today e-bikes have a limited\nrange of 20-30 miles (50km) because of battery constraints. So most\ne-bikes are sold for daily commuters, especially in a hilly city\nlike San Francisco. Zip to work and back with no car, faster than\npublic transport. You can get some very good e-bikes these days.\nMillions of them are sold and used in China, and there are also\nvery good models from Europe.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      But I am looking for a touring e-bike, one that could give me\nmild assistance over 80 miles. I am doing a 1,000-mile tour with my\nteenage son and his cousin, and I can\'t keep up with them,\nparticularly on the hills. So I need a very mild assist to &quot;flatten\nthe hills&quot; yet lightweight enough that for the rest of the time\nwhile I am pedaling, the bike with motor is not a burden.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Eric Hicks, the expert at\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.electricbike.com/" shape="rect">ElectricBike.com</a>\n                      recommended I\ntry out a German Stromer e-bike. The legendary bike rental store\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blazingsaddles.com/" shape="rect">Blazing Saddles</a>\n                      rents\ne-bikes to tourists near the Golden Gate Bridge, so I headed there\nlast weekend.\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blazingsaddles.com/store/product.aspx?catid%3D56,102%26pid%3D100" shape="rect"> The Stromer</a>\n                      uses a motor on the back wheel, called a hub motor,\nand retains some of the chain derailer shifting. When the motor is\noff you can pedal as normal (the motor doesn\'t impede your\npedaling), and you pedal even while the motor is running -- thus it\nis called Pedal Assist. You can set the amount of assist you want,\nfrom very low to very strong. The motor will only assist when you\npedal. So it is not a lightweight motorcycle, but a pedal assist\nbicycle. A downside of the a hub motor is that changing a flat is a\nhuge project.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      So on Saturday I rode the Stromer with my son on 30-mile\nroundtrip across the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin. I was able to\nkeep up with him (he\'s on a fast road bike), but only by using the\nassist on most hills, more than I thought I would. I can handle\nmost hills on a road bike myself, so I was only looking for assist\non the steepest hills. But the e-bike is so heavy with motor and\nbattery and the gears do not go low enough so that I had to use the\nlowest help for any hill. Catch-22. I could only go non-assist on\nthe flats and downhills. But we did 30 miles and I had 3/4 of the\ncharge left, so it is possible I could get twice that mileage out\nof it using it as I did, only in the lowest setting.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      <img height="385" width="600" border="0" alt="FO11 E Bike Jarifa Speed 01 307db8f0d0" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/FO11_E-Bike_Jarifa_Speed_01_307db8f0d0.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></img>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      Also on Friday I test rode the Focus e-bike from\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwheel.net/" shape="rect">New Wheels</a>\n                      in Bernal Heights, San\nFrancisco. The\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwheel.net/Store/Focus%20Jarifa%20Speed/index.html" shape="rect">Focus Speed</a>\n                      is from Europe and uses a Panasonic mid-drive. Rather\nthan turn the back (or front wheel), it turns the chain from a\nplace near the crankshaft (mid-point). The Focus has a mighty\n18-amp battery, and in low &quot;eco&quot; mode, and with a smaller drive\nsprocket, New Wheels believe I can get 80 miles from it. I did not\nfind it noisy, a complaint of some other mid-drives. Like the\nStromer, it is too heavy and high geared to pedal up any kind of\nhills without assist, especially if loaded with touring gear. I\npreferred it to the Stromer because the controls were nicer,\nbattery bigger, and the mid-drive would be less complicated to fix\na flat tire.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>I tried out one other e-bike, a recumbent, and today I hope to try another. I\'ll report here on which, if any, I buy. But whatever one I go for, it\'s a bike for touring, with only mild assist. If I were buying one just for commuting, I might choose another.</p>\n                    <p>If you know a lot about bikes, or have one to recommend as fantastic, please rave about it in the comments, or send us a review.</p>\n                    <p>-- KK</p>\n                    <p>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/MFDo56jJZO68y4skXJqyCjvQPdE/0/da" shape="rect">\n                        <img border="0" src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/MFDo56jJZO68y4skXJqyCjvQPdE/0/di" ismap="true"></img>\n                      </a>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/MFDo56jJZO68y4skXJqyCjvQPdE/1/da" shape="rect">\n                        <img border="0" src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/MFDo56jJZO68y4skXJqyCjvQPdE/1/di" ismap="true"></img>\n                      </a>\n                    </p>\n                    <div>\n                      <a target="_blank" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/kklifestream?a%3Dfoh9tt_baAM:P9iF1KV-WKI:yIl2AUoC8zA" shape="rect">\n                        <img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/kklifestream?d%3DyIl2AUoC8zA"></img>\n                      </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <img width="1" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/kklifestream/~4/foh9tt_baAM"></img>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style="clear: both;
