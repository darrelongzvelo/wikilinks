Moldings, Castings, and Crumblings



Lately all of my energy outside of design is going to rethinking the geodes. I have coveted the
use of paper and loved the process of deterioration , but there are other factors at play now:
art buying, size, and ease of replication.

1. Interior installations /art pieces are something I’ve obviously started and as I create
them I’m always thinking of how they can be purchased. I’m happy that people are willing to
buy these hand-crafted pieces coated inÂ polyurethaneÂ paint (which should help them
last longer), but I know that potential buyers will want something guaranteed forever.

2. Size! The Box Geode was huge and I did it and I feel like a maniac and I’m proud! What an
accomplishment to fold around 5,000 pieces of paper (with help of my two awesome assistants of
course). I would do it again and probably will, but I’d like to go bigger and faster.

3. Now I need easy replication. As my work load grows larger and the demand is more, I cannot keep
doing street art pieces every week. In fact, I’ve done none all summer. I’m sad I’ll lose
the green nature and the quick deterioration, but I think spreading the work may win out for me.

The solution:

Resin casting. I’ve been experimenting with making molds of my paper pieces and casting
them in various types of resin. Some of you may be following me on Facebook or Instagram and seen
some of my successes. I’ve provided a few images below of what I’ve been working on.

The plan is to cast pieces faster and make them myself for around Los Angeles. The other plan is
to send out packages to people around the world so they can create the art themselves in their
cities. I have a few hole hunters out there already and am excited to see how this project will
pan out. If anyone is interested, let’s start the conversation too!

Failed plastic roto-casting of square trapezohedron

The large square trapezohedron above is a failure because of the obvious gaping hole on one
side. Fortunately, this can be corrected by how well I rotate my mold when I pour the resin in. I
just wanted to share this large piece because I’m super excited by how much it actually looks
like the paper piece I made. Also, how cool does it look when it looks like it’s melting?!

What do you think of using plastic in the street?

 

In other news, I have some more deterioration images for you. The geode on 7th Street located at
Tony’s Saloon is slowly being torn apart by people. I think it’s crazy interesting! I’m
wondering, is it because it’s in front of a bar, in DTLA, or because it’s so big? Maybe one
day I’ll find a grant to help me study this social interest.

The Making of an Urban Geode



Over the past month, Gregory Tuzin has been shooting bits and pieces of me working on the giant
geode installation at The Standard, Hollywood . I’m excited to show the finished results
here!

It’s actually quite impressive what he’s done in between his own work and
relaxingâ€”shooting with his iphone while I folded pieces at a bar for example. So
stealth! Hope you enjoy the video and are able to make it this Thursday for the reception.

The Standard, Hollywood Reception



My installation is going up tomorrow! I’m equals times shocked the month went by so fast and
relieved the madness is almost over. Although the next day, more work begins as I attempt to
create smaller pieces to be sold during the installation. **This is not a guarantee or
promise, just a teaser!

Next week on Thursday the 14th, we are having an artist reception. I’ll be there drinking
drinks, listening to awesome music played by my friend Jeffrey Paradise, and hanging out with
cool people. I hope anyone in LA can be there!!

My friends at Raconteur are helping me organize the eventâ€”please RSVP to
hello@raconteur.la Â if you can make it.

More Geode Deterioration



The past couple weeks I’ve walked past a couple geodes that are still in commission and saw
that they’ve been deteriorating. This is one of the things I’ve been excited to see! The
first image is from Venice on Abbott Kinney, the paint has dulled and a few pieces have come
ungluedÂ from the constant moisture in the air. The next three images are the larger phone
booth geode I did fairly recently. The plastic covering is missing from the whole booth, where
you see white, the pieces have been torn away by people, and there’s a lovely sheen of dirt
covering the whole piece.

I think thisÂ deteriorationÂ is incredibly cool. Regular minerals do not generally
fall apart so quickly but they are affected by outside forces; breaking apart, getting
covered with dirt, or eventually disappearing altogether. This is another level to the
geodes in which their materials allow them to erode with the building around them and change
with the forces of nature. It’s a very interesting symbiosis of both man-made
architectures.

Announcement! Installation at The Standard, Hollywood



I’ve been blogging and making street art a little less since the Baja geode. All because this
month I have one missionâ€”to create a huge geode for The Standard Hotel in Hollywood !

I personally did not know what it’s called, but like most people I’ve heard of the space,
The Box . You know, the Box behind the front desk, where a model lays every evening (oh
Hollywoodâ€Š)? Every monthÂ  The Standard Â asks a new artist to fill their
approximately 10′ x 5′ glass box with art of their choosing. I’ve been lucky enough to
have been asked to participate this summer for the month of June.

This is a huge task for me, I’ve obviously only been filling small crevices in buildings so
far and an abandoned phone booth here and there. But I do think this is a
greatÂ segueÂ into large site specific installation pieces.Â  The Box Â is a
unique interior space in a building, it looks like a chipped away area or a viewing case in
which, of course you may see the actual inside ofÂ  The Standard Â there.

I’ve hired a few assistants to help me with the folding for a couple days and I’ve employed
Greg once again to help with the installation portion. I’ll be blogging more from here on and
feel free to follow the process on twitter , facebook , tumblr , or instagram . Oh yes, I’ve
majorly crumbled, so pick your poison!

Check out a few photos of past artists inÂ  The Box , and my first steps creating my
installation:

Geode #13â€”In Mexico!



Lucky number 13 for my 30th birthday! This weekend I made a trip to Baja, Mexico with a lot of
amazing friends. We were there to celebrate my birthday, and it was brilliant. I was having
such a good time, I didn’t get to make as many geodes as I planned (I was literally folding in
the car though).

I planned on doing a geode in La Fonda where we stayed and in Puerto Nuevo, but was only able to do
one since we only visited Puerto Nuevo for a short time. I found quite a few holes, as I suspected
I would, but settled on a smaller crack in a wall of the main building of La Fonda. I needed
something smaller since I ended up using a head lamp and sitting amongst my friends at around
10pm the very last night.

This is the result! It’s not painted the best or fit the best, but you do what you can while
celebrating and on the move. I’m super excited I got to do my first international geode,
hopefully I’ll get to travel soon to work solely on getting these out in other cities.

Preparation for Baja



Get ready for some international geodes. I’m off to Baja this weekend to relax and celebrate
my birthday with a lot of friends.Â I’ve been preparing lots of diamonds, twisted
pyramids, and truncated octagons for this occasion. I hope to find some gnarly Mexico cracks
to fill. HA!

Geode #12



Yay another geode! This one lives in Hollywood near The Music Box . During my interview with
KTLA last week you see me starting to build this one, folding and gluing some of the pieces. Good
thing I got this installed during the same weekâ€Š

Geode #12 is chrome in an attempt to compliment the orange-ish stucco that is the building. I
don’t know what this hole was there for, it was simply empty with no bricks surrounding and
didn’t lead anywhere. I’m excited to be branching out into Hollywood, expect a lot more in
the Mid City area for a while.

I had a small posse while installing this piece, my usual photographer Greg Tuzin and my
talented friend Jeni Wamberg . This was a late night install as you can tell by the photos, I love
the affect! We’ll swing by soon to get some day time photos.

Micro Geode Projection



This past week Greg and I had three friends ( Carmen , Jake , and Dustin ) visiting from San
Francisco and it was a whirlwind of collaboration, creation, and brainstorms.

My friend Carmen and I had one specific project we’ve been talking aboutâ€”to create a
micro projection on a geode. Image mapping is rapidly becoming something more artists are
exploring for visuals and installations, but it’s generally done very large. Large would
be amazing on these geodes, but we wanted to see how small we can go, a personal and unique
challenge.

We designed an image mapping over the shape of a 2″ x 2″ geode I created so that we could
isolate each of the “crystal” shapes and make them glow. The result was actually quite
fun! It looks like the individual crystals are sometimes glowing and pulsing.

We haven’t perfected it yet, but I wanted to post some of our results and process. We chose the
video below to show the scale of the actual piece (starring my cat Stampy), and the images are
various projections and angles of the piece. We’re thinking of eventually making this an
installation piece, but aren’t sure of where or what exactly. Stay tuned for more thoughts
and details as this project progresses!

Geode #11



Geode #11! The largest, darkest, and on the edge of the Arts District in LA. This one is located
right outside a local favorite bar, Tony’s . My friend Tim works there, found the spot for me,
and has kindly offered to help me secure this one behind a plastic sheet. It’ll eventually
look more like an “exhibit” outside with the cover on it. We decided to take these steps to
see if we can get this to last longer than the other large one that was
quicklyÂ removedÂ despite some small efforts.

I have to say I’m particularly excited about this one. I can’t use black for smaller ones
because I think they’ll be too hard to see, so I was happy to expand the palette a bit. And this
is my largest effort, something I hope to continue to grow in the future. I love the small
detailed treasures I’ve created but it would be nice to have some obvious public
artâ€”in addition.

Geode #10



Finally a new geode! Well, a new geode in an old placeâ€Š I’m retracing some steps here
and recreated a geode for the very first hole I ever used. This one is closer to home and I’m
hoping to test out some techniques on it and be able to monitor a bit. Never fear, I have a long
list of holes to fill all around the mid city area! Hopefully I can start getting them out
faster, life happens and production slows from time to time.

Besides that, I’m super excited by the new mutation! I found a metallic blue which is a little
too sparkly for my taste but it turned out nice anyways. I also added a golden “growth” to
this geode. Many geodes have two toned crystals growing off of each other and I decided to give
it a try. I’m in love! And can’t wait to keep playing with this.

Missing Art Installation, Voicemail 1



Happy friday! First off, I want to thank everyone for all your amazing comments of support,
ideas, and criticism. I’m not stressed by my latest geode being taken any longer; I think I
was more shocked at the time that its life was so short (the shortest of any piece) and that my
first attempt to extend its life utterly failed. I’ve always had a hard time with
“starting over” when things don’t work out the first time.

I do believe the beauty of this project is that these pieces are temporary, that’s why I
started out not even trying to glue them. They were all just placed into their little homes. If
these are truly urban treasures that parody natures’ treasures, “humans are a force”
that affects them too (thank you to my genius sister Kara).

Now! For the fun part. You all saw my “missing” art installation to replace my art
installation? I received my first google voicemail today! This kind fellow let me know that he
has “no information about [my] missing art”. Click the play button below to hear:

Missing! Purple, Shiny, and Awesome!



Below is my first reaction to my stolen geodes. The public used to have a cool piece of art, now
they get an ugly sheet of paper. I made a google voice number just for the occasion, it’d be
great to actually get a call, though I don’t plan on it! Maybe it’ll be from the
cityâ€Špissed off that I wheat pasted something uglier than they tore out? This is
hopefully more permanent.

I don’t think this belongs in every place a geode has been taken, but this large metal surface
was just asking for a replacement. I cannot make a new one as I can see where they tore the geode
out (the glue is still there) and they would do it again.

I had a dream last night that someone had written down an address on my sign to where it was. I went
there and saw it was removed to a shitty storefront and I actuallyÂ had to “steal” it
back. Kind of a fun dream, but also irritating to my psyche.

Artist Rant



The purpose of this post is just to rant.

I passed by my latest geode last night, the large purple one, and it was gone! â€ŠWhat the
hell? I’m perplexed on this oneâ€”it stood up to the kind of heavy rain a day after it
went in, it’s in a piece of obsolete pay phone encasing, and it was pretty. This is the most
frustrating of the bunch because either it was stolen purely because someone really loved it
and wanted it for their own or because the city is a bunch of dicks and said, “We just can’t
have this art just sitting in this city property, harumph”. They had to go through the
trouble of tearing it out because it was glued too.

This is incredibly frustrating in every way. I really don’t care that they don’t last long
for other reasons besides just plain being taken. I work incredibly hard to make these and
spend all my extra time and don’t have much free time besides half the weekend. I’m feeling
like I took big steps forward last week with new work and a little press only to take twice as many
giant steps back this week. I feel like people are bad, coming at me from all sides and
personally attacking me (this comes from other issues in addition!).

Anyways, the conclusion I’ve come to is that I’m going to finish the ones I have going right
now and not do them any more. At least the way that I’m doing them. It’s so much work and only
four still existâ€”three of which I was actually asked to do. I am, however, attempting
to create them in other ways that do not take as long, but they will look completely different.
Idea still there, method dead.

Geode #9



How timely! A purple geode on Valentine’s day… I installed this bad boy last night on
Spring Street between 6th and 7th in downtown LA. This is the largest geode so far, and the first
official colored one. I bought a glossy purple, which I’m not completely satisfied with the
tone but I sprinkled some silver to help it shine a little and let it be. I’m still on the search
for metallic colors if anyone knows where to find some.

These are some quick photos I took today from my iphone, we’re going to do a better photo shoot
tonight so stay tuned for more.

A huge shout out and thank you to my friend Consuelo Chozas , who cut out the majority of the
pieces to construct this one. She’s an incredible help!

Geode #8



My friend Consuelo just took an amazing photo of geode #8 at Daily Dose . When we took our fancy
photos last week, we didn’t have a stand to take photos in the dark lit cafe so we got this
lovely iPhone flash/instagram action going on in this one. Just wanted to post this
moreÂ detailedÂ photo up to show off the teeny tiny pieces I made in this one.

Geodes 6, 7, and 8



Late last week I installed three new geodes in one location. They live at The Daily Dose , a
little gem of a cafe in the Arts District of downtown LA. Sarkis, the owner, saw my geodes on
Facebook and asked if I would add some to the cafe. Hell yes I will!

These three geodes are the most difficult I’ve done by far. They took me over three weeks to
create, which is average for three geodes, but the amount of time per day put in was tripled.
Each piece was precious since I knew they would be in a place where customers would be sitting
for long periods of time, able to see every flaw.

Geodes number 7 and 8 were the challenging ones, the molds crumbled when I took them out.
Putting them back together was a puzzle piece nightmare. I had to make both their casts twice
because I made the glue mixture too strong and couldn’t get them off the molds. Also, while
gluing the pieces in, I was constantly stressed and checking whether the folded nooks and
crannies of the pieces would be too filled or if the whole piece was maleable enough for when I
placed them in.

So much time and stress and these pieces were successfully created. I can’t believe they fit
and I don’t know how big a puddle on the ground I would have melted into if it they didn’t.

Test Geode



For a long while I’ve known that I needed to figure out how to create geodes to fit into real
cracks. I can’t depend on finding perfect pipes and missing bricks forever and I really
can’t imagine spending hours longer gluing pieces directly into holes in the middle of the
night. I’ve been scheming up this process that I’ve confirmed todayâ€”works!

Below is an image of a tester I made in our house. I wanted to do it inside so I could have control
over the situation if anything didn’t work or needed extra time and care. The process
includes making a mold of the crack, creating a cast of the mold with gauze-like cloth and
homemade “size”, and following the rest of my old steps to completion. The inner shapes
here are technically too large, I just used some extra pieces I had that would at least fit.

I rounded out this geode with a glossy red spray paint. I like it for our house because it kind of
matches, but it doesn’t quite pop enough for the outside world. I am still on the hunt for
metallics in other colors.

What IS a Geode?



My sister had a brilliant idea today. We’ve been noticing not everyone knows what a geode is
or how exactly to pronounce it. We also noticed that many people do know what they are, they just
don’t know they know what they are. The idea was to post about what geodes actually are to help
people see where this project has evolved from. Thanks for the helpÂ  Wikipedia ! (sorry for
the not great quality of the photos, I liked these examples most)

From Wikipedia

Geodes Â ( Greek Â  Î³ÎµÏŽÎŽÎ·Ï‚ – ge-Å�dÄ“s ,
“earthlike”) areÂ  geological Â secondary sedimentary structures which occur
inÂ  sedimentary Â and certainÂ  volcanic Â rocks. Geodes are essentially
spherical masses of mineral matter that were deposited syngenetically within the rock
formations they are found in. Geodes have aÂ  chalcedony Â shell containing various
minerals, usuallyÂ  quartz . Geodes differ fromÂ  vugs Â in that they were formed as a
separate entity from the surrounding rock, whereas vugs are voids or cavities within a rock
formation. Geodes also differ from “nodules” in that a nodule is a mass of mineral matter
that has accreted around the nodule nucleous. Both structures had the minerals contained
within deposited from groundwater or hydrothermal processes. The exterior of most geodes
generally consists of chalcedony, a cryptocrystalline form of quartz. Inside the
chalcedony shell many minerals have been found such asÂ  calcite ,Â  pyrite ,Â 
kaolinite ,Â  sphalerite ,Â  millerite ,Â  barite ,Â  dolomite ,Â  limonite
,Â  smithsonite Â and quartz, which is by far the most common and abundant mineral found
in geodes. Geodes are found mostly inÂ  basaltic Â  lavas Â andÂ  limestones .
TheÂ  Warsaw Formation Â in theÂ  Keokuk Â region near the area where Missouri,
Iowa, and Illinois join contains abundant geodes.

 

Formation



Geodes can form in any cavity, but the term is usually reserved for more or less rounded
formations in igneous and sedimentary rocks, while the more general term “vug” is
applied to cavities in fissures and veins. They can form in gas bubbles inÂ  igneous rocks ,
such as vesicles in basalticÂ  lavas , or as in the AmericanÂ  Midwest , rounded cavities
in sedimentary formations. After rock around the cavity hardens, dissolvedÂ  silicates
Â and/orÂ  carbonates Â are deposited on the inside surface. Over time, this slow
feed of mineral constituents fromÂ  groundwater Â orÂ  hydrothermal Â solutions
allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber. Bedrock containing geodes eventually
weathers and decomposes, leaving them present at the surface if they are composed of
resistant material such as quartz.

Geode #5, Venice CA



My 5th geode has just been installed. This sort of replaces my 2nd geode that was recently
stolen out of its pipe, hopefully this one lasts longer (it’s going to be hard to rip this
sucker out, wink). Technically this one’s color is “brass” but it looks a lot like the
“gold”, I’ll be switching up the colors of these soon.

The location of this new geode is at 1661 Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice CA, my first geode on
the west side. Happy new year!

Geode #3, Deterioration



There were heavy rains (which means a heavy sprinkling in LA) in December. The third geode I
created, in the corner of a building on Spring between 7th and 8th, has started to fall apart and
deteriorate. The images below show how parts of it have fallen off onto the sidewalk and left
some gaping holes in the geode construction.

Now this is something I was prepared for and am happy about. I know these are all
“temporary” installations because of people and weather. I realized after two geodes
were stolen that I can’t really emotionally deal with the people problem, but I can deal with
the weather problem. Erosion is so cool, it’s a natural response to nature and the effects I
think are still beautiful. Paper does unfortunately erode incredibly quick so I do plan on
starting to explore other materials. I’d also like to find a way to combat the “people
problem”, but I’m not sure I want to disclose that yet. To be continuedâ€Š
