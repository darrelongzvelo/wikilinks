His works include short stories and novels in both Shona and English. He also writes poetry, but views it as a &quot;mere finger exercise.&quot; He has a wide range, including anti-colonial writings and children\'s books. While the colonial regime initially banned his work, he now writes about post-colonial oppression as well. The awards he won include the Noma Award in 1992 and the Commonwealth Writers Prize (Africa Region) twice in the years 1988 and 1998.

I don\'t know how these things come about, but I think my parents wanted me to be something else, and even as late as, well, just before Walking Still was published, which is about five years ago, my mother said, &quot;I\'d wish you\'d burn your library&quot;. Anyway, she didn\'t mean it and some good things have happened also. It probably has got to do with having your nose in the book and hardly saying anything at all to anyone; I am talking about when I was growing up.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            But I always want to think that it was the loneliness, the way I grew up that led to my choice of career. It was not a career that I chose, I think it chose me. Traditionally in Shona culture you live in a round village and with the head of the kraal, somewhere there. But some time in the 1950s my father had to move from our village to start a farm of his own, a farm in the modern sense, with machines and all the modern technology, although not that productive.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            This farm was about 17-something acres and you could get out with 20, 25 to 30 head of cattle for the whole day, feeding on wild fruits and you did not come back home until probably five o\'clock in the evening. So most of the time I was alone and when I could read, which was five years after I started school, four or five years, I could read very well in both English and Shona. I always had books with me.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/Swzcs_6SmwI/AAAAAAAAAMI/ZR_QnqcPuUs/s1600/Ndiko_Kupindana_Kwamazuva_cHARLES+MUNGOSHI.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" shape="rect">\n                              <img \n                              alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/Swzcs_6SmwI/AAAAAAAAAMI/ZR_QnqcPuUs/s400/Ndiko_Kupindana_Kwamazuva_cHARLES+MUNGOSHI.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 268px; height: 400px;" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5407939918193400578">\n</img>\n                            </a>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            I am the first son and first child and after me there were three girls, then four boys, and as a boy you are expected to work with men. I didn\'t have any friends on this farm; the nearest friend was about a mile or so away. We were not allowed to visit anyone at all, not because they were cruel, but there was so much work to do on the farm and I was supposed to be always there, minding the cattle or running errands, and so on.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Even when I started going to school, my father would go to the school and tell the headmaster that his son would not be attending the Sunday school because he was the only one he had to help him on the farm.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            And in school, when on Monday, Wednesday and Friday pupils stayed over after school \xe2\x80\x93 which closed at about 1 o\'clock \xe2\x80\x93 to do sports or outdoor games, my father made sure that I didn\'t join the other pupils in those games.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            My sisters being girls, I couldn\'t heard cattle with them. I couldn\'t work with them because they were women and they would be with our mother doing other things, so I was always almost on my own. When I was with my father, you can imagine the kind of conversation we had, &quot;Pick that&quot;, &quot;Did I say to?&quot;, &quot;Did I tell you to?&quot;, &quot;Run!&quot; and so on, so you would wish to be as far away from him as possible.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            So most of my life was really lived in my head and talking to trees and birds and animals. So I want to think the loneliness, being on my own, turned me sort of inside and the reading helped along. It wasn\'t long before I thought, &quot;Well, I think I can also write a story&quot;. I think that\'s what happened.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            What kind of reading, do you remember?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            The very first book I read and I could only identify words like \'this\' and \xe2\x80\x98was\' and \'it\' and \'the\', something like that, but I couldn\'t tell how the story went. But I remember very well the title, it was &quot;Flamingo Island&quot; and I loved the sound of the word \'flamingo\'. I would say that word \'flamingo\' and I thought it was wonderful. I didn\'t know what it meant.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Later on there was a proliferation of Second World War comics and cowboy comics, American literature, I think, from a publisher called Dell. These are the kind of comics I read. I didn\'t realise that then, but I think from very early I was a victim of the power of the word, so from reading those comics I easily identified with the heroes there and I found I cultivated a hatred for the Germans, or the Jerries as they were called in these comics, and the Nips or the Japs, as the Americans put it, and I was several cowboys. I never thought about the Red Indians. They were my enemies and I looked down upon them.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            At that time there was not much literature from here. We are looking at 1959 and the oldest published Shona novel had been published in 1956. Then there was of course the Christian Bible the Bible, and it was in a very weird, very old print with letters and it was hard to read. It had been translated I think by some very enthusiastic white missionary. Some of what was supposed to be poetry, sounded very strange to the ear. Well, nobody read much, they read the Bible but otherwise what we called stories we heard from our grandmothers.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            I think I became a writer was simply something out of this loneliness, I had to make something out of my life. I was amassing a lot of words and you either sing them or you shout them, you have to do something with those words, and I started putting together stories.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            So did you do that already in school?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            I did. I remember; the first poem I wrote was when I was the first year in school. I had to ask somebody how to spell the name of a certain girl who sat next to me. I wrote the word down and sent the letter to her. I think that\'s the first poem I wrote. Siphiwe.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            So it\'s a one-word poem?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Yes, a one word poem with a whole lot of feelings behind it. Later on I wrote about valleys and mountains and trees and then the inevitable longer poem, longer version of Siphiwe, &quot;The Love Story&quot;, which was published in a school magazine. And 4-years later in secondary school, 2-years away from my leaving school for good, I had a story published in a commercial magazine in Harare , Zimbabwe , and the following year another story. These stories were of course love stories and adventure stories. At that time I used to believe that a good story should have about two deaths on every page and a lot of blood right from page one to the end and so on and a bit of the bedroom scene, that was a good story as far as I was concerned.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Later on it came as a surprise when I was reading some English short stories in the school library. I read some stories, for instance, Ernest Hemingway\'s stories, and there didn\'t seem to be anything happening in those stories. I mean you can have a love story without people sleeping together; you can have a murder story without anyone being killed on the page and so on. It was something about the shot, the sound of the gunshot when the curtain is closed, that was something from Chekov I suppose, and the whole thing about writing a story in a manner that leaves a lot unsaid. I got interested in that and I found myself writing stories.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            But what had happened again was this loneliness, which did not end by going to school. In fact I think it worsened because I couldn\'t sort of get myself together to become part of the other pupils at school. I think the final rift between myself and being part of whatever crowd I was supposed to have been part of came when I was, I think, thirteen and we were playing football. I always tried to avoid games where competition was required because I\'d never lived or stayed with anyone or competed with anyone in anything, everything I did it by myself and I was the best by myself. So whenever I found myself competing I always came out the worst. So I was goalkeeper in this and somebody kicked the ball right on me and I fell back and I think I must have been out for two hours, and from there I hated football or any games that could kill, could hurt somebody.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            From there I think I became friends with just my books and walking through the forest and I would maybe avoid going to, play truant from church and go out into the bush. I was very good at hunting for fruit and people like me for the strange fruits that I brought from the bush.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            So when your stories got published and won these competitions, your parents were not very proud?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            No, they were not. In fact what happened with this loneliness the other thing I did was I started keeping a diary. It was very strange, after writing about a painful experience, I felt very relaxed, very refreshed and very cheerful and in fact I became a kind of clown, I think. There was a kind of euphoria after writing a story or something that really pained me I became very funny. I don\'t know how to say it but one of the things that I became good at is acting on stage and so on.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            And I think that also served me, that held me from writing gory stories, melodramatic stories into writing actually the kind of writing that I\'m writing now, when.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Do you think that literature in Zimbabwe has gone through a stage of literature for education and social/political values?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Yes, when I went to school the teachers wrote on the black board &quot;Think in English, Talk in English, Act in English&quot;. So they were very serious about education and that is what they taught. In secondary school we had plays, simplified stories; we had Shakespeare, we had Oliver Twist \xe2\x80\x93 all those stories. Some I don\'t know where they came from but I had those in primary school and in secondary school.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Well, I meant after independence. Some say that the early literature of independent Zimbabwe was not sort of following the nationalist call?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            OK, looking at literature in Zimbabwe, and books like my \'Waiting for the Rain\', Stanley Nyamfukudza\'s \'Non-Believer\'s Journey\', Dambudzo Marechera\'s \'House of Hunger\' and the other books \xe2\x80\x93 yes, they were seen as books without political ideologies, without any historical content, and as books that are individual or egoistic, and all that kind of things; there was nothing at all that would help there.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            And our only response was that it was at least an analysis of and we were looking into the individual to see how and why the individual suffers and could you please offer an answer, if there is any answer? It\'s simply a laying open of what is bothering, a diagnosis of what\'s wrong with us, and they said, &quot;No, ideologically this is empty&quot;.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            But then, only recently I hear, and it\'s the same university and probably these might have been students in secondary school but now they are the lecturers, they are talking of this same book of mine again. I haven\'t changed a single word, but now they say it means something, this is one of the greatest things that have happened too. So it is interesting in the light of talk on self-censorship that a criticism of the present seems to have been written already in a book many years ago, which was then stamped as being ideologically empty.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Q. You have written your short stories, novels, and columns, but you have also translated, for example, Ngugi wa Thiongo\'s The Grain of Wheat. Could you tell us why you did that, and what that novel meant to you?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            I was editor of a publishing house and we were all eyes open, looking around for the great novel of out of the struggle. I felt very bad, I couldn\'t write the Shona war novel. I really liked \'The Grain of Wheat\', it was skilfully plotted and it did not tell that this is how it was, and this is right and this is wrong, and he has complex characters, and gave alternative interpretations.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            And I felt reading The Grain of Wheat it that it was almost the same as in Zimbabwe, the British of the Highlands, the farms and the people living in the compounds and the people of the land dissatisfied, the educational system, the same sort of characters, headmasters and so on and the priests, all of it. I felt that Mau Mau was just like our Chimurenga.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            So I felt that this would be of some help to the Shona writers who were trying to write about the war. I am not sure whether any of our authors did get inspired by it or learnt how to chisel the characters. But some have later written very well about the struggle, not as speeches but as subjective experiences, such as Alexander Kanengoni. \'Effortless Tears\', I think that is one wonderful story.

As speakers from across the political divide and those representing the Christian community said, Rev Banana was, despite his weaknesses, a good and patriotic Zimbabwean. He played a very crucial role in the liberation struggle and in the unification of the country following the early 1980s Matabeleland troubles. He did justice, he loved mercy, he walked humbly with his God.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Banana was born in 1936 in Esiphezini Communal Area, Southern Rhodesia near Esigodini (now in Matabeleland South). His parents were a Ndebele-cultured mother and a Malawian father who had emigrated to Rhodesia. He was educated by missionaries in a local school and later studied at a teacher training institute.[1]\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            He married Janet Mbuyazwe[2] in 1961, and they had four children together. He took a diploma in theology at Epworth Theological College in Harare and was ordained as a United Methodist minister in 1962. He was a student at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C. in 1974 and 1975. Becoming involved in politics, he denounced Ian Smith\'s practices as a prime minister, took part in the rising[3] transnational black liberation ideo-religious movements, and came to be vice-president of the African National Council.[1]\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            He wrote a book entitled The Gospel According To The Ghetto, and a personalised version of the Lord\'s Prayer.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Banana was born in 1936 in Esiphezini Communal Area, Southern Rhodesia near Esigodini (now in Matabeleland South).

In 1997, Banana was arrested in Zimbabwe on charges of sodomy, following accusations made during the murder trial of his former bodyguard, Jefta Dube.[1] The charges related to allegations from the state prosecutor that Banana had misused his power while he was president to coerce numerous men in positions of service (ranging from domestic staff to security guards, and even members of sports teams for whom he had acted as referee) into accepting sexual advances. Banana was found guilty of eleven charges of sodomy, attempted sodomy and indecent assault in 1998. He denied all charges, saying that homosexuality is &quot;defiant, abominable and wrong&quot;, and the allegations made against him were &quot;pathological lies&quot; intended to destroy his political career.[5] Janet Banana later acknowledged her husband\'s indiscretions, even though she considered the charges against him to be politically motivated.[6]\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwzPgA701uI/AAAAAAAAALQ/oio87MR2WCw/s1600/CANAAN+BANANA+ZIMBABWE+WITH+ROBERT+MUGABE.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" shape="rect">\n                              <img \n                              alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwzPgA701uI/AAAAAAAAALQ/oio87MR2WCw/s400/CANAAN+BANANA+ZIMBABWE+WITH+ROBERT+MUGABE.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 268px;" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5407925401478813410">\n</img>\n                            </a>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            He fled to South Africa whilst released on bail before he could be imprisoned, apparently believing Mugabe was planning his death. He returned to Zimbabwe in December 1998, after a meeting with Nelson Mandela, who convinced him to face the ruling. Banana was sentenced on 18 January 1999 to ten years in jail, nine years suspended, and was also defrocked. He actually served six months in an open prison before being released in January 2001.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            On 10 November 2003, Banana died of cancer,[7] in London, according to a report delivered by the Zimbabwean High Commissioner. The Guardian, a London-based newspaper, has claimed that Banana had traveled to South Africa, where he eventually died, in order to receive appropriate treatment for his cancer; however, this dispute relies upon uncorroborated testimonial evidence.[1] He was buried in Zimbabwe in late November 2003. President Robert Mugabe called him &quot;a rare gift to the nation&quot; in a radio address.[8] Banana was buried without the full honours that are traditionally accorded to former heads of state.[4] The then politburo Secretary for Information and Publicity Nathan Shamuyarira told state radio that &quot;they (the politburo) could not accord Banana hero status as a matter of principle.&quot;[9] His wife sought political asylum in Britain in October 2000 under a preexisting accord.[4]\n                            <div style="clear: both;"></div>\n                          </div>\n                          <div class="post-footer">\n                            <div class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1">\n                              <span class="post-timestamp"> </span>\n                              <span class="post-comment-link"> </span>\n                              <span class="post-icons"> </span>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-2"></div>\n                            <div class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-3"></div>\n                          </div>\n                        </div>\n                      </div>\n                      <div class="post-outer">\n                        <div class="post hentry">\n                          <a name="4912452327640781110" shape="rect"></a>\n                          <h3 class="post-title entry-title">\n                            <a href="http://100greatestzimbabweans.blogspot.com/2009/11/mark-chavhunduka-journalist-publisher.html" shape="rect">MARK CHAVHUNDUKA JOURNALIST &amp;

At that time, anyone could enter the Zimbabwe open and you could find yourself playing Byron in the first round.\n                            <div style="clear: both;"></div>\n                          </div>\n                          <div class="post-footer">\n                            <div class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1">\n                              <span class="post-timestamp"> </span>\n                              <span class="post-comment-link"> </span>\n                              <span class="post-icons"> </span>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-2"></div>\n                            <div class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-3"></div>\n                          </div>\n                        </div>\n                      </div>\n                      <div class="post-outer">\n                        <div class="post hentry">\n                          <a name="614467806718937234" shape="rect"></a>\n                          <h3 class="post-title entry-title">\n                            <a href="http://100greatestzimbabweans.blogspot.com/2009/11/simon-chopper-chimbetu-100-greatest.html" shape="rect">SIMON CHOPPER CHIMBETU 100 GREATEST ZIMBABWEANS</a>\n                          </h3>\n                          <div class="post-header-line-1"></div>\n                          <div class="post-body entry-content">\n                            <p> </p>\n                            <div style="float:left; margin-right:10px;">\n                              <script type="text/javascript"> digg_url = \'http://100greatestzimbabweans.blogspot.com/2009/11/simon-chopper-chimbetu-100-greatest.html\'; </script>\n                              <script type="text/javascript" src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js"></script>\n                            </div>\n                            <script type="text/javascript">&lt;!-- google_ad_client = &quot;ca-pub-8015666080146768&quot;; google_ad_host = &quot;pub-1556223355139109&quot;; /* 336x280, created 2/22/09 */ google_ad_slot = &quot;9122448922&quot;; google_ad_width = 336; google_ad_height = 280; //--&gt; </script>\n                            <script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"> </script>\n                            <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwnM1rQX0rI/AAAAAAAAAJI/_o9AnaPkrN0/s1600/SIMON+CHIMBETU+100+GREATEST+ZIMBABWEANS.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" shape="rect">\n                              <img \n                              alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwnM1rQX0rI/AAAAAAAAAJI/_o9AnaPkrN0/s400/SIMON+CHIMBETU+100+GREATEST+ZIMBABWEANS.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 210px; height: 270px;" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5407078050151518898">\n</img>\n                            </a>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Simon &quot;Chopper&quot; Chimbetu, one of \xe2\x80\x99s most successful and beloved local musicians died on Sunday, August 14, in Harare .  He was 50.  A veteran of Harare \xe2\x80\x99s intense nightlife for over two decades, Chimbetu saw his highs and lows.  As he died, he was emerging from controversy surrounding his backing of the government\xe2\x80\x99s land-grab policy.   But his 2004 album \xe2\x80\x9c10 Million Pound Reward\xe2\x80\x9d was bringing him back into public favor in recent months.  Six years earlier, when I lived in Harare, Chimbetu\xe2\x80\x99s shows were the top draw in Harare, as stylish, polished, and tuneful a take on Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s own brand of guitar-based rumba\xe2\x80\x94sometimes called sungura\xe2\x80\x94as you could find.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Chimbetu was born and raised in Makwiru, Chegutu area, Mashonaland West in 1955.  His parents were amateur musicians, and he fondly recalled his father drumming and his mother singing when he was a child.  During the liberation war he and his three brothers and four sisters lived on Dendera Farm in Mozmbique.  He returned after independence to work with a pioneering sungura band called The Marxist Brothers.  When we spoke in 2001, he seemed a little embarrassed about the name, calling it a \xe2\x80\x9cnickname,\xe2\x80\x9d and explaining that it made more sense in the afterglow of the independence struggle, which was supported by communists in the USSR and China.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwnNYsKn5YI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/aNJihzhVR5Y/s1600/SIMON+CHIMBETU+ZIMBABWE+LIVE+IN+ACTION.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" shape="rect">\n                              <img \n                              alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwnNYsKn5YI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/aNJihzhVR5Y/s400/SIMON+CHIMBETU+ZIMBABWE+LIVE+IN+ACTION.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 278px; height: 400px;" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5407078651691263362">\n</img>\n                            </a>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            When he formed his own band in the early 90s, he called it the Dendera Kings.  The name harks back to his experience during the war years, but as he explained in 2001, it has a deeper meaning.  \xe2\x80\x9cDendera is an African bird,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is found in tropical savannah areas.  In English it is called a ground hornbill.  It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a big bird.  Why we chose that title is that the bird can be heard from 10 km away.  Very early in the morning, it produces a powerful sound, like a drum.  That is a very respected bird in the region.\xe2\x80\x9d   The band too was very respected, producing over 15 albums, and performing long, ecstatic shows all over the country.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <object height="265" width="320">\n                              <param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/T1bwMGF_4hE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00" name="movie" valuetype="data"></param>\n                              <param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" valuetype="data"></param>\n                              <param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess" valuetype="data"></param>\n                              <embed height="265" width="320" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/T1bwMGF_4hE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00"></embed>\n                            </object>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Chimbetu was never a political singer, but he did address social issues, and sometimes that was perceived as political.  \xe2\x80\x9cI think when you are a writer, a musician, an artist,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9can artist is mostly concerned about the poor.  An artist is supposed to be concerned with the majority of the people.  That\xe2\x80\x99s where we belong.\xe2\x80\x9d  His 2000 song \xe2\x80\x9cNdare Newa\xe2\x80\x9d dramatized the plight of workers who spent their entire Friday paycheck by Sunday night, and had to scrounge all week before receiving another.  The song stirred minor controversy as some took it as implicitly critical of the government.  His loyalty to the Mugabe regime was later reinforced, however, when he participated in its aggressive land grab policy by occupying a 500 hectare farm in Kadoma.  At the same time, he spoke out against violence and declared himself \xe2\x80\x9ca friend to all Zimbabweans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <object height="265" width="320">\n                              <param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Dvob1kYJKjQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00" name="movie" valuetype="data"></param>\n                              <param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" valuetype="data"></param>\n                              <param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess" valuetype="data"></param>\n                              <embed height="265" width="320" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Dvob1kYJKjQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00"></embed>\n                            </object>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            The farm episode nevertheless cost him some popular support, but at the time of his death, he was clearly on the rebound, playing frequent shows in the as well as .  A journalist in 2004 described him as \xe2\x80\x9cfit as a fiddle,\xe2\x80\x9d and reports say he died quickly from an \xe2\x80\x9cundisclosed illness.\xe2\x80\x9d   When he was buried on August 17, hoards of people clogged the streets of Harare .

While teaching, she noticed that girls were dropping out of school at an alarming rate. She approached her students with an idea.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            &quot;I [said] to girls, \'Let\'s have our own space where we talk and find solutions,\' &quot; Makoni said.

Makoni said she was not surprised: &quot;Every woman and girl identified with the issues that we were raising,&quot; she said.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            In 2000, she quit her teaching job to volunteer with GCN full time. &quot;I decided to become an advocate because I walked my own journey to survival,&quot; she said.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            The following year Makoni successfully procured a piece of land and opened the organization\'s first empowerment village, designed to provide a haven for girls who have been abused. Girls are either rescued or referred to the village by social services, the police and the community. The healing begins as soon as a girl arrives.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            &quot;In the first 72 hours, a girl is provided with emergency medication, reinstatement in school, as well as counseling,&quot; said Makoni.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            It is important to her that the girls are in charge of their own healing. &quot;It gives them the confidence to transform from victims to leaders,&quot; she explained.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            The process helped Hope work through the times when she said &quot;I thought my life had come to end.&quot;\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            &quot;They offered all they could ... as I was in a traumatized state,&quot; she said. &quot;I really appreciate what [Betty Makoni] has done and is doing in my life.&quot;\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Today, GCN has grown to 700 girls\' clubs and three empowerment villages across Zimbabwe.

In 2008, she was forced to flee her native country. &quot;I left Zimbabwe because my life was in danger as a result of my project being interpreted politically.&quot;\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Today, she lives with her family in the United Kingdom.

Nyarota also served as editor of\n                            <em>The Chronicle</em>\n                            ,              a daily in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe\'s second largest city.

As a result,              the government, which owned the paper, removed Nyarota as editor.              He then moved to\n                            <em>The Financial Gazette</em>\n                            , a weekly business              and financial newspaper, and later joined the Nordic-Sadc Journalism              Centre in Maputo, Mozambique.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            On his return to Zimbabwe in 1999, Nyarota              founded\n                            <em>The Daily News</em>\n                            , the country\'s only independent daily              newspaper. The newspaper\'s aggressive efforts to uncover corruption              and human rights abuses made it the most widely read paper in the              country. On Dec. 30, 2002, Nyarota was fired as editor on what management              said were administrative grounds. But his dismissal came amid an escalating              campaign by President Robert Mugabe\'s government to quiet criticism              from independent news outlets. Nyarota fled to South Africa after              police visited his home at midnight.

Under her maiden name, Kubi Chaza, she was an actress in the UK, appearing in Live and Let Die in 1973 as a saleswoman picking up James Bond. After returning to Zimbabwe, she and actor husband John Indi started a company making beauty products specifically for black skin and African hair. Kubi is now a well known brand in southern Africa.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Indi is very active in the development community, particularly with respect to issues affecting women, and is secretary-general of the Indigenous Business Women\'s Organisation in Zimbabwe.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            The Indis have continued to work in film-making, John as an actor, but Kubi on both sides of the camera.

In 1993 she played the eponymous heroine\'s modern neighbour in Neria, Tsitsi Dangarembga\'s script about widowhood in Zimbabwe.

Some kids had all these grand ambitions of being doctors and so on, but I never really set myself a target.

I liked running, long jump and football. I did everything, I was a proper athlete and I was quick. I think I set the 100m and 200m records at Mhali Primary School in Bulawayo.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            I lost interest in running when I got to secondary, because I got more hooked on football. At that time, I was inspired by Ian Wright. I followed his career like religion, and I liked his natural goal scoring ability. I guess that makes me an Arsenal supporter, yes I was!\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <object height="265" width="320">\n                              <param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/uHj8ZAMC7DQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00" name="movie" valuetype="data"></param>\n                              <param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" valuetype="data"></param>\n                              <param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess" valuetype="data"></param>\n                              <embed height="265" width="320" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/uHj8ZAMC7DQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00"></embed>\n                            </object>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            What would you say has been the highlight of your career?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            I think more than anything else I would say playing for all these years in Europe. It\xe2\x80\x99s the hardest thing to break into European teams and I have managed it at four teams. I have scored some memorable goals along the way. Two goals stand out -- one scored against Barcelona when I was still at Grasshoppers, and the other for Jomo Cosmos against Kaizer Chiefs. The goals were almost similar in that I just stepped out of the centre circle and struck the ball sweetly into the nets.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            What habit do you wish you could change?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            I am always sleeping when I have nothing to do.

I have a short temper, but now I am trying to be calmer. There are a lot of things that get me upset, because usually when you have a short temper, you easily get angry at the slightest provocation. Sometimes you get upset but handle it better. I guess it goes with patience, I have no patience. When I want something, I want it done there and then. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            What are you most afraid of?\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Ships and planes!

He was born to parents of Malawian descent and like Benjani Mwaruwari chose to represent his nation of birth, Zimbabwe, internationally.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Moses Chunga is considered by many football enthusiasts as arguably the greatest football player ever produced in Zimbabwe.

However, there seems to be some verifiable facts about him that give him his legendary status. For example, Moses Chunga was the first (black) Zimbabwean to join a European league (after independence). Only one or a very few (Black) player(s) \xe2\x80\x93 e.g., Freddie Mukwesha- appear to have achieved this feat before him, although many more were to follow his footsteps, some joining much better leagues than the Belgian second division, which he had played for (e.g., Peter Ndlovu, Benjani Mwaruwari, Norman Mapeza etc). Therefore, those who question Moses Chunga\xe2\x80\x99s brilliance point out that he never managed to play for Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite leagues.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/Swmkvynh4iI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/3kt4iqAbvhc/s1600/chunga+moses.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" shape="rect">\n                              <img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/Swmkvynh4iI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/3kt4iqAbvhc/s400/chunga+moses.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 250px; height: 167px;" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5407033968583369250"></img>\n                            </a>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Chunga is also revered for being a midfielder who managed to score a record 46 goals in a single season, a record that has stood ever since; for being a dead ball specialist who could even score from corner kicks, an exceptionally good passer of the ball, and a dribbling wizard. For example, it is widely rumored that he once dribbled and bamboozled a defender to the point where he back peddled and twisted his knee causing a career ending injury. As a crowd puller, it appears Moses Chunga sometimes enjoyed playing to the gallery, which included standing on the ball.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Sunday Marimo, the former Zimbabwe National Team coach, who led Zimbabwe to its first appearance at the African Cup Nations final in 2006, admitted that Zimbabwe \xe2\x80\x9clacks a natural ball player, a playmaker in the mould of Moses Chunga\xe2\x80\x9d.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Chunga\xe2\x80\x99s professional career fizzled out within less than 5 years in Belgium, possibly because of a knee-injury. He tried his luck with his former team Dynamos after quitting his Belgian team, but it never really worked out well for him on the field, forcing him to retire from playing. He then began his coaching career, which has produced mixed results, but which most football followers in Zimbabwe would consider an utter failure.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            For all his brilliance on the football field, it appears Moses Chunga had some major flaws in his personality. It is widely believed, for example, that he refused to play for the Zimbabwe National Team during his days in Belgium as they were offering him \xe2\x80\x9cpeanuts\xe2\x80\x9d. This is difficult to verify. However, what can be said with certainty is that he is an assertive character, which does not seem a common trait in the cultural environs of Zimbabwe. Therefore, people may struggle to understand or accept him.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Moses Chunga\'s legendary status was not misplaced as he truly was a genius with a ball, although he did like to take the mickey out of other players on the football field. He arguably rivals people like David Beckham as a dead ball specialist. He was however stubborn to the point of obstinacy which is why some national coaches could not work with him and left him out of the Zimbabwe national teams (especially the European coaches).

He would play a significant role in two major teams, Bobby Gould\'s attacking team of the early 90s and Ron Atkinson-Gordon Strachan\'s expansive squad of the mid-late 1990s.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwmcOU26bHI/AAAAAAAAAGo/B7iFtlceJLs/s1600/peter+nsukuzonke+ndlovu+zimbabwe.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" shape="rect">\n                              <img \n                              alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/SwmcOU26bHI/AAAAAAAAAGo/B7iFtlceJLs/s400/peter+nsukuzonke+ndlovu+zimbabwe.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 315px; height: 320px;" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5407024597566123122">\n</img>\n                            </a>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Bobby Gould\'s team in 1992/93 must surely go down as the archetypal under-achievers. Having acquired the legendary striker Micky Quinn in November 1992 they continued what had already been a blistering start, with away wins at Tottenham Hotspur (2-0) Sheffield Wednesday (2-1) and Wimbledon (2-1) to add to already impressive home wins against the likes of Middlesbrough (2-1). By the early autumn the Sky Blues briefly topped the inaugural Premier league and would only lose five league games prior to Christmas. The addition of Micky Quinn to the squad led to further outstanding home wins against the likes of Aston Villa (3-0) and Liverpool (5-1). They would eventually go to Championship contenders Blackburn Rovers and leave with a (5-2) victory in February 1993. However, a barren March/April programme and a run in that would see back to back games against Man Utd, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leeds Utd saw them slip from 5th in the league in February to 15th by the end of May. A league position secured with a thrilling performance from Ndlovu in a last day 3-3 draw against Leeds Utd. Ndlovu was a key component throughout the season in Gould\'s fast pacey front line which included John Williams, Kevin Gallacher (until his departure to Blackburn) and Robert Rosario, who formed a worthy partnership with Micky Quinn. Peter Ndlovu\'s goal against Norwich City, in a 1-1 draw in late September, was a signature piece of Ndlovu flare which earned him the Match of Day \'Goal of the month\' competition.[1]\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            The 1993/94 season would see a managerial shift in the autumn as Phil Neal, Bobby Gould\'s No.2, took over the reins from his passionate Coventry born boss but not before the legendary curtain raiser to the 93-94 season. Bobby Gould\'s first day gamble would be to play without traditional full backs. This novel formation gave Peter Ndlovu full licence to play a large part in a memorable opening day triumph in the capital. The 3-0 victory on a sunny 14 August, against double-cup winners Arsenal, saw Micky Quinn score a hat-trick in front of the newly refurbished North Bank. It also ensured that the Sky Blues made one of their customary lightning starts to the season, so synonymous of the early 1990s. After an early Ian Wright threat on the Coventry goal, it was Ndlovu who made a darting run into the Arsenal penalty box which produced a clumsy challenge from Lee Dixon. The resulting penalty was calmly converted by Micky Quinn for the opener. The second half would see Ndlovu and Roy Wegerle lead the Gunners defence a merry dance-Wegerle in particular enjoying possibly his finest game for the club. So shocked were Arsenal by the 3-0 defeat that manager George Graham cancelled the proposed post-match lap of honour at the final whistle, which was to parade their Coca Cola and FA Cup silverware. The explanation given by Arsenal was \'Reasons beyond the club\'s control!\'. It is thought the Sky Blues turned down a then-massive \xc2\xa34 million offer from Arsenal at the end of the same 1994 season for Ndlovu\'s services. The dramatic resignation of Bobby Gould, after a 5-1 mauling at Loftus Road in October 1993, was reputedly inspired by the possible imminent sale of Ndlovu to a top six club. However, Ndlovu stayed but the 11th place finish secured that season was not repeated in the 94-95 campaign. Phil Neal was replaced by Ron Atkinson. Big Ron saved the club from relegation in the spring of 1995 whilst also bringing in Gordon Strachan as his player-coach No.2.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/Swmf2SW5YwI/AAAAAAAAAG4/v8eUTOqgweQ/s1600/peter++ndlovu.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" shape="rect">\n                              <img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O1qgT8LFVYI/Swmf2SW5YwI/AAAAAAAAAG4/v8eUTOqgweQ/s400/peter++ndlovu.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 180px;" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5407028582624617218"></img>\n                            </a>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            This second significant phase for Ndlovu would once again promise much; the \'new era\' of big money signings heralded by Atkinson\'s appointment saw the arrival of Huckerby, Whelan, Salako and McAllister together with earlier signing Dion Dublin. Big Ron provided vital impetus in the spring of 95, but the following season his stylish and classy team sheet rarely \'clicked\' in the traditional sense. However, Ndlovu scored some memorable goals for the Sky Blues during this period, including the first away player to secure a hatrick at Anfield for 30 years. Other memorable goals in Sky Blue included a vital winning goal away at Wimbledon in a relegation six-pointer and a dynamic last minute rifling winner in a 3rd Round FA Cup tie at West Bromwich Albion.\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            <br clear="none"></br>\n                            Ndlovu gradually suffered due to inconsistency. The large and expansive side Gordon Strachan inherited, well equipped with attacking options, saw fierce competition for places from the likes of Whelan, Huckerby, Salako and Telfer. An increasingly cosmopolitan Premier league too would eventually see Coventry turn to the likes of Steve Froggatt and Moroccan internationals Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo in the years following Ndlovu\'s departure. However, if a \'Best Of\' goals compilation were ever undertaken by Coventry City, focusing on their top flight era, then Peter Ndlovu\'s name would figure prominently. He was known as \'Nuddy\' by the die hard Coventry City fans in Highfield Road\'s \'West End\' and as \'The \'Bulawayo Bullet\' by the media of the day. A likeable and mischievous character off the pitch, Peter Ndlovu is well placed in the top flight Coventry City goalscorers table with a return of 41 goals. The \'Gould-Neal\' and \'Atkinson-Strachan\' tenures in the Premiership remain some of Coventry City\'s most exciting-and indeed frustrating-spells in top flight football.\n
