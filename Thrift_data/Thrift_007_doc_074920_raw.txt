2008-05-06 20:12:19

Ok, I'm glad I did the Tuesday Night Bike Workout with my tri club. The intervals improved my
attitude and I did better than I did last week. I made it through all except the last two before
losing gas, and the guys/gals said this was by far the fastest workout of the season.

I still hate being mildly bi-polar. Feeling the way I do sometimes really sucks. Some things
just simply can't be papered over and forgiven... ever.

Chill out at 148 degrees

Lounging at Grover Hot Springs

Photo by Pete Dronkers

Deep in an alpine valley near South Lake Tahoe rests the secluded Grover Hot Springs, a place
rich with history and natural beauty. For nearly a century and a half, bathers have soaked in
the soothing mineral water and have immersed themselves in the awesome views of the
neighboring 10,000-foot peaks while doing so.

Grover Hot Springs State Park lies 70 miles south of Reno near the mountain town of
Markleeville, Calif. The first white settler in the valley arrived in 1854 to build a cattle
ranch and 10 years later his 12-foot pool began attracting travelers and ranchers.

"It was basically a mud hole with a plug at the bottom," said Supervising Ranger Gary Howard,
"You'd have to dive down and pull the plug to drain the pool."

By 1874, Alvin Grover was running a dairy business in the valley now called Hot Springs Valley.
He built a bathhouse, fenced in the pool and things were booming. Go there today and it's hard to
believe that there were once a hotel and several cabins next to the pool.

Today the entire valley, or about 700 acres, is owned by the California State Park System. It
was acquired at the request of its most recent owner by the state in 1960.

The water, running from a hillside 100 feet from the pool, surfaces at 148 degrees Fahrenheit.
Today it is collected and sent, virtually untreated, directly into a concrete pool and is
diluted with cold water to keep the temperature between 102 and 104 degrees.

"The lack of sulphur makes Grover very popular," said Howard. "Though it's not harmful in the
amounts found in hot springs, most people just don't like the smell of it."

A heat exchanger uses extra hot water to heat a larger swimming pool year-round to about 70
degrees. Unlike the small pool, the swimming pool is treated with chemicals and isn't drained
daily.

Open year-round, Grover Hot Springs is a haven for the outdoor enthusiast seeking
relaxation.

"For the most part, people that come to the park come for the hot springs," said Howard, "but
they're usually in the area for some other type of recreation. Our winter hours cater to the
skiers who come after a day on the slopes or on the trails."

Howard estimates that 60,000 people visit Grover Hot Springs each year, and 50,000 of them
camp in the park's facilities.

Just the facts



Directions : To get to the park from Reno, drive south on U.S Highway 395, through Carson City
toward Minden. Veer right at the junction of highways 395 and 88, toward Woodfords. At
Woodfords (about 10 miles from junction ), drive south on Highway 89 toward Markleeville. Six
miles later you'll be in Markleeville, from which signs will guide you west onto the Grover Hot
Springs access road. It is 3 miles west of Markleeville.

Hours : Summer hours are from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m daily. Winter hours are 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays,
closed Wednesday, and from noon to 9 p.m. on weekends. Call for for specific dates, as they vary
from year to year.

Cost : Entrance fees for the hot springs are $2 for adults and $1 for children under 16.

Facilities : The park offers much more than hot springs. It has 76 camp sites with showers,
picnic tables, grills and bear-proof lockers. The sites are open from late April to
mid-October, with reservations strongly advised from mid-May to the first week of September
(see www.parks.ca.gov or (800 ) 444-PARK ). Winter camping also is available from
mid-October to late April. The fee for camping is $12 per night.

Activities : Hiking and fishing are available during the summer, but winter hikes also can be
enjoyed in times of low snow. An 8-mile, round-trip, 2,000-foot hike starts at the hot springs
and ends at Burnside Lake, high in the valley. The Sierra District of the California State Park
System conducts guided activities year-round in many of the other parks. For information
call (530 ) 694-2248.

Information : The park office phone number is (530 ) 694-2248 and the pool office (530 )
694-2249. E-mail will be answered at grover@gbis.com

Remember : Swimsuits are required in the hot springs and are provided if you've forgotten
yours. Capacity is 75.

This is not a 'poor me' post, I'm actually in quite a good mood.

It just this simple - I can get somewhat better, but its going to take a ton of work and I'll still
never be very competitive or fast, and I can 'look good' without killing myself to get ready for
these races. I simply want to ride my bike and not feel pressured to go out and run all the time, or
feel like 'one of these days I have to get into the pool'.

I've raced less and less starting with 2006 being the most (although most of those were 5Ks and I
could easily just ride and do nothing but 5Ks ). But what's the point of staying active on a tri
site if you're not interested in doing what it takes to do them well? For what some of these races
cost, these are a lot of nice weekends relaxing at the beach or at a hotel.

Plus, I really feel like I'm neglecting my guitar and my writing.

I was walking past the mental hospital the other day and all the patients were shouting,
"13....13....13!!!!"



The fence was too high to see over but I saw a little gap in the planks, so I looked through it to see
what was going on.



Some moron poked me in the eye with a stick!

Then they all started shouting "14....14....14!!!!"

Iron Man rawked. Big time. Stay until the end of the credits, there's a nice Easter Egg at the
end.







2008-05-05 17:30:30

I really am The World's Biggest Slut. I mean, I'm getting picked up from work - after she picks up
a Costco hot dog for dinner - and then we're going to see Iron Man... and then I'll basically get a
ride back to where my car is parked. My life is GOOD.

I so want one after seeing Little Miss Sunshine on DVD this weekend. And you can keep a dead body
in back, and popstart it too (I did that with my Audi Super 90 when it died (dead battery ) once
)...

(in fact, she says she likes movies with "lots of killing" )

Should I drink a Psychotropic Cocktail first?

(I should remember my Dad reads this blog regularly. Then again, he's known how wacked I've
been for years ).





2008-05-05 15:40:22

2 things:

1 ) The first is the new Blog title, taken directly from what was shouted at my mini peloton by a
high maintenance woman - er bitch - who was all pissed a bunch of cyclists were riding on
California 160 (with cop escort no less ) and impeding her speedy progress to Something Really
Important.

2 ) The second is Rob Balducci, who simply kicks ass. If you don't agree, well BITE ME.

Here's the Race Report from Saturday



2008-05-05 09:57:59 The entire ALBUM from the Delta Three Bridges Ride is here. But here's
(most of it ) with sarcastic comments from Yours Truly:



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67055

The Blonde signs us in. See the girl in the nasty Ugg boots? She and a friend rode their cruisers
dressed like that and did not finish a FLAT, 15 mile piece of cake ride.



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67069

The Blonde's co-worker Susan. She has the most gnarly white Peugeot 12 speed from college. She
keep trying to kick my ass, too, sneaking up on a sprint try. Kicked her ass both times (she
really tried the 2nd time - if she had a more modern bike with clips, she'd be a monster ).



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67056

The cycling triumvirate that chased me most of the way (well, after I did my initial hammer and
passed the CHP lead car and then turned around and rode with 'em, because I was hauling ass for
about 20 minutes ). The Blonde on the left, Cindy (in gray sweats in the middle ) and Susan on the
right.



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67060

The Blonde had her first clipless fall before the ride started, trying to stop and forgetting
she was clipped in. I *told* her she'd fall sooner or later. Everyone does.



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67062

The ride is DONE! Cindy's borrowed mountain bike didn't have a water bottle holder, but as you
can um, see, she improvised.



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67064

I kept hearing 'em back there saying "let's go kick his ass" and they tried. Really hard. But I
held 'em off in the little ring LOL



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67065

The most fly jersey (in a rather small ) peloton, of course.



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67066

The Blonde and I. We WON in the raffle! A night + two Prime Rib Dinners at the Lakeside Inn at South
Lake Tahoe!



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67067

EYEBALLS! (The girls work for UC-Davis' Opthalmology Clinic )



Image: ../photos/get-photo.asp?photoid=67068

The clipless fall bruise on The Blonde's ass actually looks worse at a distance than it does
close up, but she says she's really *sore* this morning (Monday )







2008-05-05 09:19:33

Working on the "RR" for the Delta ride. Wasn't really a race, of course, although I did get
chased on 3 separate ocassions by 40something chicks. It was hot.

Image: ../tinymce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif

I have pics, but I don't know when I'll get them up. I'm using one of our DSL-enabled computers at
work, because some tool crashed the main router for the entire agency over the weekend while
doing 'server maintenance.'

And while you slackers sleep, she's probably training hard enough to kick your ass from here to
January:

(its probably sucking even worse, now, isn't it? Well, it could be worse. You could be a guy
riding crits in Missouri and getting beat by people who look like they need a sandwich and
intensive acne meds. Or you could be me. Even not being in a race, that sucks a lot as it is. )

Oh, now that the warm weather is back, Notre Dame is back riding the bike trail with his mountain
bike, wind chimes, IMPRESSIVE tan, and iPod, along with the weird gestures and a smile that
looks like a leftover of too many psychotropic cocktails while in lock-down treatment. But he
always waves.

I'm wondering if Van Gogh is around this year, or if he's in lockdown getting a psychotropic
cocktail right now...

I got the most interesting email today - from a civilian recruiter for the NAVY!

They'd found my resume on USAJOBS and were inviting me to consider applying for a Community
Planner job at the Great Lakes facility north of Chicago.

Now, there's NFW I'd live there - cold, expensive. BUT - the Navy has openings in San Diego. I'd
move there in a heartbeat.

I guess watching "Carrier" must be putting some good karma my way.

This could be a very good career change as I'm feeling stale in my agency. I'd get to keep my
benefits and retirement package, I'd just be moving to a different part of the federal gov't.







2008-05-01 11:08:32

This guy is pretty funny... below is an except from his blog:

Are Triathletes Cyclists?



This is one of those deeply profound questions, like “What is the sound of one hand
clapping?” or “Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?” Yes, triathletes ride bikes,
but they also swim and run and are generally weird. Well, in light of my definition of
“cyclist” I think I have an answer. A triathlete is a cyclist provided he or she would still
ride even if the cycling portion of triathlons was officially replaced with some other
activity, such as rollerblading or curling while on mescaline. If in such a situation the
triathlete says, “Hey, that sucks! Well forget triathlons, I’m going to keep riding,”
then he or she is a cyclist. But if the triathlete immediately puts all his or her bike stuff on
Craigslist and buys a big heavy rock, a broom, and some peyote, then he or she is just some freak
in a half-shirt.







2008-05-01 10:43:26

In the Constant Re-evaluation of goals that I run through in my head...

I think I'm going to shoot for running 700-800 miles this year, and improve the quality of those
miles. Last year, I ran a ton to finish the marathon, and while it did give me a nice base I'm
simply not willing to do the focusing I think would be necessary to really have a better
marathon performance this year. I finished one, I can 'check that off the list of life goals' so
to speak - for now.

What I found out running so much last year is I can be a decent runner, but I really felt like my
cycling suffered with the high mileage. I also gained more weight running - part of it was due to
nutrition issues, but my body likes cycling better for keeping weight off. And while I dug all
the races I did, I kind of miss doing a lot of 5K races. They were fun, I didn't have to put in killer
weeks run mileage wise to do them and I still could put in lots of cycling time. California is
cycling paradise, especially now that we've gone into the dry season and it will be sunny and
dry through November now.



I'll run the SF half for fun, and see if I can improve my time for the Buffalo Stampede 10 mile and
set a PR at Cowtown in October. But I'd like to put in decent performances at the TBF duathlons in
June and July, so, after this weekend's charity bike ride, its ride lots and put in 3-4 days of
running per week... perhaps a 5 5 10 3 type schedule. I have two Regular Days off in May and if the
weather is favorable I'm going to do the solo century and knock that off of my long-term goals.

I didn't know the Navy hired Community Planners, but I just got a solicitation from some Navy
planning center that's north of Chicago that had found my resume in an online search of our
federal job hunting system. Hmmm... might be fun to live there, until about October 1 when the
whole area starts to freeze solid at night.

Actually this is my FAVORITE PART of the Wikipedia entry. So you can BITE me LOL:

Sacramento has a Mediterranean climate that is characterized by mild winters and dry, hot
summers ( Koppen climate classification Csa ). The area usually has low humidity. Rain
typically falls only between November and March, with the rainy season tapering off almost
completely by the end of April. The average temperature throughout the year is 61 Â°F (16
Â°C ), with the daily average ranging from 46 Â°F (8 Â°C ) in December and January to 76
Â°F (24 Â°C ). Average daily high temperatures range from 53 Â°F (12 Â°C ) in December
and January to 93 Â°F (34 Â°C ) in July (with many days of over 100 Â°F (38 Â°C ) highs ).
Daily low temperatures range from 38 to 58 Â°F (3 to 14 Â°C ).

Sacramento riverfront (as seen from the The Ziggurat )

The average year has 73 days with a high over 90 Â°F (32 Â°C ), with the highest temperature
on record being 115 Â°F (46 Â°C ) on July 25 , 2006 , and 18 days when the low drops below 32
Â°F (0 Â°C ), with the coldest day on record being December 11 , 1932 , at 17 Â°F (-8 Â°C ).

Average yearly precipitation is 17.4" (442 mm ), with almost no rain during the summer months,
to an average rainfall of 3.7" (94 mm ) in January. It rains, on average, 58 days of the year. In
February 1992, Sacramento had 16 consecutive days of rain (6.41" or 163 mm ). A record 7.24"
(184 mm ) of rain fell on April 20 , 1880 .

On average, 96 days in the year have fog, mostly in the morning ( tule fog ), primarily in
December and January. The fog can get extremely dense, lowering visibility to less than 100
feet (30 m ) and making driving conditions hazardous.

The record snowfall was recorded on January 4 , 1888 , at 9 cm (3.5 in ). Snowfall is rare in
Sacramento (with an elevation of only 52 feet or 16 m above sea level ), with a dusting of snow
every eight to ten years. Forty miles (65 km ) east of Sacramento, in the foothills, snow
accumulation is an annual occurrence. Further east, the Lake Tahoe recreation area is home to
a number of world famous ski areas which have accumulation greater than 90" (230 cm ) nearly
every year during the peak season. Spots in the Sierra Nevada mountains east of Sacramento
annually receive some of the greatest snowfall in the lower 48 states, and the mountain
range's immense snowpack is a vital source of water for the entire state of California.

Sacramento is the capital of the U.S. state of California and the county seat of Sacramento
County . Located along the Sacramento River and just south of the American River's confluence
in California's expansive Central Valley , it is the seventh most populous city in California
with a 2007 estimated population of 467,343. [1] Sacramento is the core cultural and economic
center of its four-county metropolitan area ( El Dorado , Placer , Sacramento , and Yolo
counties ) with a combined population of 2,103,956. The Sacramento Metropolitan Area is the
largest in the Central Valley, and is the fourth-largest in California, behind the Greater
Los Angeles Area , the San Francisco Bay Area , and the San Diego area. Greater Sacramento has
been cited as one of the five "most livable" regions in America, [2] and the city was cited by
Time magazine as America's most integrated. [3]

Sacramento became a city due to the efforts of John Sutter , a Swiss immigrant, and James W.
Marshall . Sacramento grew faster due to the protection of Sutter's Fort , which was
established by Sutter in 1839. During the California Gold Rush , Sacramento was a major
distribution point, a commercial and agricultural center, and a terminus for wagon trains ,
stagecoaches , riverboats , the telegraph , the Pony Express , and the First Transcontinental
Railroad .

Sacramento is referred to by nicknames such as Sac , SacTown , Sacto , River City , and The
Capitol .

California State University, Sacramento , more commonly known as Sacramento State or Sac
State , is the major local university. It is one of the twenty-three campuses of the California
State University system. In addition, the University of California, Davis is located in
nearby Davis , just west of the capitol.

[ edit ] History

Main article: History of Sacramento, California



[ edit ] Indigenous culture



Nisenan (Southern Maidu ) and Plains Miwok Indians have lived in this area for perhaps
thousands of years. Unlike the settlers who would eventually make Sacramento their home,
these Indians left little evidence of their existence. Traditionally, their diet was
dominated by acorns taken from the plentiful oak trees in the region, and by fruits, bulbs,
seeds, and roots gathered throughout the year.

In either 1799 or 1808, the Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga "discovered" and named the
Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento River after the Spanish term for 'sacrament',
specifically, after "the Most Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ", referring to
the Roman Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist .



[ edit ] From pioneers to gold fever

Sacramento in 1849.

The pioneer John Sutter arrived from Liestal , Switzerland in the Sacramento area with other
settlers in August 1839 and established the trading colony and stockade Sutter's Fort (as New
Helvetia or "New Switzerland" ) in 1840. Sutter's Fort was constructed using labor from local
Native American tribes. Sutter received 2,000 fruit trees in 1847, which started the
agriculture industry in the Sacramento Valley. In 1848, when gold was discovered by James W.
Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma (located some 50 miles, or 80 kilometers, northeast of the
fort ), a large number of gold-seekers came to the area, increasing the population. John
Sutter, Jr. then planned the City of Sacramento, in association with Sam Brannan against the
wishes of his father, naming the city after the Sacramento River for commercial reasons. He
hired topographical engineer William H. Warner to draft the official layout of the city,
which included 26 lettered and 31 numbered streets (today's grid from C St. to Broadway and
from Front St. to Alhambra Blvd. ). However, a bitterness grew between the elder Sutter and his
son as Sacramento became an overnight commercial success (Sutter's Fort, Mill and the town of
Sutterville, all founded by John Sutter, Sr., would eventually fail ).

The part of Sacramento originally laid out by William Warner is situated just east and south of
where the American River meets the Sacramento River (though over time it has grown to extend
significantly north, south, and east of there ). A number of directly adjacent towns, cities
or unincorporated county suburbs, such as Fair Oaks , Carmichael , Citrus Heights , Elk Grove ,
Folsom , Rancho Cordova , Roseville , Rocklin , West Sacramento , Orangevale , and North
Highlands extend the greater Sacramento area.

The citizens of Sacramento adopted a city charter in 1849, which was recognized by the state
legislature in 1850. Sacramento is the oldest incorporated city in California,
incorporated on February 27 , 1850 . [4] During the early 1850s the Sacramento valley was
devastated by floods, fires and cholera epidemics. Despite this, because of its position
just downstream from the Mother Lode in the Sierra Nevada , the newly founded city grew,
quickly reaching a population of 10,000.

California's State Capitol Building

The California State Legislature , with the support of Governor John Bigler , moved to
Sacramento in 1854. The Capital of California before 1846 was located in Monterey where in
1849 the first Constitutional Convention and state elections were held. In 1849 the State
Legislature voted to sit the State Capitol in San Jose . After 1850, when California was
ratified as a state, the Capitol was also located in Vallejo , and Benicia before moving to
Sacramento. In the 1879 Constitutional Convention, Sacramento was named to be the permanent
State Capital.

Begun in 1860 to be reminiscent of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC , the Classical
Revival style California State Capitol was completed in 1874. In 1861, the legislative
session was moved to the Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco for one session due to
massive flooding in Sacramento. The legislative chambers were first occupied in 1869 while
construction continued. From 1862-1868, part of the Leland Stanford Mansion was used for the
governor's offices during Stanford's tenure as the Governor; and the legislature met in the
Sacramento County Courthouse.

With its new status and strategic location, Sacramento quickly prospered and became the
western end of the Pony Express , and later the First Transcontinental Railroad (which began
construction in Sacramento in 1863 and was financed by " The Big Four " â€“ Mark Hopkins ,
Charles Crocker , Collis P. Huntington , and Leland Stanford ) Leland Stanford is known as the
man who hammered in the last (golden ) spike into the transcontinental railroad and also, the
man who founded Stanford University in honor of his fifteen-year old son, who had died.

Bridge , built in 1935, a popular landmark.

In 1850 and again in 1861, Sacramentans were faced with a completely flooded town. After the
devastating 1850 flood, Sacramento experienced a cholera epidemic and a flu epidemic, which
crippled the town for several years. In 1861, the legend has it that Governor Leland Stanford,
who was inaugurated in early January 1861, had to attend his inauguration in a rowboat, which
was not too far from his house in town on N street. The flood waters were so bad, the legend says,
that when he returned to his house, he had to enter into it through the second floor window. In
1862 Sacramento raised the level of the city by landfill. Thus the previous first floors of
buildings became the basements , which were later connected by tunnels under the streets of
Old Sacramento. The tunnels became a network of opium dens, which were also mostly filled in.
However, it is still possible to view portions of the " Sacramento Underground ."

The same rivers that earlier brought death and destruction began to provide increasing
levels of transportation and commerce. Both the American and especially Sacramento rivers
would be key elements in the economic success of the city. In fact, Sacramento effectively
controlled commerce on these rivers, and public works projects were funded though taxes
levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic Sacramento Rail
Yards.

Now both rivers are used extensively for recreation . The American River is a 5-mph (8-km/h )
waterway for all power boats (including jet-ski and similar craft ) (Source Sacramento
County Parks & Recreation ) and has become an international attraction for rafters and
kayakers. The Sacramento River sees many boaters, who can make day trips to nearby sloughs or
continue along the Delta to the Bay Area and San Francisco . The Delta King , a paddlewheel
steamboat which for eighteen months lay on the bottom of the San Francisco Bay, was
refurbished and now boasts a hotel, a restaurant, and two different theatres for nightlife
along the Old Sacramento riverfront.



[ edit ] The modern era



The city's current charter was adopted by voters in 1920, establishing a city
council-and-manager form of government, still used today. As a charter city , Sacramento is
exempt from many laws and regulations passed by the state legislature . The city has expanded
continuously over the years. The 1964 merger of the City of North Sacramento with Sacramento
substantially increased its population, and large annexations of the Natomas area
eventually led to significant population growth throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

Sacramento City and County (along with a portion of adjacent Placer County ) are served by a
customer-owned electric utility, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD ).
Sacramento voters approved the creation of SMUD in 1923. In April, 1946, after 12 years of
litigation, a judge ordered Pacific Gas & Electric to transfer title of Sacramento's
electric distribution system to SMUD. SMUD today is the sixth-largest public electric
utility in the U.S., and has a worldwide reputation for innovative programs and services,
including the development of clean fuel resources, such as solar power .

The Sacramento-Yolo Port District was created in 1947, and ground was broken on the Port of
Sacramento in 1949. On June 29 , 1963 , with 5,000 spectators waiting to welcome her, the Motor
Vessel Taipei Victory arrived. [5] The port was open for business. The Nationalist Chinese
flag ship, freshly painted for the historic event, was loaded with 5,000 tons of bagged rice
for Mitsui Trading Co. bound for Okinawa and 1,000 tons of logs for Japan . She was the first
ocean-going vessel in Sacramento since the steamship Harpoon in 1934. The Port of Sacramento
has been plagued with operating losses in recent years and faces bankruptcy. This severe loss
in business is due to the heavy competition from the Port of Stockton , which has a larger
facility and a deeper channel. As of 2006, the city of West Sacramento took responsibility for
the Port of Sacramento. During the Viet Nam era, the Port of Sacramento was the major terminus
in the supply route for all military parts, hardware and other cargo going into Southeast
Asia.

In 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan became the last Governor of California to live permanently in
the city. A new executive mansion, constructed by private funds in a Sacramento suburb for
Reagan, remained vacant for nearly forty years and was recently sold by the state.

The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of several local military bases: McClellan Air Force Base ,
Mather Air Force Base , and Sacramento Army Depot. As a result, the U.S. armed forces have
little military presence in the city except for recruiting offices.

In the early 1990s, Mayor Joe Serna attempted to lure the Los Angeles Raiders football team to
Sacramento, selling $50 million in bonds as earnest money. When the deal fell through, the
bond proceeds were used to construct several large projects, including expanding the
Convention Center and refurbishing of the Memorial Auditorium. Serna renamed a city park for
controversial farm labor organizer Cesar Chavez . Through his effort, Sacramento became the
first major city in the country to have a paid municipal holiday honoring Chavez.

Tower will be completed Spring 2008

In spite of major military base closures and the decline of agricultural food processing,
Sacramento continued to experience massive population growth in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Primary sources of population growth are people migrating from the San Francisco Bay Area
seeking lower housing costs, as well as immigration from Asia, Central America , Mexico ,
Ukraine , and the rest of the former Soviet Union . From 1990 to 2000, the population grew 14.7%.
The Census Bureau estimates that in four years (2000-2004 ), the population of Sacramento
County increased from 1,223,499 to 1,352,445.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Mayor Heather Fargo made several abortive attempts to
provide taxpayer financing of a new sports arena for the Maloof brothers, owners of the
Sacramento Kings NBA Basketball franchise. In November 2006, Sacramento voters soundly
defeated a proposed sales tax hike to finance this, due in part to competing plans for the new
arena and its location.

Despite a devolution of state government in recent years, the state of California remains by
far Sacramento's largest employer. The City of Sacramento expends considerable effort to
keep state agencies from moving outside the city limits. In addition, many federal agencies
have offices in Sacramento.

The California Supreme Court normally sits in San Francisco .

Sacramento River near the old pumping station

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 99.2 square miles
(257.0 kmÂ² ), of which, 97.2 square miles (251.6 kmÂ² ) of it is land and 2.1 square miles
(5.4 kmÂ² ) of it is water; 2.1% of the area is water. The population in 2000 was 407,018; the
1980 population was 275,741. The city's current estimated population is approximately
454,330. Depth to groundwater is typically about 30 feet (9 m ). Much of the land to the west of
the city (in Yolo County ) is a flood control basin. As a result, the greater metropolitan area
sprawls only four miles (6 km ) west of downtown (as West Sacramento, California ) but 30 miles
(50 km ) northeast and east, into the Sierra Nevada foothills , and 10 miles (16 km ) to the south
into valley farmland .

The city is located at the confluence of the Sacramento River and the American River , and has a
deepwater port connected to the San Francisco Bay by a channel through the Sacramento River
Delta . It is the shipping and rail center for the Sacramento Valley , fruit , vegetables , rice ,
wheat , dairy goods, and beef . Food processing is among the major industries in the area.



[ edit ] Climate



Sacramento has a Mediterranean climate that is characterized by mild winters and dry, hot
summers ( Koppen climate classification Csa ). The area usually has low humidity. Rain
typically falls only between November and March, with the rainy season tapering off almost
completely by the end of April. The average temperature throughout the year is 61 Â°F (16
Â°C ), with the daily average ranging from 46 Â°F (8 Â°C ) in December and January to 76
Â°F (24 Â°C ). Average daily high temperatures range from 53 Â°F (12 Â°C ) in December
and January to 93 Â°F (34 Â°C ) in July (with many days of over 100 Â°F (38 Â°C ) highs ).
Daily low temperatures range from 38 to 58 Â°F (3 to 14 Â°C ).

Sacramento riverfront (as seen from the The Ziggurat )

The average year has 73 days with a high over 90 Â°F (32 Â°C ), with the highest temperature
on record being 115 Â°F (46 Â°C ) on July 25 , 2006 , and 18 days when the low drops below 32
Â°F (0 Â°C ), with the coldest day on record being December 11 , 1932 , at 17 Â°F (-8 Â°C ).

Average yearly precipitation is 17.4" (442 mm ), with almost no rain during the summer months,
to an average rainfall of 3.7" (94 mm ) in January. It rains, on average, 58 days of the year. In
February 1992, Sacramento had 16 consecutive days of rain (6.41" or 163 mm ). A record 7.24"
(184 mm ) of rain fell on April 20 , 1880 .

On average, 96 days in the year have fog, mostly in the morning ( tule fog ), primarily in
December and January. The fog can get extremely dense, lowering visibility to less than 100
feet (30 m ) and making driving conditions hazardous.

The record snowfall was recorded on January 4 , 1888 , at 9 cm (3.5 in ). Snowfall is rare in
Sacramento (with an elevation of only 52 feet or 16 m above sea level ), with a dusting of snow
every eight to ten years. Forty miles (65 km ) east of Sacramento, in the foothills, snow
accumulation is an annual occurrence. Further east, the Lake Tahoe recreation area is home to
a number of world famous ski areas which have accumulation greater than 90" (230 cm ) nearly
every year during the peak season. Spots in the Sierra Nevada mountains east of Sacramento
annually receive some of the greatest snowfall in the lower 48 states, and the mountain
range's immense snowpack is a vital source of water for the entire state of California.

[ edit ] Unincorporated Neighborhoods





[ edit ] Antelope



Antelope is an unincorporated area located approximately 15 miles (24 km ) northeast of
downtown Sacramento. Established in the mid-1800s by Chinese immigrants who worked for the
railroad, Antelope began as, and remains, a bedroom community . By 1973, Antelope still
consisted of little more than a general store and a half-dozen homes. As the surrounding areas
grew in the 1980s and 1990s, so did Antelope. By 1993 the residents of the area voted to be
recognized as a community by the county and with their own ZIP code (95843 ) which became
effective July 1 , 1994 . By the 2000 Census the population had grown to more than 36,000.



[ edit ] Arden-Arcade



Arden Arcade is a community immediately east of the city of Sacramento and north of the
American River that includes an affluent area called Arden Park. Its population was once
listed at over 90,000 people and boasted 42,987 households. However, after the census of
2000, the borders of the community were changed and the population was listed at a revised
total of 83,000. It is located only minutes from downtown and offers many shopping and
entertainment venues. There are over 2,000 businesses in the area, employing over 40,000
people. Access to outdoor recreation is also nearby because Arden is bordered by the American
River Parkway, a 26-mile (42-kilometer ) hike and bike trail that follows the American River
to Folsom Lake. Golf, swimming and city parks are also close by. There is an organized group of
citizens looking to place an incorporation measure on the ballot in 2008. There is also an
effort by the city of Sacramento to annex Arden-Arcade. This is the first effort since 1960.
Unlike CDP's like Carmichael and Fair Oaks, People living in Arden-Arcade have a Sacramento
address.



[ edit ] Carmichael



Carmichael is located 10 miles (16 km ) northeast of downtown Sacramento and is a historic
community that dates back to the early 1900s. It was founded by Dan Carmichael, who was mayor of
Sacramento in 1917-1919. Some of the remaining signs of the early Carmichael days are the palm
trees along Palm Drive, planted around 1913. The current population is 49,742; there are
20,631 total households, 64% are family households, and the median age is 40. Carmichael is
home to the beautiful Ancil Hoffman Park which houses the 77 acre Effie Yeaw Nature Center, a
sprawling pristine nature preserve along the banks of the American River. Golf can also be
played in the park under the shade of native oaks trees.



[ edit ] Fair Oaks



Fair Oaks, located 15 miles (24 km ) east of downtown Sacramento and, with a population of
28,808, is an affluent, well-established community. It consists of suburban and semi-rural
neighborhoods. The area is home to rolling hills and numerous native oaks that add to the
area's quality of life. The views of the American River bluffs and nearby Nimbus Hatchery and
Folsom Dam add to the distinctive character of Fair Oaks.

Fair Oaksâ€™ uniqueness also stems from its existing business core and town center,
known as the Fair Oaks Village. The village is home to narrow winding roads, rolling hills, an
open-air amphitheatre, and a historic plaza of historic buildings full of unique galleries
and shops. The Village has a charming small town atmosphere. The Plaza Park Amphitheatre,
located in the Village, is the main site of the Fair Oaks Theatre Festival, one of the many
outdoor community theatres in the area. Fair Oaks Village is also the site of the annual Fiesta
Days, an event celebrating the residents of Fair Oaks.



[ edit ] Gold River



Gold River is an affluent suburb 15 miles (24 km ) east of downtown Sacramento that is often
mistakenly considered part of Rancho Cordova , an incorporated city in Sacramento County,
California. The population was 8,023 at the 2000 census. The Gold River Community
Association is the master association for the 25 separate "villages" that make up the
community. Each village has its own sub associations as well.



[ edit ] La Riviera



La Riviera is a suburban community, 10 miles (16 km ) east of downtown Sacramento. The
population was 10,273 at the 2000 census. La Riviera is a primarily residential neighborhood
located between the American River and Highway 50. It's popular place to live for college
students attending California State University Sacramento, or CSUS. The community is
sub-divided by La Riviera Drive into the areas of College Greens and Glenbrook.



[ edit ] Orangevale



Orangevale is a semi-rural suburb in the northeastern area of the county (north of Fair Oaks,
east of Citrus Heights, west of Folsom and south of the Placer County city of Roseville and
community of Granite Bay ). The population was 26,705 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated
community is known for its abundance of horses.



[ edit ] Rio Linda/Elverta



Rio Linda, Spanish for "Beautiful River", is a community located north of Sacramento city and
is home to over 10,000 people. There are approximately 3,500 households, 77% of which are
family households and the median age is 34. This rural working-class community offers an
escape from the busy city life. Rio Linda/Elverta has its roots as a small farming community
established in the early 1900s. The Gibson Ranch and Cherry Island Golf Course are a couple of
the places this area offers for horseback riding and outdoor recreation. There is currently a
campaign to incorporate the Rio Linda and Elverta communities to form a single township which
would then be governed independently from surrounding areas.



[ edit ] North Highlands



North Highlands is a community of 44,000 residents that is located approximately 10 miles (16
km ) northeast of downtown Sacramento. The community was formally established with the
opening of the North Highlands post office in July 1952 and this unincorporated area grew with
the development of the McClellan Air Force Base. North Highlands is mostly a middle-class
residential housing area. With some commercial and industrial regions around the McClellan
Air Force Base, now a civilian airport, called McClellan Business Park.



[ edit ] Vineyard



Vineyard is a new suburban neighborhood in Sacramento County approximately 15 miles (24 km )
southeast of downtown Sacramento. The population was 10,109 at the 2000 census, however,
plans have been announced to add as many as 20,000 new homes to Vineyard. This could add as many
as 60,000 new people to the area. Along with the houses would come new shopping centers, parks,
and schools. However, some have been critical of the expansion and one California State
University, Sacramento professor referred to it as "car-oriented sprawl development."
However, there are plans to extend some sort of public transportation to Vineyard and to build
around the train tracks that go through the town.

University , an evangelical Christian college.

The University of California has a campus, UC Davis , in nearby Davis and also has a graduate
center in downtown Sacramento. The UC Davis Graduate School of Management (GSM ) is located in
downtown Sacramento on One Capital Mall. Many students, about 400 out of 517, at the UC Davis
GSM are working professionals and are completing their MBA part-time. [14] The part-time
program is ranked in the top-20 and is well-known for its small class size, world class
faculty, and involvement in the business community. UC also maitains the University of
California Sacramento Center (UCCS for undergraduate and graduate studies. Similar to the
UC's Washington DC program, "Scholar Interns" engage in both academic studies and as well as
internships, often with the state government.

Also, the UC Davis School of Medicine is located at the UC Davis Medical Center in Oak Park.

[ edit ] Private schools



Shalom School is the only Jewish day school in Sacramento.

Continuing an educational history that began in the Sacramento region at the time of the Gold
Rush, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento operates 1 diocesan high school within the
city and surrounding suburbs, St. Francis High School . Various Roman Catholic religious
congregations operate four additional Catholic "private" (i.e., non-diocesan ) high
schools in the city and suburbs: Loretto High School (sponsored by the Institute of the
Blessed Virgin Mary ), Christian Brothers High School (sponsored by the Brothers of
Christian Schools ), Jesuit High School (the Society of Jesus, or "Jesuits" ), and, as of the
Fall of 2006, Cristo Rey High School Sacramento (co-sponsored by the Sisters of Notre Dame de
Namur, the Sisters of Mercy, and the Jesuits ). Sacramento is one of 12 cities in the United
States with a Cristo Rey Network High School, the first of which was founded by the Jesuits in
Chicago in 1996 on a reduced tuition model designed to be accessible to those otherwise unable
to afford conventionally-priced private education.

Additionally within the city and surrounding suburbs are 30 "parochial" schools â€“
i.e., schools attached to a parish. These range from the oldest still operating, St. Francis
of Assisi Elementary School (1895 ), to the newest, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton (2000 ), to the
recently consolidated, John Paul II School (2005 ), combining All Hallows (1948 ) and St.
Peter (1955 ) Schools at the All Hallows Parish site.

In 1857, almost immediately upon their arrival from Ireland, the Sisters of Mercy opened the
first school of any kind in Sacramento. Open to all regardless of religious denomination, St.
Joseph Academy continued operation through the late 1960s. The final school site is now a city
of Sacramento parking garage. The "St. Joseph Garage" honors the name of the school that
marked the arrival of formal education in Sacramento.

While Catholic institutions still dominate the independent school scene in the Sacramento
area, in 1964, Sacramento Country Day School opened and offered Sacramentans an independent
school that is affiliated with the California Association of Independent Schools. SCDS has
grown to its present day status as a learning community for students from pre-kindergarten
through twelfth grade.

There is one Islamic school in Sacramento, founded in 1998.

Reconstruction of California's first permanent theatre, the Eagle Theatre

The primary newspaper is The Sacramento Bee , founded in 1857 by James McClatchy . Its rival,
the Sacramento Union , started publishing six years earlier in 1851; it closed its doors in
1994. Writer and journalist Mark Twain wrote for the Union in 1866. In late 2004, a new
Sacramento Union returned with bimonthly magazines and in May 2005 began monthly
publication, but does not intend to return as a daily newspaper. In 2006, The McClatchy
Company purchased Knight Ridder Inc. to become the second-largest newspaper publisher in
the United States. The Sacramento Bee has won five Pulitzer Prizes in its history. It has won
numerous other awards, including many for its progressive public service campaigns
promoting free speech (the Bee often criticized government policy, and uncovered many
scandals hurting Californians ), anti-racism (the Bee supported the Union during the
American Civil War and publicly denounced the Ku Klux Klan ), worker's rights (the Bee has a
strong history of supporting unionization ), and environmental protection (leading
numerous tree-planting campaigns and fighting against environmental destruction in the
Sierra Nevada ). [16]

Four Building in Old Sacramento

The oldest part of the town besides Sutter's Fort is Old Sacramento , which consists of cobbled
streets and some historic buildings, some from the 1860s. Buildings have been preserved,
restored or reconstructed, and the district is now a substantial tourist attraction, with
rides on steam-hauled historic trains and paddle steamers .

The "Big Four Building", built in 1852, was home to the offices of Collis Huntington , Mark
Hopkins , Leland Stanford , and Charles Crocker . The Central Pacific Railroad and Southern
Pacific Railroad were founded there. The original building was destroyed in 1963 for the
construction of Interstate 5, but was re-created using original elements in 1965. It is now a
National Historic Landmark . Also of historic interest is the Eagle Theatre , a
reconstruction of California's first permanent theatre in its original location.

at the same time the pavilion was built. It is the smallest of the venues providing seating for
only 300. The Sacramento Ballet , Sacramento Philharmonic Orchestra and the Sacramento
Opera perform at the Community Center Theatre.

There are several Theatre companies with professional stature. California Musical Theatre
and its Summer stock theatre , Music Circus bring many directors and performers from New York
and the Los Angeles area to work and perform in their productions at the Wells Fargo Pavilion .
During the fall, winter and spring seasons Broadway Sacramento brings bus and truck tours to
the Convention Center Theatre. The Sacramento Theatre Company provides non-musical
productions of high quality as an Equity House Theatre, performing in the McClatchy Main
stage. At the [B Street Theatre], smaller and more intimate professional productions are
performed as well as a children's theatre. The Sacramento Shakespeare Festival provides
entertainment under the stars every summer in William Land Park.

California. Some of these include, the 24th Street Theatre, River City Theatre Company,
Runaway Stage Productions, Magic Circle Theatre, Big Idea Theatre, Celebration Arts,
Lambda Player, Synergy Stage and the historic Eagle Theatre. Many of these theatres compete
annually for the Elly Awards overseen by The Sacramento Area Regional Theatre Alliance or
SARTA.

On Wednesday June 13 , 2007 a new studio for the performing arts was announced to be built
alongside the Sacramento Theatre company and the Wells Fargo Pavilion. The new multi million
dollar complex will be named "The E. Claire Raley Studios for the Performing Arts" and will
provide rehearsal space for 4 of the regions principal arts groups, the Sacramento Ballet,
California Musical Theatre, Sacramento Opera and the Sacramento Philharmonic Orchestra,
centralizing most of the city's Arts organizations.

Sacramento has several major museums. The Crocker Art Museum , the oldest public art museum
west of the Mississippi River is one of the finest. On July 26 , 2007 the Museum broke ground for
an expansion that will more than triple the buildings floor space. The Modern architecture
will be much different from the Victorian style building it is added to. Construction is to be
completed by 2010.

Also of interest is the Governor's Mansion State Historic Park, a large Victorian Mansion
which was home to 13 of California's Governors. The Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic
Park, which was completely restored in 2006, serves as the State's official address for
diplomatic and business receptions. Guided public tours are available. The California
