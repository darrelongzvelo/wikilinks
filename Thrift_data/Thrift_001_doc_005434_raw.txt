Little dune buggy

Posted on June 2, 2012 by ahjw2012

We landed at the Fortaleza airport and again marvelled at South Americaâ€™s inability
to designate a taxi rank, meaning we stumbled around like idiots, back and forth across the
busy road, while prospective drivers fought among themselves for our business. The cab to our
hostel showed off the extreme security lengths that many homes and businesses go to, with what
looked like around 75% of all properties having a perimeter of barbed wire, razor wire, metal
spikes, broken glass or electric fences. I had high hopes for Fortaleza, but they were dashed
before too long, and I was quickly arriving at the opinion that Rio, Giselle and Havaianas were
the only good things to come out of Brazil.

We checked into the Rolling Stone Hostel, I wonâ€™t hyperlink it because you should
extinguish it from your memory, located one street back from the best swimming beach in
Fortaleza (mainly by default because the other beaches are too polluted) surrounded by
rotting properties and shady looking locals. When we arrived in the mid-afternoon, the staff
member on duty (who looked like one of the Williams sisters minus the ability to speak any
English) showed us to our room that appeared to be designed by the people who constructed the
supermax Barwon Prison â€“ there was a tiny bed, a bathroom that didnâ€™t have any
floor space (meaning you could sit on the toilet and have a shower simultaneously, if so
inclined), and a glass window opening to the main hallway with a light beaming through like the
sun preventing any guests from getting more than a wink of sleep per evening. To top it off,
there were no towels (they had to be rented at reception) or other basic toiletries like soap
that all our other hostels had provided.

I didnâ€™t mind so much, but poor Amy was offended at the false marketing from the owners
after having a clearly misleading website. She marched downstairs and promptly told the
Williams sister, mostly through the use of hand gestures, that we would be cancelling our
second night. We then walked along the main footpath to the office where you could purchase bus
tickets to Jericoacoara, which Amy arranged for the next bus out of there, leaving at 9am the
following morning. We walked back along the promenade overlooking the beach â€“ it was
basically just huge piles of sand, an ocean with no waves, and scattered palm trees. That might
sound okay, but it really lacked character.

We stopped for dinner at a beachfront restaurant where Amy made the startling affirmation
that â€œI think Iâ€™m getting too old for hostelsâ€�. Music to my ears, and I
assured her that I would look forward to taking a more active role in the planning of our future
holidays. On the spot (through the good people at Kayak ), we decided to book a hotel for a night
in Fortaleza that we had to have when we returned from Jericoacoara because of our flight
times. For AUD $50 more per night than the Rolling Stone Hostel, we could stay at a four star
beachfront hotel with free buffet breakfast and wifi, and it was also the hotel where the bus
would drop all the passengers returning from Jericoacoara.

We returned to the hostel where, fortunately, a European with good English was working so Amy
explained our situation and asked if we could finalise the bill since we were leaving early the
next day. After showers inferior to what English peasants in the 12 th century had, we each had a
restless sleep and woke up a little frazzled. We packed our bags and attempted to leave, but the
towering Williams sister had returned and I put my mediator hat on to prevent a war from
erupting between her and the equally fiery Amy. Our taxi turned up, but the Williams sister
wouldnâ€™t let us leave until weâ€™d paid another BRL $17 (or AUD $8.50); keep in
mind that by this stage we had already paid way above what we needed to, especially considering
the cancellation insurance Amy paid for when booking the hostel. Eventually we left and made
our way to Hotel Praiano where we paid AUD $15 in total for the two of us to partake in the
hotelâ€™s breakfast buffet.

We got money out from a nearby ATM (there are no ATMs in Jericoacoara) and boarded our luxurious
bus for the trip there. It wasnâ€™t quite an Argentinian first class bus, but they were
comfortable chairs with an almost full recline. Due to the low occupancy rate, we were able to
get a row (two seats) each and get a better glimpse of Fortaleza. After seeing all the crazy
fencing, graffiti and undesirable people lurking around, I began to think that the Gold Coast
has copped a bad rap for being a dangerous and sterile beachfront city. Fortaleza makes the
Gold Coast look like Utopia.

We were on the bus for four hours and then changed vehicles for an Aquaduck-looking thing
â€“ basically a four wheel drive bus without any comforts. The journey to Jericoacoara
took another hour or so and involved us driving over bumpy dirt roads before it opened up to a
long beach. Stray cattle, horses and donkeys appeared along the way, pausing momentarily to
acknowledge our vehicle before returning to their sporadic patches of grass atop the sand.

We arrived in Jericoacoara and caught one of the dune buggies to our accommodation at Bella
Vista where we were greeted by the lovely young couple Pedro (from San Paolo, Brazil) and
Mathilde (from Paris, France); they had arranged to spend 3-6 months in Jericoacoara
managing Bella Vista while the owners were holidaying, ironically, in the Caribbean. Our
room was very nice and we even had a hammock setup on our balcony that overlooked the pool, palm
trees and the nearby sand dunes. Amy and I changed into our togs and walked the 6-7 minute trip
along the sand to the beach.

Jericoacoara was once voted one of the top 10 best beaches in the world by The Washington Post,
but as a beach it didn’t have huge appeal. The town’s real value stood in its charm and
isolation – you really felt like a character from the movie The Beach , one of the lucky ones
who’d taken the punt to track down a location so far off the beaten track and had been rewarded
for your efforts. Standing on the beach and circling around you could see small fishing boats
grounded on the sand waiting for better tides, a handful of posadas (small hotels) and shops
put there to cater for the growing tourist market, some kite surfers making the most of
Jericoacoara’s notorious winds, a long beach with light grey sand separating the huge
dunes and the gentle ocean, and scattered locals flogging their wares.

Jericoacoara is one of the only places in Brazil where you can see the sun set over the ocean, and
it seemed like the daily event that united everyone in the town, locals and tourists alike, so
we joined the exodus up the sand dune to pick out our vantage point.



Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/day-one-sunset.jpg?w=1024&h=903

As wind-stirred sand lashed at our ankles, we admired the capoeiristas who were showing off
their acrobatic abilities, flipping and somersaulting on the sand and over the edge.Â 
Desperately envious, I asked for some pointers from the non-English speaking leader, but
after three frustrating minutes of him demonstrating me to simply do a backflip and me almost
putting my back out, I retreated with tail between my legs.



Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/caporeista.jpg?w=1024&h=856

For dinner we relied on the handwritten map provided by Pedro and Mathilde on our arrival.
They’d even taken the trouble to include the best restaurants and categorised them as one,
three or five star depending on price. We went for a mid-range three star play and were very
happy with the huge platter of chicken schnitzel, mashed potato and salad that we received.

The following morning, after an excellent sleep, we sampled the breakfast at our hotel. There
didn’t appear to be any other guests staying at the hotel (we were visiting in their extreme
low season) so we took our pick of fresh fruit and cereal before tucking into the eggs on toast
prepared especially for us.

Mathilde very kindly walked us to the stand-up paddle board shop on the main beach so we could
each rent one for an hour. Paddle boarding looked fairly boring when we had seen people in
Australia do it, and it was surprisingly difficult for the first 30 minutes trying to master
knee paddle boarding before we hit the big league. We were able to stand up without any
troubles, but the hard part was retaining your balance. Each time one of us boasted of a
successful get up, we would plunge into the ocean shortly after, as the other person laughed
uncontrollably. Amy reached her paddle boarding capacity about 40 minutes in and returned to
the beach, but I was starting to get the hang of it and began riding the small waves into shore.
Towards the end I had two minor collisions with the underwater rocks and managed to cut my feet
and hands.



Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/paddlin.jpg?w=1024&h=801

In the afternoon we opted for the horse riding tour offered by our hotel that took us over the
sand dunes, through some vegetation, and back along the beach just as the sun was setting.
Pedro introduced us to our guide chico (we werenâ€™t sure of his name) and we were shown to
our horses. They looked in better condition than the previous horses weâ€™d had, so we
were both excited about the adventure. Unfortunately they only had two helmets available,
and one of them was way too small, so Amy donned one helmet while I wore my authentic estancia cap
from the Argentinian ranch and we trotted off.



Image:
http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/riding-into-another-adventure.jpg?w=1024&h=620

Although chico could not speak even a single word of English, Amy requested we â€œno
galopaâ€� every time he said â€œ galopa â€� to avoid any injuries that could
arise from only having one helmet between us. I felt like Maximus from the movie Gladiator
â€“ my horse Chocolate was responsive and I was confident enough to guide him in the
necessary direction and to canter when required. Amy, on the other hand, refused the natural
whip (a thick blade of grass) chico provided and spent the whole ride about 50 metres back
trying hard to catch up.



Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/beach-cantering.jpg?w=1024&h=620

The ride showed off the amazing landscape around Jericoacoaraâ€”the huge sand dunes,
the sporadic palm trees and lagoons, and then the beachâ€”and we witnessed a
spectacular sunset as we cantered back to the main part of town.

For dinner we went out to our new favourite place Pimenta Verde and each had the delicious
shrimp risotto. The shrimp is caught daily, so the quality and freshness of the dish was a real
treat.

The following morning, Amy woke up first and spoke with Mathilde to organise a dune buggy tour
to the freshwater lakes, apparently the “must do” activity in Jericoacoara. Our driver
rocked up at 9.45am in a little red dune buggy and we eagerly jumped onto the back clutching the
metal bar behind the roof. We took off through the desert, along white sandy dunes, over small
water crossings, and then over a dirt trail cocooned by the green shrubbery. We felt like
soldiers in Iraq and I kept watch for any RPG-wielding insurgents. The entire time we sang
“Dune Buggy” from The Presidents and it never got old.



Image:

We arrived at our first destination Lagoa do Paraiso (Paradise Lake) and our driver informed
us, via hand gestures, that we had 1.5 hours there to relax.Â  Amy and I trudged through the
sand and were greeted by the most amazing lake weâ€™d ever seen. Dark blue water merged to
turquoise in the shallows, and a practical citizen had setup a number of aquatic hammocks so
you could relax with the 27 degree water gently lapping at your body. There was also a thin
wooden platform where we took some humorous photos in various diving poses.

Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/jason-air-bourne.jpg?w=640&h=803

We jumped back onto the dune buggy, recommenced singing the tune, and rocketed off to our next
destination. It emerged a short time later and was a small but pretty lake that seemed to appear
out of nowhere wedged between several huge sand dunes. We prepared ourselves for another
swim, but our driver turned and drove off. I guess these miscommunications happen when your
driver’s English is worse than your Portuguese.



Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/shoreline.jpg?w=1024&h=655

Ten minutes later we arrived at Lagoa Azul (Blue Lake) and we crossed the shallow 80 metre
channel on the resident sailboat. Azul was very similar to Paraiso, but without any wind, so we
ordered some drinks and enjoyed the aquatic hammocks. Jericoacoara had truly allowed us to
relax and forget the outside world, and the lagoas (lakes / lagoons) continued that trend.



Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/aquatic-gringos.jpg?w=1024&h=801

Our driver took us through more shrubbery, down the main street of a nearby town, and then to a
beachfront restaurant where diners actually sat on the sand. This restaurant was known for
the best grilled fish in the region, so we ordered the recommended shared dish and watched the
kite surfers making the most of the breeze in the small shorebreak just a stone’s throw from
our table.

Our meal arrived and, typical of Brazilian cuisine, it was enormous. The fish was delicious
and it was served with lime and a local root vegetable similar to potato, while side dishes of
carrot, rice, cous cous and beans ensured we would be well over capacity by the end. We shook
hands with the adolescent waiter (who may also have been the chef), hopped back on the dune
buggy, and hit some pretty high speeds along the beach back to Jericoacoara.

Amy walked into town to buy our return bus tickets while I made myself comfortable on our
balcony hammock to catch up on blog writing.Â  We opted for an arvo kip rather than the sunset
because we were both weary from dune buggying, horse riding the previous day, and the sheer
Jericoacoara heat. We had a quiet dinner at a previous place we visited and returned for a
relatively early night.

We woke up and it was 30 May – my birthday! Amy somehow had arranged a cake to present to me at
breakfast and she put a party hat on my head before many failed attempts at lighting the cake. It
was a very thoughtful gesture and I was grateful to her (and her co-conspirators Pedro and
Mathilde) for all the effort.

We doused ourselves in the mandatory sunscreen, lest you be charred by 10am, and walked to the
beach. I had intended to rent another stand up paddle board, but the waves were a bit smaller so
we spent our time sun baking, swimming and walking between the surrounding areas. For lunch we
had an incredible prawn and mushroom curry, served in hollowed out pineapple halves and
accompanied with salted potatoes and vegetables, from Pimenta Verde.



Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/pimenta-verde.jpg?w=801&h=1024

We slowly walked home and caught up on some calls / emails to keep a clear head for Amy’s
birthday present to me – a 1.5 hour massage with the local masseuse.

The masseuse turned up at our hotel and I was shown to one of the vacant rooms where the
air-conditioner was on and the massage table was setup. The masseuse couldnâ€™t speak
much English but she was a local woman and had over 15 years of massaging experience. Due to the
heat and the poorly positioned air-conditioner, we switched rooms and then had to switch
again. The massage was incredibly relaxing (I fell asleep at the end but was woken up by my own
snoring), but Amy and I couldnâ€™t help but laugh at some of the masseuseâ€™s
technical quirks, including punching our feet, pulling our necks back with a towel, and
quickly rubbing up and down our backs until they began to burn.

For dinner we went back to Pimenta Verde again and shared the fillet mignon special comprised
of eye fillet steaks, grilled bacon, and gorgonzola cheese sauce, accompanied by salted
potatoes and vegetables. I celebrated my birthday with a Skol beer, but was a little shocked
when I received a 750ml bottle. Not that it lasted long. It had been a wonderful birthday and I
was really appreciative of all Amyâ€™s hard work.

We woke up to a very hot day (circa 35 degrees) and strolled to the beach to hire a paddle board.
Unfortunately the shop owner was teaching a windsurfer, so we just swam around and relaxed on
some deckchairs. We returned to Bella Vista at 10.30am where we met a guy affiliated with our
hotel who would take us in his dune buggy to a well-known Jericoacoara landmark, a natural arch
built of rock on a nearby beach. To walk there and back was a 7km round trip, but in the heat and
with our poor navigational sense, we showed no hesitation in booking the dune buggy.

We parked near the arch and then walked 15-20 minutes at a very slow pace, through thick sand and
over rocks, to get there. Amy was battling in the heat and for a moment I thought the hot
Jericoacoara sand on this isolated beach was going to be her final resting place, but she
soldiered on and we made it. After some photos, we walked back with Amy psyching herself up
while I spoke to our driver about the Brazilian soccer team and how theyâ€™re looking for
the World Cup.



Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/famous-arch.jpg?w=863&h=1024

We had the same chicken schnitzel for lunch and then returned to our hotel for a quick nap before
our afternoon activity â€“ capoeira! Our instructor / sensei / coach / trainer,
whatever you want to call him, turned up at 3pm and we met him in the little capoeira hut right
next to our room. We were both exhausted from the heat, but thought having the commitment
scheduled would prod us to make the most of our time.



Image:
http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/junior-capoeiriste2808ba.jpg?w=1024&h=801

We both felt more natural doing the movements, although it was far more difficult following
directions because our instructorâ€™s only English words were â€œyouâ€�
and â€œunderstandâ€�, always used together and always in that order.
Nevertheless, we had an excellent time and I really enjoyed trying to master the more
acrobatic movements like one-armed handstands and cartwheels while Amy plucked the strings
of the main capoeira instrument to draw out its distinctive drone noise that set the pace of the
capoeira performance.



Image: http://ahjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/amys-new-hobby.jpg?w=801&h=1024

For dinner we returned to one of the only two restaurants weâ€™d been to in our time at
Jeriocoacoara (pretty much everything else was excluded from our handwritten restaurant
guide or closed due to the low tourist season), Pimenta Verde, but we were happy to go back so
frequently and they were happy to have us. We shared the famous â€œshrimp
tropicalâ€� â€“ the dish served in hollowed out pineapple halves. Afterwards, we
tracked down a gelato place for Amy; it looked like something out of New York â€“ it was
brand new and sported both innovative and professional design. Amy lapped up her cheesecake
and cookies and cream scoops while I went to work on dolce latte and Ferrero Rocher.

For our final day in Jericoacoara we walked to the beach, grabbed our usual table at Pimenta
Verde for the shrimp risotto, and packed our bags. We farewelled Pedro and Mathilde and hopped
on our dune buggy taxi to the bus stop. We were sad to farewell Jeri, but were excited for our next
adventure. We arrived to our hotel in Fortaleza at 8.45pm and were very happy to be staying away
from the Rolling Stone Hostel. Tomorrow we fly to Belem for three nights and then we board the
(hopefully) sturdy vessel that will take us down the Amazon River and into the jungle for some
anaconda, caimanÂ and piranha spotting.
