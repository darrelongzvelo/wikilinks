Plants and Curb Appeal - Keeping Them Healthy Patricia Kennedy (Evers & Company Realtors)



Image: /image_store/uploads/9/7/9/9/3/ar134387861339979.jpg

Lately, I've been noticing an awful lot of dead and wilted flowers at homes that are for sale. 
So yesterday, it was a real pleasure to see these very fresh and healthy blooms at a new Evers
listing on Underwood Street in Chevy Chase. 

If your sellers (or you) are starting out with healthy looking flowers, either inside or out,
it's important to keep them looking great, even with our hot, muggy rainy.

Lise Howe Cherishes Chevy Chase Village Lise Howe, Assoc. Broker and Attorney Licensed in DC,
MD, VA, (Keller Williams Metro Team Realty)

Chevy Chase was unincorporated farmland in the years before 1890, during which time

Image: /image_store/uploads/9/5/5/6/5/ar129091355056559.jpg

 Senator  Francis G. Newlands  of  Nevada  and his partners began the aggressive
acquisition of land in northwestern Washington, D.C., and southern Montgomery County,
Maryland, for the purpose of developing a residential streetcar suburb for Washington,
DC.  The Chevy Chase Land Company was founded in 1890, and its eventual holdings of more than
1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ) would extend along the present-day  C onnecticut
Avenue from Florida Avenue north to Jones Bridge Road. The Chevy Chase Land Company would
build houses for no less than $5,000 on Connecticut Avenue or less than $3,000 on a side
street.

The name â€œChevy Chaseâ€� was taken from one of the absorbed plots of land. Its name
in turn, according to the Village of Chevy Chaseâ€™s official history, can be traced to
the larger tract of land called â€œCheivy Chaceâ€� that was patented to Colonel
Joseph Belt from  Lord Baltimore  on July 10, 1725. It has historic associations to a 1388
battle between Lord Percy of England and Earl Douglas of  Scotland . At issue in this
â€œchevauchÃ©eâ€� (a French word describing a border raid) were hunting
grounds or a â€œchaceâ€� in the  Cheviot Hills  of  Northumberland and
Otterburn .

Even if Chevy Chase Village takes its name from a 1388 battle, there is no dispute now that it is
one of the favorite neighborhoods in the DC metro area.  This is a community that has
maintained its value and prestige through the recent market adjustment because everyone
loves its luxury homes like Grafton Streetâ€™s  historic Victorians with their wide
front porches and the beautiful colonials on  Hesketh and W. Lenox backing to the  Chevy
Chase Clubâ€™ s golf course.

When  buyers relocate to the DC area, it is hard to pick a community to live in if you are not
working with a good Realtor who knows the area really well.  There are lots of reasons to live
in Chevy Chase, but here are a few that I would give. Chevy Chase Village is an area just over the
DC line off Wisconsin Avenue, Connecticut Avenue, and Western Avenue, radiating off the
Chevy Chase Circle.  It is a great place to live for anyone who loves an urban/suburban
lifestyle.  You can walk to movies, restaurants, shops, grocery stores, and parks.  When
my son's friends were growing up in Chevy Chase Village, they were always happy to be able to
walk into DC for a movie or to take the metro at Friendship Heights and have a little bit of
carefully monitored freedom!  

FEATURED LISTING â€“ 24 Hesketh Street, Chevy Chase Maryland

Image:
http://dcmdvaluxuryhomeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hesketh-300x200.jpg

24 Hesketh

About 18 years ago there was a house on Hesketh that I fell in love with and wanted to buy, but the
real estate gods were not on my side.  What I am left with is an absolute love for this quiet tree
lined narrow street that runs parallel to one side of the Chevy Chase Club golf course.  24
Hesketh is listed by Long and Foster for $1,775,000 and has been on the market since November
12.  With 3 bedrooms and 2 baths on the second floor, this 1923 home has a beautiful wide front
porch and a family room/kitchen combination  renovated in 2009 and flooded with light at the
back of the house. Just in time for the holidays, you will love the wood burning fireplace in the
formal living room and the family room with its gas fireplace.  With a 7500 square foot lot,
there is room to play ball or have a cook out on the brick patio.   If this is not the luxury house
of your dreams, there are many others for sale in Chevy Chase Village, so just give the Lise Howe
Team a call.  Since Lise grew up in this area, she knows lots of secret listings and hidden gems
that will be perfect for you to call home.

FEATURED RESTAURANT â€“ LIAâ€™S â€“ (240) 223-5427  at 4435 Willard
Avenue

The interior of  Liaâ€™s  is very  simple, modern and clean .  The white linens,
soft lighting and candles make it a peaceful and

Image: http://dcmdvaluxuryhomeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lias.jpg
engaging space.  I know that the interior is pleasant but my favorite part of the restaurant
is out on the patio under a big red umbrella in the warm weather, watching the traffic going up
and down Willard Avenue and the people going in and out of  Whole Foods  across the street.  
It is such a nice way to spend a Sunday brunch or Saturday evening happy hour! The outside
location is perfect as a place to bring young children since there is room to move around! We
have even brought our standard poodle, Poirot, with us on occasion when we have eaten lunch
here, and the staff is great about it.

So â€“ how is the restaurant? It is an inviting combination of Tuscan warmth and Milanese
chic.   Whether you are looking for a robust, sophisticated Barolo wine, a creamy lobster
risotto, or a handmade fresh-raspberry gelato, you will be happy that you came.   One of my
favorite offerings at Liaâ€™s is the selection of sliced meats like speck or
soppresatta, fresh cheeses like talereggio or caprotta, and vegetables such as several
kinds of olives or marinated mushrooms which allow you to make your own antipasto platter.
 Great pizzas, salads, pastas and sandwiches are great complements to more sophisticated
offerings like risotto or steamed mussels.   A great way to spend an afternoon or evening!

FEATURED SERVICE â€“  Ramerâ€™s Stride Rite For Children



Image:
http://dcmdvaluxuryhomeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/striderite1.jpg When
my children needed their first shoes, I immediately went to Ramerâ€™s to have them
fitted for those important first shoes.  On Saturday mornings Ramerâ€™s is filled
with children being fitted for shoes by VERY PATIENT clerks!  The store is rocking with the
sound of children banging on the miniature piano in the middle of the room and contented
comments from parents satisfied with the selection and service.   They also keep a chart on
your child of their shoe size, and send you reminders when itâ€™s time to get a new pair.
 The wonderful news is that this great store has been around for more than 35 years, fitting
children from all over the DC area! As another mother said on her blog, while it is great to order
things online â€“ some things need to be fitted in person â€“ and a babyâ€™s
first shoes are definitely one of those items!

FEATURED EVENT -HANDELâ€™S MESSIAH AT THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL

Handelâ€™s masterpiece in the Cathedralâ€™s setting is the essential Christmas
music experience. A Baroque-period

Image: http://dcmdvaluxuryhomeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/messiah1.jpg
orchestra and guest soloists join the Cathedralâ€™s combined boy, girl and
menâ€™s choirs under the direction of Michael McCarthy. Soloists: Gillian Keith,
soprano; Marietta Simpson, alto; Rufus MÃŒller, tenor; Eric Downs, bass. The concert
lasts approximately 2 1/2 hours.

Audiences have been known to burst into song during the  Hallelujah  chorus and into tears
during  He Was Despised.  Certainly no other masterwork of religious music is as familiar
yet still as exciting as the first time you hear it. The Cathedral Choir, a Baroque period
orchestra, the Cathedral setting, and the Christmas season all combine to make this an
experience you wonâ€™t want to miss.

Performances are taking place on December 3rd at 7:30 and on December 4th and 5th at 4 pm.
 Tickets are available  on line  for $25 to $85.00.  See you there!
