Dixi

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0iq6Q7pXzhQ/TG9NKZ7z0YI/AAAAAAAAAK0/Y6xIsuv3Je4/s320/DIXI.jpg

History



The Dixi was the first car made by BMW .

Dixi was car brand of Eisenach car factory made from 1904; however, in the difficult climate of
the 1920s the company found it hard to sell its 6/24 and 9/40 models. The manufacturer looked to
enter the small car market, and in 1927 agreed to a licensing agreement with the Austin Motor
Company to build a variant of the Austin 7 . A production level of 2000 cars a year was agreed
upon, and Dixi paid Austin a royalty on each vehicle produced.

The first 100 cars were supplied as kits, but by December 1927 the first of the official
Dixi-manufactured vehicles, the DA-1 3/25PS were coming off the production line. The DA
designation stood for Deutsche AusfÃŒhrung, meaning German Version; 3/15 indicated the
taxation and actual horsepower ratings. Apart from being left-hand drive and using metric
fasteners, the car was nearly identical to the Austin. Body styles available were coupÃ©,
roadster, tourer, and sedan with a few chassis going to external coachbuilders. Most cars
left the factory as tourers.

Looking to move into automobile manufacturing, BMW bought the Automobilwerk Eisenach in
1928 and, with it, the rights to build the Dixi car. At first the cars were badged as BMW Dixi but
the Dixi name was dropped in 1929 when the DA-1 was replaced by a slightly updated version, the
BMW 3/15 DA-2. 0 what u think

DIATTO

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0iq6Q7pXzhQ/TG9MwXkpfjI/AAAAAAAAAKs/wLCFOwvF77U/s320/DIATTO.JPG

History



Diatto was an Italian car maker founded in 1905 in Turin .

The company initially built two and four cylinder cars based on the ClÃ©ment-Bayard , a
pioneering French manufacturer that was eventually absorbed by CitroÃ«n . By the 1920s,
Diatto was making quality cars of its own design, including race cars with supercharged
eight-cylinder engines. Diatto also supplied frames to Bugatti which used them for their own
race cars. Interestingly the Diatto insignia is markedly similar to Bugatti's with both
having horizontally oriented ovals surrounding the name of the maker all in capital letters.
Some Diatto racers were prepared and raced by the renowned Alfieri Maserati who left Diatto in
1926 to establish with his brothers, his own marque, Maserati , which would eventually become
much more famous than Diatto. A Diatto driven by Guido Meregalli was first in the 2-litre class
and overall winner of the 1923 'Circuito del Garda'.

Diatto cars were known for their innovative engineering and as early as the 1920s they were
equipped with four-wheel brakes and four-speed gearboxes.

Diatto ceased production in 1929. 0 what u think

History

The car was designed by US-born designer Tom Tjaarda [ 3 ] and replaced the De Tomaso Mangusta .
Unlike the Mangusta, which employed a steel backbone chassis , the Pantera was a steel
monocoque design, the first instance of De Tomaso using this construction technique. It made
its public debut in Modena in March 1970 and was presented at the 1970 New York Motor Show a few
weeks later. Approximately a year after that production Panteras started finding their way
into the hands of customers and production had already been ramped up to a remarkable (by the
standards of Modena-built exotica) 3 per day.

The curious slat-backed seats which had attracted comment at the New York Show were replaced
by more conventional body-hugging sports-car seats in the production cars: leg-room was
generous but the pedals were off-set and headroom was insufficient for drivers above
approximately 6 ft. (ca. 183 cm) tall. Reflecting its makers' transatlantic ambitions, the
Pantera came with an abundance of standard features which appeared exotic in Europe, such as
electric windows, air-conditoning and even "doors that buzz when ... open". By the time the
Pantera reached production, the interior was in most respects well sorted, although resting
an arm on the central console could lead to activating inadvertently the poorly located
cigarette lighter. [

The first 1971 Panteras were powered by a Ford 351 in 3 (5.8 L) V8 which produced 330 hp
(246 kW). The high torque provided by the Ford engine reduced the need for excessive gear
changing at low speeds: this made the car much less demanding to drive in urban conditions than
many of the locally built competitor products.

The ZF transaxle used in the Mangusta was also used for the Pantera: a passenger in an early
Pantera recorded that the mechanical noises emanating from the transaxle were more
intrusive than the well restrained engine noise. Another Italian exotic that shares the ZF
transaxle is the Maserati Bora , also launched in 1971 though not yet available for sale.
Power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes and rack and pinion steering were all standard
equipment on the Pantera. The 1971 Pantera could accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.5
seconds according to Car and Driver .

In the summer of 1971 a visitor to the De Tomaso plant at Modena identified two different types
of Pantera awaiting shipment, being respectively the European and American versions . From
outside, the principal differences were the larger tail lamps on the cars destined for
America along with "fender side-lamps". Not being a cost-accountant but a journalist, the
visitor was impressed by the large number of cars awaiting shipment: in reality spending the
best part of a year under dust covers in a series of large hangers probably did nothing for the
cash-flow of the business or the condition of some of the cars by the time they crossed the
Atlantic. The stock of unshipped cars may have been larger than usual since the US-bound cars
were still awaiting final homologation in respect their "push-button" door handles and
hand-built Carrozzeria Vignale bodies. A total of 1,007 Panteras reached the United States
that first year. Unfortunately, these cars were poorly built, and several Panteras broke
down during testing on Ford's own test track. Early crash testing at UCLA showed that safety
cage engineering was not very well understood in the 1970s. Rust-proofing was minimal on
these early cars, and the quality of fit and finish was poor, with large amounts of lead being
used to cover body panel flaws. Notably, Elvis Presley once fired a gun at his Pantera after it
wouldn't start.

  1972 De Tomaso Pantera Interior Several modifications were made for the 1972 model year
Panteras. A new 4-bolt main Cleveland Engine , also 351 in 3 , was used with lower compression
(from 11:1 to 8.6:1, chiefly to meet US emissions standards and run on lower octane standard
fuel) but with more aggressive camshaft timing (in an effort to reclaim some of the power lost
through the reduction in compression). Many other engine changes were made, including the
use of a factory exhaust header .

The "Lusso" (luxury) Pantera L was also introduced in 1972. It featured large black bumpers
for the US market as well as a 248 hp (185 kW) Cleveland engine. The 1974 Pantera GTS
featured yet more luxury items and badging.

Ford ended their importation to the U.S. in 1975, having sold roughly 5,500 cars in the United
States. De Tomaso continued to build the car, however, in ever-escalating forms of
performance and luxury for more than a decade. A small number of Panteras were imported to the
US by gray market importers in the 1980s, notably Panteramerica and AmeriSport. In all, about
7,200 Panteras were built. 0 what u think

De Soto

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0iq6Q7pXzhQ/TG9LejbkU_I/AAAAAAAAAKU/nHDg6KkgMYo/s320/DeSoto1961.jpg



History



The DeSoto make was founded by Walter Chrysler on August 4, 1928, and introduced for the 1929
model year. It was named after the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto . Chrysler wanted to enter
the brand in competition with its arch-rivals General Motors , Studebaker , and
Willys-Knight , in the mid-price class.

Shortly after DeSoto was introduced, however, Chrysler completed its purchase of the Dodge
Brothers , giving the company two mid-priced makes. Had the transaction been completed
sooner, DeSoto never would have been introduced.

Initially, the two-make strategy was relatively successful, with DeSoto priced below Dodge
models. Despite the economic times, DeSoto sales were relatively healthy, pacing Dodge at
around 25,000 units in 1932. However, in 1933, Chrysler reversed the market positions of the
two marques in hopes of boosting Dodge sales. By elevating DeSoto, it received Chrysler's
streamlined 1934 Airflow bodies. But, on the shorter DeSoto wheelbase, the design was a
disaster and was unpopular with consumers. Unlike Chrysler, which still had more
traditional models to fall back on, DeSoto was hobbled by the Airflow design until the 1935
Airstream arrived.

Aside from its Airflow models, DeSoto's 1942 model is probably its second most memorable
model from the pre-war years, when the cars were fitted with powered pop-up headlights , a
first for a North American mass-production vehicle. DeSoto marketed the feature as
"Air-Foil" lights "Out of Sight Except at Night" . 0 what u think

DE LOREAN



Image:
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0iq6Q7pXzhQ/TG9K-EhooiI/AAAAAAAAAKM/UZ6h_Dsk2FA/s320/DE+LOREAN.jpg





History

In October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean DMC-12 was completed by William T. Collins,
chief engineer and designer (formerly chief engineer at Pontiac ). Originally, the car's
rear-mounted power plant was to be a CitroÃ«n Wankel rotary engine , but was replaced with a
French-designed and produced PRV ( Peugeot - Renault - Volvo ) fuel injected V6 because of the
poor fuel economy of the rotary engine, an important consideration at a time of worldwide fuel
shortages. Collins and DeLorean envisioned a chassis produced from a new and untested
manufacturing technology known as Elastic Reservoir Moulding (ERM), which would lighten
the car while presumably lowering its production costs. This new technology, for which
DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.

These and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures. The
entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to
engineer Colin Chapman , founder and owner of Lotus . Chapman replaced most of the unproven
material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus. The Backbone
chassis is very similar to that of the Lotus Esprit . The original Giorgetto Giugiaro body
design was left mostly intact, as were the distinctive stainless steel outer skin panels and
gull-wing doors .

In an interview with James Espy of the resurrected DeLorean Motor Company in Texas, a drawing
surfaced showing that the car was potentially to be called Z Tavio. John DeLorean's middle
name and his son's first name were both Zachary while Tavio was his father's name and his son's
middle name. Due to only sporadic documentation, there is little more that is currently known
about the Z Tavio name and why it was ultimately rejected in favor of the DMC-12.

DeLorean required $175 million to develop and build the motor company. Convincing Hollywood
celebrities such as Johnny Carson and Sammy Davis Jr to invest in the firm, DeLorean
eventually built the DMC-12 in a factory in Dunmurry , Northern Ireland , a neighborhood a few
miles from Belfast city centre. Construction on the factory began in October 1978, and
although production of the DMC-12 was scheduled to start in 1979, engineering problems and
budget overruns delayed production until early 1981. By that time, the unemployment rate was
high in Northern Ireland and local residents lined up to apply for jobs at the factory. The
workers were largely inexperienced, but were paid premium wages and supplied with the best
equipment available. Most quality issues were solved by 1982 and the cars were sold from
dealers with a 12 month, 12,000-mile (19,300 km) warranty and an available five-year,
50,000-mile (80,000 km) service contract.

The DeLorean Motor Company went bankrupt in late 1982 following John DeLorean 's arrest in
October of that year on drug trafficking charges. He was later found not guilty, but it was too
late for the DMC-12 to remain in production. Approximately 100 partially assembled DMC's on
the production line were completed by Consolidated International (now known as Big Lots ).
The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as
well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were
all shipped to Columbus, Ohio in 1983–1984. A company called KAPAC sold these parts to
retail and wholesale customers via mail order. In 1997, DeLorean Motor Company of Texas
acquired this inventory. There has also been a long-standing rumor that the body stamping
dies were dumped into the ocean to prevent later manufacture. More recently, evidence
emerged that the dies were used as weights on commercial ships.

About 9,200 DMC-12s were produced between January 1981 and December 1982. Almost a fifth of
these were produced in October 1981. About 1,000 1982 models were produced between February
and May 1982, and all of these cars had the VIN's changed after purchase by Consolidated
International to make them appear as 1983 models. There are the 15XXX, 16XXX, and 17XXX VINs
which were originally 10XXX, 11XXX and 12XXX VINs. Only twelve 12XXXX VIN cars still exist. 0

Delage

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0iq6Q7pXzhQ/TG9Kbgw1e6I/AAAAAAAAAKE/0mJN9Zf_oE8/s320/DELAGE.jpg

History

Founded in 1905 by Louis Delage Rue Cormeilles in Levallois-Perret , the company was
initially just an assembly plant, buying engines and chassis from other manufacturers for
the dress body parts. The first model was a Delage Type A motor-cylinder De Dion Bouton 9 ch.

In 1907 the factory moved to rue Baudin Levallois in order to grow with 4 000 m2 workshop. That
year, Delage won the Grand Prix of France at Dieppe (500 km) at an 80 km / h average.

In 1908, the success enabled the development of the factory and entry into the Grand Prix
races. In 1912 the factory moved to new boulevard de Verdun Courbevoie always expand. The
following year, production of clean starts, and the creation of advanced bodywork. The brand
Delage began to win important races until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, when the
new plant in Courbevoie is converted to military use.





Competition

In 1911, cars Delage Type X designed by engineer Michelat won the Cup Car at Boulogne.

In 1913, the new type Y won the Grand Prix de France at Le Mans, and in 1914, this same car will won
the Indianapolis 500 with Rene Thomas.

In 1914, Louis DELÃ‚GE emphasized its focus on competition by creating the beautiful type
O Lyon Grand Prix, and moving towards the luxury car with 6 cylinders of a large class. Thomas
went to the United States and won the Indianapolis 500 with a Delage.

With the war, production of passenger cars virtually stopped, with the exception of some
fabrication for the Army. But the factories were running full support for the war effort.

D6 1918 After the return to peace, Delage sells splendid CO studied during the conflict and
made for the army: this is the first passenger car with front brakes. With these brakes and
engine 20 hp six-cylinder 4 524 cm3, which became in 1921 the CO2 Louis DELÃ‚GE done
Paris-Nice in 16 hours or 67 km / h average!

The 1920s ... are really the first "Golden Age" of Delage. Delage The most famous are the DE and
DI: any 2 of the 4 cylinders about 2 liters and 11 HP. It also attempts to compete with
Hispano-Suiza leaving the GL of 30 hp and 5 954 cm3, with some success. Then comes a new
generation of six-cylinder with the MD of 3 174 cm3 and DR 2 516 cm3, the best-selling vehicle in
the history of the brand, designed by engineer Gaultier.

In 1923, Louis Delage , who will return to competition at its highest level in innovating
building (engineer Charles Planchon) a fabulous 12-cylinder 2-liter: 2 the LCV. After a
promising start, the evolution of this car (engineer Albert Lory), will cover itself with
glory in 1924 (European Grand Prix in Lyon) and 1925 (Grand Prix of the ACF MontlhÃ©ry).
Meanwhile, to strengthen its communication strategy based on the principle of "racing
improves the technical and industrial production, he studied (and engineer Toutee
Planchon) 3 Car Race Coast Records and 6-cylinder and 12 cylinder. One of them, the 12 cylinder
DH of 10.5 liters in 1924 will beat the world record speed on the highway. In 1924, he set a new
speed record at 230 km / h. The first Grand Prix of Great Britain in 1926 was won by the French
Louis Wagner and Robert Senechal on a Delage 155B. The production of cars continues with the DI
and the DI S SS. The DM gives the DMS and DML, equipped with very nice 6-cylinder 3-liter
designed by Maurice Gaultier. Always passionate about racing, Louis Delage continues its
program and thanks to the hard work of the engineer Lory and technical resources committed by
the huge factory designs an 8-cylinder 1,500 cm3, the 15 S 8. This car, reliable and powerful,
driven by Robert Benoist will win 4 European Grands Prix of 1927, a necessary condition for
Delage become "World Champion of Builders.

1930, Louis Delage is always attracted by the luxury and "nice car". Maurice Gaultier designs
an eight-cylinder in-line 4 061 cm3, the D8 will evolve into D8-S (sport). It is that which
remains in the minds of many as the Delage ... Most beautiful clothing that body and chassis
Delage won the 1st place in most competitions elegance.



Delage D8 But the backlash of the economic crisis of 1929 arrived and the difficulties due to
poor sales accrue to manufacturers of luxury cars. Louis Delage nevertheless undertook an
extensive effort of renewal technique, aided by a group of dealers and bankers. Nothing helps
the commercial and financial situation of the firm is badly shaken. In 1932 comes the D6-11,
6-cylinder 2 101 cm3, and two years later the new eight-cylinder Delage: D8-15 2 768 cm3. These
two models, equipped with independent front wheels and an engine to the innovative
technology will not suffice to curb falling sales. The latest models that are emerging at
Courbevoie are D6-65 D8-85 and D8-105, also technically very interesting, and designed by
the brilliant engineer Michelat. Nothing will and support of Louis Delage steal one by one.
The voluntary liquidation of the factory in Courbevoie is decided April 20, 1935.



In 1935 Delage continues ... Delage But Louis would not admit defeat and had considered
numerous ways to save his company, the name that was so brilliantly illustrated in the
circuit, and the quality reputation of its products. Among these, a project will emerge and
will bring to Delage impetus and the creation of cars among the most successful brand, a sort of

De Dion-Bouton was a French automobile manufacturer and railcar manufacturer operating
from 1883 to 1932. The company was founded by the Marquis Jules-Albert de Dion , Georges Bouton
(1847-1938) and his brother-in-law Charles TrÃ©pardoux .

The company was formed after de Dion in 1881 saw a toy locomotive in a store window and inquired
about the toymakers, to build another. Engineers Bouton and TrÃ©pardoux had been making a
starvation living on scientific toys at a shop in the Passage de LÃ©on , close to the "rue de la
Chapelle" in Paris. TrÃ©pardoux had long dreamed of building a steam car , but neither could
afford it. De Dion, already inspired by steam (though in the form of rail locomotives) and with
plenty of money, agreed, and De Dion, Bouton et TrÃ©pardoux was formed in Paris in 1883. This
became the de Dion-Bouton automobile company, world's largest automobile manufacturer for
a time, becoming well-known for their quality, reliability, and durability.

History



The origins of Datsun

Further information: Nissan Before the Datsun brand name came into being, an automobile
named the DAT car was built in 1914, by the Kwaishinsha Motorcar Works (
å¿«é€²è‡ªå‹•è»Šå·¥å Ž , Kaishin JidÅ�sha KÅ�jÅ� ? )
, in the Azabu-Hiroo District in Tokyo. The new car's name was an acronym of the company's
partners' surnames:

    

    - Kenjiro D en ( ç”° å�¥æ¬¡éƒŽ , Den KenjirÅ� ? )

    

    - Rokuro A oyama ( é�’å±± çŠ„æœ— , Aoyama RokurÅ� ? )

    

    - Meitaro T akeuchi ( ç«¹å†… æ˜Žå€ªéƒŽ , Takeuchi MeitarÅ� ? ) .

    

Conflicting information: What's in a Name? The Change From Datsun to Nissan By Daniel Banks
"This despite Business Week’s error that Den, Aoyama, and Takeuchi founded Nissan. They
did not, of course. Kenjiro Den, Rokuro Aoyama, and Meitaro Takeuchi were 3 financial backers
and friends for one of the originators of the Japanese automobile industry, Masujiro
Hashimoto, who founded Kaishinsha Jidosha Koto, or “Kaishinsha Motor Car Works” in
1911."

The firm was renamed Kaishinsha Motorcar Co. in 1918, seven years after their establishment
and again, in 1925, to DAT Motorcar Co. DAT Motors constructed trucks in addition to the DAT
passenger cars. In fact, their output focused on trucks since there was almost no consumer
market for passenger cars at the time. Beginning in 1918, the first DAT trucks were assembled
for the military market. The low demand from the military market during the 1920s forced DAT to
consider merging with other automotive industries. In 1926 the Tokyo -based DAT Motors
merged with the Osaka-based Jitsuyo Jidosha Co., Ltd. (
å®Ÿç”šè‡ªå‹•è»Šè£œé€ æ ªåŒ�äŒšç€Ÿ ,
JitsuyÅ� JidÅ�sha SeizÅ� Kabushiki-Gaisha ? ) also known as Jitsuyo Motors
(established 1919, as a Kubota subsidiary) to become DAT Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd.
(
ãƒ€ãƒƒãƒˆè‡ªå‹•è»Šè£œé€ æ ªåŒ�äŒšç€Ÿ
, Datto JidÅ�sha SeizÅ� Kabushiki-Gaisha ? ) in Osaka until 1932.

The DAT corporation had been selling full size cars to Japanese consumers under the DAT name
since 1914 ( Madely , pg. 19), but in 1930 the Japanese government created a ministerial
ordinance that allowed cars with engines up to 500 cc to be driven without a licence. ( TOGO , pg.
11). DAT Automobile Manufacturing began development of a line of 495 cc cars to sell in this new
market segment, calling the new small cars "Datson" - meaning "Son of DAT". The name was
changed to "Datsun" two years later in 1933.( Madely , pg. 20)

The first prototype Datson was completed in the summer of 1931.( Nissan ). The production
vehicle was called the Datson Type 10, and "approximately ten" of these cars were sold in 1931.
( JSAE ). They sold around 150 cars in 1932, now calling the model the Datson Type 11( JSAE ). In
1933 the government rules were revised to permit 750 cc engines, and Datsun increased the size
of their microcar engine to the maximum size allowed ( JSAE ). These larger displacement cars
were called the Datsun Type 12.( Nissan Heritage ) 0 what u think

YP-408 used by UNIFIL In 1928 Hubert "Hub" van Doorne founded the company as Commanditaire
Vennootschap Hub van Doorne's Machinefabriek . His co-founder and investor was Huenges ,
managing director of a brewery. Van Doorne had repaired Huenges' car several times. Huenges
was so pleased with his work that he offered to lend him money if he wanted to start his own shop.
Hub started to work in a small workshop on the grounds of the brewery. In 1932 the company, now
run by Hub and his brother, Wim van Doorne , changed its name to Van Doorne's Aanhangwagen
Fabriek (Van Doorne's Trailer Factory), abbreviated to DAF . Huenges left the company in 1936
and the DAF company was now completely in the hands of the van Doorne brothers.

After the Second World War , luxury cars and trucks were very scarce. This meant a big
opportunity for DAF. In 1949 the company started making trucks , trailers and buses , changing
its name to Van Doorne's Automobiel Fabriek (Van Doorne's Automobile Factory). The first
truck model was the DAF A30 .

In the winter of 1954 Hub van Doorne had the idea to use belt drive , just like many of the machines
in the factory that were belt-driven, to drive road vehicles. In 1955 DAF produced its first
drafts of a car belt drive system. Over the next few years the design was developed and refined.
In February 1958 DAF demonstrated a small belt-driven four-seater car at the Dutch car show
(the AutoRAI ). The public reaction was very positive and 4000 cars were ordered. In 1959 DAF
started selling the world's first car with a continuously variable transmission , the small
four-seater DAF 600 . This was the first of a series of models to be released in subsequent
years, including the DAF 33 , DAF 44 , DAF 55 and DAF 66 , all using the innovative Variomatic
transmission system.

In 1967 DAF opened a new plant in Born for car production. The 44 was the first model to be
produced there.

In 1972, International Harvester of Chicago, IL bought a 33% stake in DAF (with the Dutch
government holding 25% and the Van Doorne family holding the remaining 42%), forming a
joint-venture. This agreement lasted until 1981.

DAF sold its passenger car division, along with what is now the NedCar factory in Born, in 1975
to the Swedish company Volvo Cars , leaving DAF to concentrate on its successful line of
trucks.

In 1987 DAF merged with the Leyland Trucks division of Rover Group , and was floated on the Dutch
stock exchange as DAF NV . The new company traded as Leyland DAF in the UK , and as DAF elsewhere.

DAF's successful 95 series was introduced in 1988, bringing DAF their first International
Truck of the Year title. The 95 brought new levels of driver comfort,(particularly with the
high-roof space cab variants) with ample space inside the well sprung cab. It featured DAF's
well proven 12 litre I6 ATi (advanced timed injection) engine in 310,350,360,400 and 430 hp
outputs, coupled to a ZF 16 speed range change/splitter gearbox. The basic cab design was so
good that it remains in production to this day, latterly as the 95XF and now the XF105, although
both these "developments" of the original 95 are totally different machines under the skin.
Other vehicles in the DAF range have included the inherited from Leyland trucks 7.5 ton
45(roadrunner), the cab of which was used in the 18 ton gross 55. also as a military spec 4x4. The
65,75 and 85 which all used the same daf cab, the 85 the highest powered of the three and designed
as the maximum weight variant. A short-lived model was the 1990-93 DAF 80, which made use of the
T45 Roadtrain cab acquired from the Leyland trucks takeover, fitted with Daf's own 330 ATi
engine.

DAF Bus was split off of in 1990 to become a part of United Bus .

Following difficulties in the British market, DAF NV went bankrupt in 1993. A new company, DAF
Trucks , appeared in the Netherlands as a result of a management buy-out of the Dutch
operations, as did Leyland Trucks and LDV (vans) in the UK.

In 1996 PACCAR acquired DAF Trucks. Interestingly, DAF Trucks and Leyland Trucks came
together again in 1998 when PACCAR also acquired Leyland Trucks.

The first passenger car, assigned the model number 600 , created a sensation when a prototype
was presented in 1958. The car featured a unitary steel construction, with a front mounted,
aircooled two cylinder boxer engine driving the rear wheels through a centrifugal clutch and
the Variomatic CVT transmission. The way this was constructed eliminated the need for a
differential, with the drivebelts taking up the difference of speed in the corners. This
acted as a limited slip differential. The car had independent suspension all round, with
McPherson struts and a transverse leaf spring at the front, and a coil sprung semi trailing arm
design at the rear. The first 600s rolled off the production line in the following year. The
next model was the 750 , featuring a larger 749 cc twin.

Later, DAF produced a more luxurious type called the Daffodil , divided into three models
assigned the numbers DAF 30, DAF 31 and DAF 32. The designation 32 was changed to 33 upon the 1966
release of the 44 , a larger middle-class vehicle designed by Michelotti . The 44 featured a
completely new design aesthetically as well as mechanically, but was of the same layout as the
"A-type's" (the 600,750,30,31,32 and 33), with the main difference being its 850 cc two
cylinder engine, and its full swingaxle rear axle design as opposed to the A-type
semi-trailing arms.

The 1968 DAF 55 carried a bigger watercooled 1108 cc OHV four cylinder engine derived from the
Renault 8 Cleon engine. Its body design was altered from the 44 by a new front which
accommodated the longer engine and radiator, bigger taillights, and a more plush interior.
The front suspension was changed from a transverse leaf spring to McPherson struts with
torsion springs and an antiroll bar.

The DAF 66 was introduced as a successor to the 55. It featured new, boxy styling of the front,
and a new rear axle design. The two drive belts now powered a differential, and the axle was
changed from a swingaxle design to a leaf sprung de Dion-axle. It was a major improvement over
the (tricky) handling of the swing axles of the earlier 33,44 and 55 models.

Volvo gained a large interest in DAF in the early '70s, taking over the company and the NedCar
plant in 1975. It dropped the 33 and 44 models, and rebadged the DAF 66 as the Volvo 66 , with
bigger bumpers and a safety steering wheel. The DAF 46 was developed under Volvo, and was
basically a 44, with the rear axle of a 66 and a single-belt variomatic (half the 66's
transmission). A big weakness of this system is that a failed drive belt would cripple the car.
The Volvo 300 series , introduced in 1976 had been designed as a DAF, with a Variomatic
transmission similar to that of a 66. 0 what u think

COTTIN & DESGOUTTES

History

  The Beginning

In 1904, Pierre Desgoutte started manufacturing automobiles under the name "Desgouttes &
Cie", in Lyon , France. The first model was the type A, powered by a 9.5-liter, 45 hp,
six-cylinder engine. Only two cars of this type were built.

In December 1905, a chassis with a four-cylinder, 24/40 hp engine was presented at the Salon
de Paris . It exhibited many innovative features and enjoyed a huge success. At the beginning
of 1906, Pierre Desgoutte was joined by a wealthy industrial partner, Cyrille Cottin. They
decided to call the new company "Automobiles Cottin & Desgouttes", Pierre Desgoutte acting
as Technical Director, whereas Cyrille Cottin would manage Sales.



  The pre-World War One period

The company progressively specialized in luxury and sports models.

Between 1906 and 1914, most of the production was devoted to four-cylinder models. En 1907,
the company produced a 2.5 liter, 12 hp model that was so well accepted by the public that is
was produced without any major changes for more than four years.

Over the next years, growth was regular and the factories thrived. In 1913, Cottin &
Desgouttes could be proud of producing close to 450 cars with a total staff of 300, which was
very high at the time, since the usual rule was one car per year per employee.

Well known for the very high quality of their production, Cottin & Desgouttes was also famous
for the interest they demonstrated in " high-tech " solutions: they were among the first to use
a single-block engine, direct drive transmission and universal joint-based transmission.



  Racing

The fame of Cottin & Desgouttes was also due to their participation in a number of car races.

As soon as May 1906, a Cottin & Desgouttes car driven by Fraignac won the Limones race in its
category.

Encouraged by this excellent result, the company decided to participate in more and more
important races, from the Press Cup in 1907 (where their car achieved the best gas mileage) to
the Grand Prix de France in 1911, in Le Mans , where the specially built model set the lap record
before having to abandon due to steering problems.

Cyrille Cottin, a great sportsman himself, drove at a number of races, rallies or other sports
events.



  World War One

At the beginning of World War One, the company produced a series of fast Utility Vehicles and
delivered several large 36 hp "Torpedoes" to the French Army General Staff. The
reliability of the trucks used by the Army was legendary.

During the war, Cottin & Desgouttes also built special engines for tractors. In 1915 the
Cottin & Desgouttes factory manufactured aircraft motors for Gnome et RhÃŽne .



  After the War

At the end of the War, Cottin & Desgoutte had well equipped production facilities, and their
financial situation was good enough to start again producing luxury cars. Their staff,
accustomed to high quality standards, easily moved from the war-time production back to
tourist cars. The manufacturing of trucks was continued.

In addition to the powerful models built immediately after the war, the company launched a
smaller, all new and lower priced car in 1922, the type M.

Shortly after this car was presented, Pierre Desgoutte quit the company. Paul Joseph,
selected by Cottin to replace him, was charged with building a more powerful and faster car,
based on the type M, and aimed at racing. One such car won the Grand Prix du Tourisme de l'
Automobile Club de France , which resulted in the launch of the "Grand Prix" model.

Around this time, Cottin & Desgouttes started his first research on aerodynamic profiling;
the results of this work were used in the 1925 models, most notably for the 4-seat
"boat-torpedo" with its streamlined rear.

In 1925, the company launched the "Sans-Secousse", with Houdaille-type paddle-based shock
absorbers and separate springs for the 4 wheels. At the front, the suspension was handled by
leaf springs with 2 vertical guide bars supporting the hydraulic shock absorbers; in the
rear, it was handled by oscillating semi-trees with double universal joints and 2
overlapping leaf springs.

When the car was presented at the Paris Salon, Gaston Doumergue , President of the French
Republic congratulated the Lyon car manufacturer for his historic invention, that would
promote the French Automobile Industry. Cottin reportedly replied that the government had
contributed to this invention - by the very bad quality of the roads. The Sans-Secousse was
also very successful outside of France.

In 1930, the first Saharan Tourist Car Rally was won by four "Sans-Secousse" cars that
demonstrated a high level of resistance. These cars were 14 hp sport roadsters, with no
wings or other useless accessories, yielding a high weight to power ratio, separate springs
in front and four leaf springs at the rear, with a de Dion -type bridge; they could drive very
fast even on low quality dirt roads.



  The Twilight

In spite of all these achievements, the company was yet another victim of the 1930s crisis. A
"Sans-Secousse" cost twice the price of a six-cylinder CitroÃ«n .

The last car built by Cottin & Desgouttes was much more conventional, powered by a lateral
3.8-liter, six-cylinder engine.

Production stopped in 1931. In 1933, the last Cottin & Desgouttes, assembled with stock
parts, were sold. 0 what u think

History

The Cooper Car Company was founded in 1946 by Charles Cooper and his son John Cooper . Together
with John's boyhood friend, Eric Brandon , they began by building racing cars in Charles'
small garage in Surbiton , Surrey , England in 1946. Through the 1950s and early 1960s, they
reached auto racing's highest levels as their rear-engined, single-seat cars altered the
face of Formula One and the Indianapolis 500 , and their Mini Cooper dominated Rally racing .
Thanks in part to Cooper's legacy, Britain remains the home of a thriving racing industry, and
the Cooper name lives on in the Cooper versions of the Mini (BMW) production cars that are still
built in England but are now owned and marketed by BMW .

The first cars built by the Coopers were single-seater, 500cc Formula racing cars driven by
John Cooper and Eric Brandon and powered by a JAP motorcycle engine. Since materials were in
short supply immediately after World War II , the prototypes were constructed by joining two
old Fiat Topolino front-ends together. According to John Cooper, the stroke of genius that
would make the Coopers an automotive legend—the location of the engine behind the
driver—was merely a practical matter at the time. Because the car was powered by a
motorcycle engine, they believed it was more convenient to have the engine in the back,
driving a chain.

Called the Cooper 500 , this car's success in hillclimbs and on track, including Eric winning
the first post war motor race at Gransden Lodge airfield, quickly created demand from other
drivers (including, over the years, Stirling Moss , Peter Collins , Jim Russell , Ivor Bueb ,
Ken Tyrrell and Bernie Ecclestone ) and led to the establishment of the Cooper Car Company to
build more. The business grew by providing an inexpensive entry to motorsport for seemingly
every aspiring young British driver, and the company became the world's first and largest
post-war, specialist manufacturer of racing cars for sale to privateers .

Cooper built over 300 500cc Formula Three cars and dominated the category, winning 64 out of 78
major races between 1951 and 1954. This volume of construction was unique and enabled the
company to grow into the senior categories; it was with a modified Cooper 500 chassis, a T12
model, that Cooper had its first taste of top-tier racing when Harry Schell qualified for the
1950 Monaco Grand Prix . Though Schell retired in the first lap, this marked the first
appearance of a rear-engined racer at a Grand Prix event since the end of WWII.

The front-engined, Formula Two Cooper Bristol model was introduced in 1952. Various
iterations of this design were driven by a number of legendary drivers - among them Juan Manuel
Fangio and Mike Hawthorn - and furthered the company's growing reputation by appearing in
Grand Prix races, which at the time were run to F2 regulations. It wasn't until the company
began building rear-engined sports cars in 1955 that they really became aware of the benefits
of having the engine behind the driver. Based on the 500cc cars and powered by a modified
Coventry Climax fire-pump engine, these cars were called "Bobtails." With the center of
gravity closer to the middle of the car, they found that it was less liable to spin out and much
more effective at putting the power down to the road, so they decided to build a single-seater
version and began entering it in Formula 2 races. 0 what u think

History

Luigi Colani , (born in Berlin on 2 August 1928 as Lutz Colani ), is a German industrial designer
whose father came from Madulain near St. Moritz in Switzerland and mother from Poland .

The prime characteristic of his designs are the rounded, organic forms, which he terms
"biodynamic" and claims are ergonomically superior to traditional designs. His "kitchen
satellite" from 1969 is the most prominent example of this school of thought. Many of his
designs for small appliances are being mass-produced and marketed, but his larger designs
have not been built, "a whole host of futuristic concepts that will have us living in pods and
driving cars so flat that leg amputation is the only option."

    

        The earth is round, all the heavenly bodies are round; they all move on round or
        elliptical orbits. This same image of circular globe-shaped mini worlds orbiting
        around each other follows us right down to the microcosmos. We are even aroused by
        round forms in species propagation related eroticism. Why should I join the
        straying mass who want to make everything angular? I am going to pursue Galileo
        Galilei's philosophy: my world is also round. — Luigi Colani

    

He has received numerous design awards.

Colani currently resides in Karlsruhe , Germany. His son Solon Luigi Lutz is also working as a
designer. He lives in Berlin , Germany. 0 what u think

History

Like many British specialist manufacturers, AC Cars had been using the smooth, refined
Bristol straight-6 engine in its small-volume production, including its AC Ace 2-seater
roadster. This had a hand-built body with a steel tube frame, and aluminium body panels that
were made using English wheeling machines. The engine was a pre-World War II design of BMW
which by the 1960s was considered dated. Bristol decided in 1961 to cease production of its
engine and instead to use Chrysler 331 cid (5.4 L) V8 engines. Although untrue, it is commonly
believed that AC was left without a future source of power and that American ex-racing driver
Carroll Shelby saved the company from bankruptcy. AC started using the 2.6 litre Ford Zephyr
engine in its cars. In September 1961, Shelby airmailed AC a letter asking them if they would
build him a car modified to accept a V8 engine. AC agreed, provided a suitable engine could be
found. He first went to Chevrolet to see if they would provide him with engines, but not wanting
to add competition to the Corvette they said no. Ford however, wanted a car that could compete
with the Corvette and they happened to have a brand new thin-wall small-block engine which
could be used in this endeavor. It was Ford's 260 in³ HiPo (4.2 L) engine - a new lightweight,
thin-wall cast small-block V8 tuned for high performance. In January 1962 mechanics at AC
Cars in Thames Ditton , Surrey fitted the prototype chassis CSX0001 with a 221ci Ford V8. After
testing and modification, the engine and transmission were removed and the chassis was
air-freighted to Shelby in Los Angeles on 2 February 1962. His team fitted it with an engine and
transmission in less than eight hours at Dean Moon 's shop in Santa Fe Springs, California, and
began road-testing.

Production proved to be easy, since AC had already made most of the modifications needed for
the small-block V8 when they installed the 2.6 litre Ford Zephyr engine, including the
extensive rework of the AC Ace's front end. The most important modification was the fitting of
a stronger rear differential to handle the increased engine power. A Salisbury 4HU unit with
inboard disk brakes to reduce unsprung weight was chosen instead of the old ENV unit. It was the
same unit used on the Jaguar E-Type . On the production version, the inboard brakes were moved
outboard to reduce cost. The only modification of the front end of the first Cobra from that of
the AC Ace 2.6 was the steering box, which had to be moved outward to clear the wider V8 motor.

The first 75 Cobra Mark I (including the prototype) were fitted with the 260 engine (4.2 L). The
remaining 51 Mark I model were fitted with a larger version of the Windsor Ford engine, the 289
in³ (4.7 L) V8. In late 1962 Alan Turner, AC's chief engineer completed a major design change
of the car's front end and was able to fit it with rack and pinion steering while still using
transverse leaf spring suspension . The new car entered production in early 1963 and was
designated Mark II . The steering rack was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column
came from the VW Beetle . About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced to the summer of 1965 (the last
US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).

By 1963 the leaf-spring Cobra was losing its supremacy in racing. Shelby tried fitting a
larger Ford FE engine of 390 in³. Ken Miles drove and raced the FE-powered Mark II and
pronounced the car was virtually undrivable, naming it "The Turd." A new chassis was
developed and designated Mark III .

The new car was designed in cooperation with Ford in Detroit . A new chassis was built using 4"
main chassis tubes (up from 3") and coil spring suspension all around. The new car also had wide
fenders and a larger radiator opening. It was powered by the "side oiler" Ford 427 engine (7.0
L) rated at 425 bhp (317 kW), which provided a top speed of 164 mph (262 km/h) in the
standard model and 485 bhp (362 kW) with a top speed of 185 mph (298 km/h) in the
competition model. Cobra Mark III production began on 1 January 1965; two prototypes had been
sent to the United States in October 1964. Cars were sent to the US as unpainted rolling
chassis, and they were finished in Shelby's workshop. Although an impressive automobile,
the car was a financial failure and did not sell well. In fact to save cost, most AC Cobra 427s
were actually fitted with Ford's 428 in³ (7.0 L) engine, a long stroke, smaller bore, lower
cost engine, intended for road use rather than racing. It seems that a total of 300 Mark III cars
were sent to Shelby in the USA during the years 1965 and 1966, including the competition
version. 27 small block narrow fender version which were referred to as the AC 289 were sold in
Europe. Unfortunately, The MK III missed homologation for the 1965 racing season and was not
raced by the Shelby team. However, it was raced successfully by many privateers and went on to
win races all the way into the 70s. Interestingly, 31 unsold competition cars were detuned and
made road worthy and called S/C for semi-competition. Today, these are the rarest and the most
valuable models and can sell for in excess of 1.5 million dollars. 0 what u think

History

Using Fiat parts as a base Dante Giacosa designed the D46 which made its successful debut in
1946. Giacosa had a vast knowledge of Fiat bits and pieces as he had designed the legendary 500
Fiat Topolino before WW II . The engine and suspension were directly derived from the small
Fiat but extensively modified for racing. The engine received dry sump lubrication and
further tweaks considerably increased the power output to 60-70 bhp. With a space frame [
citation needed ] chassis and weighing under 400 kg (880 lb) the available power was more
than enough for competitive performance. Dusio's dream of a one model series came to nothing,
but instead his D46s started to dominate the voiturette series. Highly talented drivers like
Tazio Nuvolari piloted the D46 to multiple successes against more advanced but older racing
cars.

This successes led to a much more ambitious single seater project that would prove too much for
the small company. Ferdinand Porsche was commissioned to design and construct a full Grand
Prix car which led to the innovative but complex Cisitalia 360 . With a mid engined layout and
four wheel drive the Type 360 was far too expensive for Dusio to support and the attempt
essentially killed any further racing cars. 0 what u think

Checker Taxi

History

Morris Markin, a clothier from Chicago, Illinois became the owner of a Joliet, Illinois
auto-body manufacturer when its owner defaulted on a $15,000 personal loan from Markin. The
facility made bodies for Commonwealth Motors who marketed the vehicles to cab companies
under the trade name Mogul.

Concurrently, Checker Taxi — a privately-owned cab company in Chicago that had no
affiliation with Markin — placed a large order for Mogul cabs with Commonwealth.
Commonwealth itself was on the verge of bankruptcy, so Markin merged the two companies in
order to honor the contractual commitment with the Chicago Checker Taxi. Markin named his
concern the Checker Cab Company. However, there was no overlap in ownership.

John Hertz began in the taxi business in 1910, both building Yellow Cabs and operating the
livery service. Because of plant overproduction, Hertz used the excess cars by renting them
to patrons through his "Yellow Drive-Ur-Self" division (the forerunner of Hertz Rental Car
). Seeing Hertz's success, Markin began buying up Checker's rolling stock in 1924, gaining
full control of Checker Taxi Cab in 1937.

Markin also followed Hertz's business plan in having drivers open doors for the fares, and
outfitted each driver with a uniform. Competition for fares was fierce in the 1920s, and the
easily spotted drivers began ganging up on one another between fares. The fighting between
the two cab companies escalated to the point where Markin's home was firebombed . This
prompted Markin to buy the Dort Automobile factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan and relocate
Checker.

Under Markin, Checker became the first cab company to hire African-American drivers and the
first to require that drivers pick up all fares, not just white ones.

Hertz had sold his Yellow Cab to the Parmalee Transportation Company, but in 1929, after a
suspicious fire at his stables killed his prized race horses, Hertz left the cab business,
with Markin buying Hertz's shares and then acquiring another one-third in the company from
Parmalee, thus taking control of both Parmalee and Yellow Cab.

While Hertz had sold off the cab business, the manufacturing arm went to General Motors , which
wanted to sell it and made Markin an affordable offer. Markin refused. Rather than eliminate
the capacity of Yellow Manufacturing, General Motors entered the taxicab business as
Terminal Taxi Cab, and a second fare war broke out, with Checker and Terminal fighting it out in
New York City . To end this dispute, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker created the New York Taxi Cab
Commission, which ruled that all cabs in New York had to be purpose-built cabs, not consumer
car conversions.

Markin sold Checker Cab to E.L. Cord , but bought it back again in 1936. In 1940, Parmalee
(including Yellow and Checker Cab) became the largest cab company in the United States.
Eventually, the cab company revenues exceeded those of Checker's automotive building
division, and the company decided to enter the consumer passenger car business in 1961.

In 1964 the State of New York pursued Markin and Checker on antitrust charges, alleging that it
controlled both the taxi service and manufacture of taxis, and thus favored itself in
fulfilling orders. Rather than allow Checker drivers to begin buying different brands of
cars, Markin began selling licenses in New York City.

In 1977, seven years after the death of Morris Markin, retired GM President Ed Cole bought into
Checker with the intent of re-energizing the company and developing a new, more modern
Checker. Cole's plan was to purchase partially completed Volkswagens from VW's new factory
in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania. Cole was going to ship the VWs to the Checker Motors factory in
Kalamazoo, cut them in half, insert a section to lengthen the VW, raise the roof and then sell
the reconfigured vehicle as a taxi. Shortly thereafter, however, Cole was killed when his
plane crashed near Kalamazoo.

With the Marathon thoroughly outmoded and no longer selling in viable quantities, and
lacking the resources to develop a new model, Checker decided to leave the auto manufacturing
business. The Marathon design dated back to the mid 1950s which caused Checker a number of
problems. There had been several minor changes to the design. First, impact absorbing
bumpers were added when required by federal law and then the steering column/wheel were
changed when a collapsible column was also required for safety reasons. The rear fold-down
jump seats were also removed as they failed all safety tests. The car had very poor gas mileage
as the tall front end and engine compartment had been designed for a Continental engine, which
required the large engine compartment. [ citation needed ] When production of that engine
ceased, in 1960, [ citation needed ] Checker began offering either the Chevy 230 cu in (3.8
l) I6s or 283 cu in (4.6 l) small block V8 . Checker added a 327 cu in (5.36 l) Chev in 1966.
These were used until the late 1970s. When GM ceased making the straight six, Checker
purchased a small V-6 also used in Chevrolets. The large, tall grill and hood made for poor
aerodynamics which was part of the reason for the low gas mileage. So a number of the V-6s were
converted to use propane as fuel. Many of the body stamping dies were worn out after over 20
years of continuous use and that required manual body adjustments by body and fender
mechanics to make the parts fit. The fenders and doors were the parts with the most problem fit
as taxis are involved in numerous minor accidents due to their extensive, often 24 hour a day
use. The last models were produced for the 1982 model year, and the final automobile rolled off
the assembly line on July 12, 1982.

Checker Motors operated until 2009 as an automotive subcontractor , primarily for General
Motors, building mostly body components. 0 what u think
