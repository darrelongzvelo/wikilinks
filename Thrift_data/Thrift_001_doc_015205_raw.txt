The War Game (1965)

Posted by spdk1 — May 20, 2012

4



There is nothing more terrifying than watching a â€œwhat-if?â€� film about a
nuclear holocaust. If done correctly, such programs can really stir fear in oneâ€™s
heart and make anyone think about the ramifications of such an event to their lives. I
particularly remember watching the American TV movie The Day After some years ago, and while
not acted in the best manner, it was disturbing in many ways. First of all it was filmed in my home
state, using buildings and town names that Iâ€™m used to, and it showed what could happen
after a nuclear bomb falls. I can only imagine how messed up it would have been had they had done
it as a faux documentary rather than a drama, it would most likely have ended up like BBC
â€™s The War Game â€“ a far superior film, and much more scary. A film like this is
only as powerful as the time we live in, and today much like the sixties, we live in fear of idiots
flaunting their missiles all over the world. This short black-and-white film was recently
added to Netflix instant streaming, so I figured that it would be interesting, little did I
know it would also be amazing.

Produced in manner similar to a documentary-styled magazine program, The War Game tells the
story of a nuclear crisis in the â€œnear futureâ€� of the 1960â€™s Britain.
The whole mess starts when China invades South Vietnam , an act that America sees fitting to
retaliate for with a decree of nuclear intentions. This idea angers all of the Communist
nations leading to a small-scale nuclear war in Berlin between the two German halves and a
handful of allies on either side. Eventually, it all escalates into an all-out World War with
Britain getting hammered with over sixty bombs.



Image: http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/war-game-family.jpg?w=541&h=415

This film shows everything thereafter including the collapse of society, sick people, and
mental traumas resulting from the bombings. What follows is a scathing look at how the
director, Peter Watkins , sees Britainâ€™s preparedness for such an event. All that
â€œstiff upper lipâ€� stoic nature from the blitz goes out the window in this
documentary, and everyone turns into animals once things get bad. All Civil service agencies
are lampooned as well as church elders, but this is not humorous satire, this is the stuff of
nightmares.

One of the most unnerving segments in this film was a series of black cards with white lettering
read by the narrator. Throughout the film, these cards come up to show facts, news quotes,
maps, and other tidbits that really help this to look like a news show. The most poignant ones
were statements from officials such as government workers, press agents, and other high up
big-wigs. The card that creeped me out the most concerns the manner in which the church took
notice of the bombings, coming together to issue the following odd statement:



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/war-game-vatican-card.jpg?w=440&h=330

“The church must tell the faithful that they should learn to live with, though not love, the
nuclear bomb, provided that it is â€˜clean’ and of a good family.”

And later:

â€œDuring a recent meeting of the Ecumenical Council at The Vatican â€“ a bishop
told the press that he was sure â€œour nuclear weapons will be used with wisdom.â€�

With how â€œout of realityâ€� the church tends to be these days, Iâ€™m not too
convinced that something like this wouldnâ€™t leave the lips of a spokesman at the
Vatican today! Iâ€™m not sure whether to take stuff like this as black comedy much on the
same way that Dr. Strangelove handled such things, or a hard condemnation on how stupid and/or
heartless people can be. With our politicians today, I think the latter is most fitting.

The written content found within isnâ€™t the only thing that makes this film so dark.
Itâ€™s also filmed in a manner reminiscent of actual news footage â€“ meaning that
they created staged building collapses and deaths, and filmed it all with a handheld camera to
make it far more realistic than many movies of the time. This was Cloverfield , only forty years
early. For the 1960â€™s, these special effects are amazing and would honestly look
great if used in a modern production. This isnâ€™t a cardboard walls Doctor Who budget,
this was made to look as real as it could to strike fear. I think the only effect that was sort of
â€œiffyâ€� was the way in which they depicted nuclear blasts. Since they
didnâ€™t have computer generated effects back then, and stock footage is tiresome, we
didnâ€™t see any mushroom clouds. Usually somebody would be outside and the screen
would flash white for a moment, leading the actor to cover their eyes and scream. While not
great, this effect does its job, and doesnâ€™t look unrealistic, just uninspiring. It
was like hearing the sound effects from an off-screen battle in a Lord of the Rings movie, some
of the impact is taken away if you canâ€™t see it.



Image: http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/war-game-lady.jpg?w=515&h=396

Gritty scenes such as one featuring a group policemen being forced to employ mercy killings on
people so severely injured that doctors could not help them seems so out of place for any film
made in the 1960â€™s. I can see why this film was immediately hated by higher-ups at the
BBC, as it basically mocked authority on all levels. Also, if people used to call in to complain
about things in Doctor Who in the 1970′s being “too scary” this would have given these
same people heart attacks. I cannot stress how much this seems like a modern film in terms of
tone and nature. The War Game didnâ€™t actually get shown on any TV network until the
mid-1980â€™s, and Iâ€™m thankful it didnâ€™t meet the same fate as other
1960â€™s BBC productions â€“wiped and junked. It was deemed too dark, it made the
British infrastructure look bad, it belittled civil servants, and it stood in the face of
over-zealous national pride â€“things that werenâ€™t cool forty years ago. At
least now we can watch it, and enjoy it without any censorship involved.

Another scene that really struck me, on a deja vu level, was one that was used much later for a
plotline in a David Tennant era Doctor Who episode called Turn Left . In The War Game , threats of
an imminent nuclear strike force the evacuation of millions of people to the country-side.
The streets run foul with protests and uncertainty as many households were forced to take in
and feed as many as eight guests for the duration of the events. People caught on camera include
many that act very selfish; this includes people trying to hoard resources and even bigots.
One woman interviewed remarked that she hoped her new lodgers â€œwerenâ€™t
coloredâ€� as was the norm back in the sixties.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/the_war-game-blindfolded-man.png?w=440&h=312

The aforementioned Doctor Who version of this happened in a similar manner. In Turn Left , the
Earth fell to utter ruin when the titular character died in an alternate reality. His
companion at the time, Donna as played by Catherine Tate , was forced to board with other people
when London is totally destroyed in a nuclear accident. The racial sentiment is still jarring
now as it was in the sixties, and it really shows that accidents and other catastrophes bring
out the worst in people. Iâ€™m really surprised that there havenâ€™t been a lot of
people that have picked up on this connection between the two shows accidental or
intendedâ€“ then again this movie may be pretty obscure due to its age and its banned
status.

If you want to see a great disaster movie that doesnâ€™t resort to over-the-top special
effects in lieu of drama, please check this out. For a film that I assumed would be schlocky
1960â€™s faire, The War Game was awesome. This movie is so dark, violent, pessimistic,
and edgy, that one would assume that it came from the brain of a modern director. Since it was
shelved so long ago, I feel that many have not seen a true speculative fiction classic. I know
this kind of film is not for everyone, itâ€™s sort of depressing, and makes you feel bad.
But that shouldnâ€™t stand in the way of the punch in the gut you get watching it.

Survivors (2008) Episode 3

Posted by spdk1 — May 9, 2012

0



Itâ€™s been a while since I did a write-up for this Survivors ; I guess I had a lot going on
and got a bit sidetracked. Recently, I got hooked on a U.S. based reality show called The Colony
, in which people are made to live in a situation resembling a post-apocalyptic virus
outbreak; I immediately thought of Survivors. A lot has happened in the first few episodes of
Survivors , and now that the main cast is all together, itâ€™s time to break everyone up
into little groups to look into the inner-workings of their characters. In the last episode,
we had things like Al finally opening up – moments like this are really the best thing the show
can offer. We get two such occurrences in this episode: Â Abby in one case, and Greg and Tom in
another.



Image: http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/survivors.jpg?w=440&h=214

In the first half of the story, Greg and Tom come across a family that has somehow managed to stay
isolated during the viral outbreak . The father of this family goes to insane lengths to
protect his family, such as forcing his kids to stay inside at all times. If he sees any living
creature, whether it is an animal or human, it needs to be killed to preserve their unaffected
status. He bathes in harsh chemicals if he steps outside, and burns his clothes afterwards.
This is all done because he loves his kids, but this extreme nature does nothing but bite him,
when he attacks Greg and Tom. They are forced to hide in this manâ€™s barn for a bit after
their car is destroyed, and accidentally expose the daughter to the virus. This brings up a
very bad situation where the father must choose for the daughter to leave with two unknown
strangers, or to stay there and possibly kill the rest of the family.

After seeing some terrible new 2012 inspired American TV shows such as Doomsday Preppers , the
attitude of the father makes me a bit sad. His paranoia for the unknown nature of the virus makes
his entire family miserable, and resent him. In the aforementioned program, people hoard
food, make ridiculous precautions, make their kids run paramilitary drills and other stuff
that seems to be a great idea, but as Survivors illustrates, would just end up failing anyway.

The other half of the episode sees Abby coming across a haven for other survivors while she is
out looking for her son. This camp is run by Samantha Willis, possibly one of the few government
heads left alive after the virus hit. While the place initially looks like a utopia as it has
food, electricity, and multiple survivors of all ages, it has a dark secret. These people
donâ€™t like outsiders, and have a warlike relationship with a group of marauders that
are trying to share the wealth. Problems like the viral epidemic seem to bring out the worst in
people, a running theme in this show, and a place like this colony go from being awesome to just
as bad as the gang that our characters met with in episode two.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/survivors-2008-samantha-copy.jpg?w=440&h=276

I liked this episode a lot because of the above situations the characters are forced into. The
story of the little girl is heartbreaking, and was the highlight of the show drama-wise for me.
Iâ€™ve seen other shows recently like Outcasts that try to be an interesting drama with a
bit of science fiction flavor, but end up being a glorified snuff film to make the audience feel
bad. These gruesome acts take the place of good writing, but fail to do anything for me.
Survivors doesnâ€™t rely on shock tactics and we see a bit of the other side of drama
â€“ warmth. The scenes were the remaining Survivors help build a chicken coop while
Abby, Tom, And Greg are out gives this slow a glimmer of hope, and thatâ€™s why I can always
come back to it.

A for Andromeda (2006)

Posted by spdk1 — April 14, 2012

2



I first heard about A for Andromeda in an unlikely, although not surprising, place. I had never
heard of the original 1961 television series for two reasons, first, one can blame the fact
that I am American and was born in 1982, secondly, one can look to the loss of most of the original
program via the old BBC â€œwho gives a crapâ€� archival policy on filmed material.
This was the very same policy that destroyed countless old Doctor Who episodes and many other
historically important shows. There was a Documentary on a DVD set called Lost in Time , in
which orphaned Doctor Who episodes were pulled together so that they could be released in some
way. This documentary filled me in on this â€œjunkingâ€� situation and mentioned
more things lost forever, including a show called A for Andromeda , touted as being one of the
first BBC science fiction programs. I must have gone to Wikipedia or some such, as I had quickly
discovered that a remake was out thereâ€Š.and here we are.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/a-for_andromeda_tom_hardy_2.jpg?w=440

The serial opens with a â€œzooming in on the earthâ€� shot eerily similar to the one
from Rose , a 2005 episode of the resurrected Doctor Who . This shot was re-used on that show, and
its spinoffs, countless times in the last few years; this really makes me wonder if the BBC had
to keep using it for some reason. Like maybe the BBC spent a ton of money for it and needed to make
ends meet by using it hundreds of times? Maybe a test group rated it the best part of the program
so that drove its implementation on every show? I think itâ€™ll be one of the great
mysteries of our time.

Much like 2005â€™s Quatermass Experiment (which I need to review as well), A for
Andromeda has an inexpensive look and feel, and yet stays away from a â€œcheapâ€�
appearance. Shows like Hyperdrive go the opposite route and try to look â€œBIG!â€�
on a budget, and end up looking incredibly dated and cheap in the process. The use of
â€œshaky camsâ€� and small sets gives it a far less cinematic vibe than Doctor Who,
but makes each scene interesting. In many cases the camera is right in the middle of dialog, as
if you are somehow part of a conversation taking place. This makes the production remind me of
an independent film, and makes it more charming in many ways. If youâ€™re one of those
people reading this and asking â€œwhy should I watch a six-year-old TV special that looks
like an indie film?â€� there might be something of interest here. The main character,
John Fleming, is played by none other than a pre-muscular Tom Hardy . Itâ€™s almost
comical seeing him play a scrawny scientist considering his â€œtough guyâ€� roles
he has been getting lately. This show really proves that he is a very versatile actor, and could
easily become a superstar in the future.



Image:
http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/a-for_andromeda_tom_hardy.jpg?w=440&h=234

The story of A for Andromeda follows a group of scientists that discover a microwave signal
coming from the Andromeda Galaxy . Once decoded, this signal is turned into a computer program
that could be a huge breakthrough for all mankind â€“ or be its undoing. The plot is a
fairly hard science fiction (as in scientifically sound) story without all the bells and
whistles that decorate many modern productions. Most British science fiction relies on
concepts and dialog rather than sheer spectacle, and I believe this very program is a good case
for this distinction between British sci-fi and US sci-fi. While this story is one of the
productions biggest strengths, it is also a huge fault in the grand scheme of things.

Hard sci-fi relies on realistic takes on the genre, so one would imagine dialog and concepts
that show great care in â€œkeeping it realâ€�. Instead we get material in a similar
vein to all those procedural crime dramas on U.S. TV. A scientist pounds on the keyboard, says
some technobabble, and *boom* something amazing happens that is truly unrealistic to modern
science. It is in this way that while A for Andromeda tries to be â€œhard sci-fiâ€�
itâ€™s really more of a drama â€“ Like sci-fi for the CSI crowd.

I really liked this show despite its over-simplification of things, and itâ€™s
resemblance to a type of TV that I really do not enjoy. The acting is great, the direction is good
considering the budget, and the actors involved all do a great job. For me, the highlight
really was seeing Tom Hardy playing something different from a gangster or assassin, and fans
of his should really check this out.

Doctor Who: The Mutant Phase

Posted by spdk1 — February 13, 2012

1





Image: http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mutant_phase.jpg?w=440

After weeks, even months, of listening to the void of soundless boredom, I started taking my
iPod to work this week in order to keep occupied for my long ten hour shifts. Since I do not want to
listen to the same songs every day, I decided to load up on podcasts of varying topics, and a few
Doctor Who audio dramas. As you may have noticed by a few earlier posts, I am attempting to
listen to all of these Doctor Who Audio plays by Big Finish in order, and one would assume that I
would review them as such.

I realized that I had gone far too long without keeping notes, writing things down, and
generally getting ready to write any reviews. So guess what? Iâ€™m going to re-listen to
a lot of these in order to keep these up rather than going off of memories of these plays that
could date back to over one year ago. You never know, I may end up liking dramas I previously
hated (there are actually two I never finished of the forty or so I have heard, I need to fix
that). Luckily this drama did not make my â€œpoop listâ€� the first time I listened
to it according to my iTunes star rating, and stayed just as enjoyable the second time around.

Â 

Synopsis

In the 22nd century, the Daleks have occupied planet Earth. By the 43rd century, only a handful
of humans survive. Still further into the distant future, a Thal scientist must choose
whether to betray his heritage, or see the universe destroyed.

When the Doctor and Nyssa find themselves trapped in this deadly chain of events, they must
decide who their real enemies are. What is certain, however, is that no matter where the Doctor
turnsâ€Š his arch enemies, the Daleks, will be waiting for him.

What could possibly be worse than that? The Mutant Phase…

The Mutant Phase has an immediate bonus for me in that it is a re-visitation of my favorite
Doctor Who serial The Dalek Invasion of Earth . For those unfamiliar with that title, said
episode was an important episode for many reasons: it was Susanâ€™s last appearance as a
regular companion, it was the first serial shot on location, it was the second Dalek
appearance, and it was so popular that it was one of two stories to be remade into a feature film
starring peter Cushing. Going back to such a classic episode is a cool idea, and thankfully we
get the setting as more of a â€œbookendâ€� to the meat of the story rather than a
â€œfanwankyâ€� total revisit.

In that episode, the Tardis crew including Susan, Ian, Barbara, and the first incarnation of
the Doctor, arrive in a bleak post-apocalyptic and Dalek infested England in 2167. What
really made The Dalek Invasion of Earth stand out for me was the chilling use of vacated
landmarks during location shooting, and the utter bleakness of the overall story. For a
â€œkidâ€™s showâ€�, this episode had a lot of dark things like signs saying
not to dump dead bodies in the river and humans turned into a slave work force.Â  What we have
here with The Mutant Phase can be seen as a â€œprequelâ€� of sorts to this classic
episode as we see The Doctor As played by Peter Davison and his companion Nyssa arrive a few
years earlier, to a time where Daleks have never met the Doctor and donâ€™t meddle in time
travel.

My only real quibble with the episode rears its ugly head in this introductory portion of the
episode. The Doctor realizes pretty quickly that they are somewhere in the state of Kansas,
which for foreign readers, is located in the United States. While looking through a field of
genetically altered crops infested with wasps, The Doctor and Nyssa stumble upon a
â€œRobomanâ€� guardsman, a zombie-like policeman for the Daleks. By zombies I
donâ€™t mean the Romero-esque eating brains and rotting away living dead variety, but
the classical use of the term as in brainwashed servant. Not to be confused with Cybermen,
Robomen are just regular people with some sort of mind control device implanted onto their
heads.

So anyway, this roboman gets America back for the dreadful British accent Dick Van Dyke used in
Mary Poppins , by delivering his dialog in the worst, most overdone, American accent out
there. This can partly be chalked up to the dronish manner in which the robomen characters
talk, but behind all the reverb and monotone was a glimmer of a vocal style not heard since The
Apple Dumpling Gang . I seriously hope that many in the U.K. do not think all Americans talk like
1890â€™s old prospectors, but I get the inclination that it may be the case. I think Mark
Gatiss was responsible for the voice, as he is credited as such! All joking aside, this small
slip-up was very minor, can be overlooked easily, and does no harm to the play itself.

This play has quite a few interesting characters, and chiefly among those are two Thal
scientists, Ptolem and Ganatus, both forced to work for the Daleks to stop the mutant phase. We
hear a lot of mentions of these guys before we see them interact with the Doctor, so their
motives stay hidden for the majority of the play. Another nice addition is Karl Hendrick, a man
that lives in the dark and studies old relics from our current history. He gets quite a few great
one-liners and funny moments making him one of the better side characters.

Aside from a couple of minor things like over-done foreshadowing that Nyssaâ€™s wasp
sting may be important in some way, the plot of the Mutant Phase was well done, and revolved
around some good olâ€™ fashioned â€œtimey-wimeyâ€� stuff involving a
temporal paradox. With any paradox based episode the resolution didnâ€™t exactly wrap
the whole thing up in a bow â€“ a fact that is actually made fun of in the dialog. When the
Doctor explains what has happened to Nyssa at the end, she tells him that it simply made no
sense, to which he replied â€œparadoxes donâ€™t make senseâ€� or something
vaguely similar. Admitting this, the play somehow jumped over any plotholes it may have
obtained whilst jumping between a multitude of timelines. For me this was nice, humorous
touch.

While not the classic of its older brother, The Mutant Phase is a competent audio drama that
keeps one entertained throughout. Keeping in mind that the Daleks are the only race that the
doctor has ever really considered committing mass genocide on, listening to him being forced
to work alongside the horrible creatures is compelling and makes this a must listen.
Iâ€™ve been lukewarm on the Dalek Empire Releases so far, but this one has really
redeemed the series, canâ€™t wait to hear whatâ€™s next.

British Science Fiction VS American Science Fiction: Why All The Fuss?

Posted by spdk1 — September 17, 2011

1



Anyone stopping by this site might wonder why exactly I donâ€™t just talk about ALL
science fiction, I mean itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t watch stuff from my home country
at all. Keeping in mind that I am a Star Trek fan, Iâ€™ve dabbled in Star Wars , and I love
some old Buck Rogers , that doesnâ€™t excuse the fact that I am shamelessly addicted to
stuff from the â€œother side of the pondâ€�. The question remains, is there really a
difference to the two different styles, can one distinctly draw a line between the two sides
and separate them? For me, the answer is yes.

I think the main difference can all be chalked up to the argument of mood vs spectacle with the
British productions geared heavily towards atmosphere, mood, and concepts and most
American helmed productions relying mostly on spectacle, visuals, and special effects. As
one can imagine, most of this can be chalked up to budgetary constraints, as anyone with access
to millions of dollars in production budget would love to make something as grand as Star Wars ,
but if you are given far less you may have to settle for Blakes 7 . What this usually means is that
the actual scripting for these British programs has to be scripted to concentrate on tension,
horror, and relationships versus escapist imagery. This forces the writers to go for ballsy
content that will grab viewers and hold them; while there are a few American scifi shows that
have taken this route, many â€œwuss outâ€�.

A prime example of this neutering of concept in favor of spectacle can be seen in the American
version of Life on Mars , a remake of a UK show from a few years ago. At first glance, the shows seem
similar, but anyone will immediately notice a stark difference between the two. First and
foremost, we have the production values in place hammering away any subtlety in concept.
Instead of filming in antiquated areas, and keeping things dingy, the American show goes for a
smooth veneer of CGI effects on things to add in the twin towers and other relics to constantly
remind us of another time.

Image: http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/lifeonmarsus1x1.jpg?w=415&h=232

Screw subtlety, here we have "shock and awe"

I was constantly baffled by the use of yellow lense filters to instill a weird vibe on the show,
it made it look like portions were filmed on Venus or something. I know folks had a hideous
concept of color back then, but wouldnâ€™t it be better to actually use sets with yellow,
green and brown things in them instead of just tossing a filter over everything? Itâ€™s
not like the sky was yellow back then, though I was born in the 1980â€™s so maybe I missed
that memo. This basically ruined the show for me right from the beginning because it makes it
hazy and hard to see anything in any of the shots. Instead of thinking â€œman, Gene
Huntâ€™s office has terrible dÃ©corâ€�, I thought to myself â€œwhy is he at
work at sundown in a foggy yellow-lit room?â€� While both shows do a fairly decent job of
keeping the early 1970â€™s fashion and hairstyles in check, the American one looks a bit
too â€œshinyâ€� and somewhat gratuitous. The acting seems more
â€œHollywoodâ€� and fake, and everything looks too clean and sterilized. Even the
classic cars seem to all be from car shows, no spec of dirt on any of them. The U.K. Life on Mars
excels on â€œnot trying too hardâ€� and succeeds by keeping everything simple. The
U.S. version tries far too hard, and as a result fails.

Another huge misstep is the overall casting of the show. In the original, Sam was a normal sized
guy, athletic but not too large. This was at odds with Gene Huntâ€™s large size and
physicality. We were to believe that if the two were to ever get in a fight, Hunt would decimate
Sam with sheer size and brute strength. Instead we have a Sam that towers over Hunt, a sixty year
old Hunt to be exact. I know Harvey Keitel is a well-liked actor, but how am I supposed to believe
that he is a hardass, if it looks as if he could break a hip at any moment. Everyone else looks
â€œtoo prettyâ€� if you get my drift, nobody looks like a real person, and it seems
like they cast the show from a modeling agency.

Image: http://spdk1.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/water.jpg?w=376&h=209

Dear God! Why is the sky yellow?

My final real problem is that the show has been whitewashed to be more politically correct. In
the original Gene Hunt is not a nice man, he is a corrupt cop that uses his rank to bully everyone
around him. Aside from that he is a chauvinist, he is racist, he is homophobic, and he has the
manners of a drunken frat guy. While a bit of that stays in, things like racist views are taken
largely out, as to not offend people. I can see why this happened, but the whole point of the
character is to show an exact opposing view to Sam, someone that Sam tries so hard to avoid
being. This way, when Gene starts to soften up, especially in the sequel show Ashes to Ashes , he
is that much more endearing.

I could keep going, but Iâ€™d rather not nit-pick the entire show to death. Truth is, had I
never seen the original version I still would have been annoyed by the show, and probably not
finished it.

By doing this comparison, I am by no means belittling American science fiction as the inferior
product, but it does show why one can almost never truly adapt a program from there to here, our
sensibilities are so different. On the flip-side imagine a show like V (the new one) being
created in the U.K., it would be an entirely different show. So yes, there is a difference in the
two brands of sci-fi, and I prefer one over the other.
