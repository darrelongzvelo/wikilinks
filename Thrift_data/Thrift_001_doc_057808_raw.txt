Holiday rap

It looks like virtually everyone wants a February holiday.



Spurred on by the introduction of "Family Day" in neighbouring Saskatchewan, local radio
jocks Tom and Joe at 92 CITI have been waging a campaign the past while, including an online
petition with thousands of signers. Late last week the Free Press got on the bandwagon.



But it looked like the Manitoba government was the big stick in the mud with labour minister
Nancy Allen turning a cool shoulder on the idea, saying it wasn't a government priority at the
moment.



Tom Blowback wakes up to the issue today, giving credit to the CITI guys and others for driving
the issue and slamming the premier as Gary-come-lately, while not saying where he stands nor
why the Sun never woke up to this issue at all.



Either on purpose or accident, he gets the history of this little thing totally wrong.



"The issue even made it on the agenda at the NDP convention over the weekend, receiving
overwhelming support from voting delegates," he writes.



Even made it on the agenda?



Here's the last line from Mia Rabson's Jan. 31 story previewing the NDP convention:

"There is competition afoot over a statutory holiday on Feb. 15. The St. Norbert NDP wants it to
become Flag Day, while the Riel constituency wants the same day designated Tommy Douglas
Day." Not just MADE it onto the agenda, but there were two competing resolutions.



Further, as Tom wouldn't know or bother to find out, the deadline for submission of such
resolutions from constituencies was Dec. 19.



So just so everyone is clear, the party was WAY ahead of CITI and the others.



Now that a February holiday seems like an unstoppable train, it's little wonder Tom took a pass
on his usual modus operandi of quoting the largely interchangable
Batra-Starmer-Martin-Angus surrogate Conservative Party talking heads to begin mounting
an opposition campaign.



He's not that dumb.



If the government didn't want to seem ahead of the issue too early and simply be slammed as
"anti-business" by the same baying proxy Tories mentioned above, who can blame them?



The way it's turned out, Gary Doer should get credit for bringing in the holiday with
Manitobans and credit within the party for turning a grassroots convention resolution into
law.



And he can also credibly tell the business community it wasn't an idea the nasty socialist
government has foisted upon them, but a widespread movement that all parties got behind.



It's just too bad it doesn't look like it's going to be "Tommy Douglas Day", but a day off next
February sounds pretty good to us.

Vic's stenographer

Today CTV reports that the C-17 contract is all but signed and Quebec is "only" getting about
25%-30% of the desirable aerospace contracts, while Manitoba retains about 20%.



On the surface, this appears to contradict reports Quebec senior cabinet minister, Sen.
Michel Fortier, whose signature is needed to finalize any deal, would not sign the papers
unless 40% went to Quebec firms. These suggestions raised the spectre of the CF-18 affair -- an
episode in pure pork barrel politics from a Conservative government in Ottawa with Manitoba
at the losing end over Quebec.



Following that point in time, even mentioning Brian Mulroney's name in this province could
cause fisticuffs for years to follow.



However, today's news would seem to vindicate Tom Blowback’s recent column asserting
forcefully (particularly forcefully) that the reports of Fortier's interference were just
that -- made up, invented reports by malicious media types.

"Just a media "report" alleging he's "reportedly" doing it (that's media-speak for we don't
really know but we'll say it anyway), regurgitated by other media and splashed on the front
page like a cow's breakfast at dinner time." Slap down time, Tom! Nice one. Hit 'em agin'.



Of course Tom went on to extensively quote Vic Toews about how the whole thing was nonsense and
after all, Fortier was never quoted anywhere saying anything like that.



True enough.



But isn't it odd that several national media had attributed in separate stories comments like
that to Fortier at the same time, quoting senior, yet anonymous, federal government sources?
Did they really just make it up? Or could they have been just repeat something some idiot told
them without checking?



What's the deal?



Consider this from the Globe and Mail this past Tuesday, by reporter Daniel Leblanc:

"Public Works Minister Michael Fortier, who is also the minister responsible for Montreal,
had been fighting behind the scenes to obtain the "maximum for Quebec," a government source
said. But Mr. Fortier failed to secure benefits in the 40-per-cent range for Quebec as he had
hoped, and the government is now publicly thwarting any effort to increase benefits in favour
of a specific region...



"The issue has created touchy relations between Mr. Fortier and the Department of National
Defence, which wants the planes as soon as possible and feels that his demands for benefits in
Quebec are unrealistic." Seems like it maybe wasn't all nonsense now, does it? A quick Google
search of Daniel Leblanc and you find out he's a veteran on Parliament Hill and one of the
journos who broke the sponsorship scandal (whut dat?).



So, you decide who's more likely to have had the goods: an investigative journalist with
serious sources in Ottawa, who stands by his story even after official government denials; or
a cartoonish Winnipeg columnist who regularly does steno work for Vic Toews?



-----------------------------



So why did Fortier actually lose? Because of the great power of Vic Toews?



Hmm. Maybe.



Or maybe the PM remembers all-too-well CF-18 and how it served to alienate the West from not
just Eastern Canada, but from Mulroney's Tories, giving rise to the Reform Party.



He should remember it very well, yes?



-------------------------------



ANNOUNCEMENT: We're introducing a new feature called Kevvie Watch. In today's instalment,
we merely want to extend our well wishes to the soon-to-be-former-(again) MLA for Inkster who
plans to pay for an observer seat at the NDP convention this weekend. Enjoy yourself, sir.
We're sure the party will gladly take your money. (Try a few raffle tickets while you're

BBA Mulligan day

We're well behind in commenting on things we wanted to over the past while. So we take this
opportunity to write a few brief things on breaking stuff, and a couple of Mulligans from the
last week or so:



CF-18 redux? Hard to tell at this point. Sen. Fortier's letter in the FreeP this morning has him
denying media reports quoting him saying more than 40% of the Boeing C-17 contracts must be in
Quebec before he'll sign. On the other hand, in the math of the upcoming federal election,
Harper will give a much bigger damn about Quebec than he will Manitoba.



Good news for Harper. A clear sign that Stephane Dion has poor political instincts is the story
reported in the Quebec City newspaper Le Soleil yesterday that he would not object to the
lifting of the Liberal's ban on senior organizer Marc-Yvan CÃŽtÃ© -- a former Quebec
cabinet minister and central figure in Adscam. (Unless we missed it, there didn't seem to be a
story in either the FreeP or the Sun. Odd. It's a big story in our view.)



Wheat Board. Manitoba farmers overwhelmingly voted to support single desk selling. There
was some griping from Wheat Board opponents, but no one can credibly argue that the majority
has not spoken clearly and loudly in this province about the future of the CWB.



Ironically, on the day of the result, Chuck Strahl complained about the Manitoba vote and said
question was torqued, then immediately announced there would be a federal vote on wheat
(after giving no such assurance in the past). Then, a few days later, his office releases what
his version of the question (or as it turns out, three questions) that are so meaningless, if
asked they will only highten producers' anger -- even many who would have been open to
monkeying around with the Wheat Board. Strange strategy.



"They may as well have asked if farmers would like to sell their barley to little green men from
Mars for $200 a bushel," said NFU president Stewart Wells.



Good line.



Wonder one of the first people to propose a Clarity Act for any future referendum in Quebec
might hand a copy over to Strahl? Nah. Clarity's fine for Quebec, but Westerners are better off
with double- and triple-speak.



Tory/Liberal candidate in Kirkfield Park? Just bizarre , actually. Email This BlogThis!

Hugh's revamped site hosts loony right views

Our sharp-eyed readership noticed that Huey has revamped his personal webpage, and on it
there are a selection of news articles that, of course, either praise him and the PCs, or dump on
Gary Doer and the NDP.



Not too surprising.



Odd, though, is this little missive from the Western Standard (entitled "Manitoba's
Spirited Status Quo" -- ho, ho, ho, chortle -- good one). The Standard is a Republican-yahoo
wanna-be publication from Alberta. In this case its writer, Calgary Herald scribbler Ric
Dolphin gives an interesting and highly inventive view on Manitoba's political scene -- for
the clearly uninterested, navel gazing oilpatch crowd.



Well, there's perhaps no accounting for taste among Huey's staff, but nonetheless it's a very
strange piece to put on your site. The implication of course, without any disclaimer as a fig
leaf at all, is that Huey heartily endorses the views expressed therein.



Here, then, is a little taste of the views that Hugh apparently agrees with:



"The poll came after the Tories had knifed their former leader, Stuart Murray, in November,
forcing the confidence vote that led to the leadership campaign. Murray, 51, a former roadie
with Blood, Sweat and Tears, and married to the heiress of the Domo gasoline fortune (slogan:
"We Jump to the Pump"), was a nice, bland, ineffectual chap who lacked the killer instinct and
seemed polite in legislative debate.



"McFadyen is youthful, glib and urbane in the way that his old boss Filmon once was. He even
looks a bit like Filmon in his salad days--compact, slick and stock-brokerish. He's well
connected to the Winnipeg Tory establishment that revolves around the brokerage firm
Wellington West, where guys like Filmon, now 63, ply their trade among the antique beams and
sandblasted brick in the gentrified Winnipeg warehouse district. McFadyen also has those
ties to the moneyed Jewish crowd of which his former boss, the well-liked self-made
multimillionaire Mayor Katz, 54--arguably the second most powerful elected official in the
province--is the political pontiff."



Knifed their former leader?



Well connected to the Winnipeg Tory establishment that revolves around the brokerage firm
Wellington West?



Glib?



Well, these nuggets happen to be true, but kind of astonishing he'd put them on his site.



Here are some other memorable quips in the piece:



"[Manitoba is] this black hole at the geographical centre of the Dominion ..."



"In the leadership race that had McFadyen pitted against two conservative Conservatives
from the sticks..."



"The only growth appears to be among the native Indian population, and that fact, alas, brings
the predictable social ills..."



Nice. Very nice.



On the point of that last quote, we Googled this Dolphin guy, 'cause his name kinda rung a bell
and we found out why.



Last year he wrote a piece on the Klein legacy (whut dat?) and the Alberta Conservative
leadership. It got some attention for the following:

"Colleen's [Klein] influence is seen as destructive and her motives less than altruistic.
'Once she stops being the premier's wife, she goes back to being just another Indian,' says one
of Klein's fishing buddies, in an unkind reference to Colleen's Native heritage. 'Colleen
likes being picked up in a car with security and being driven to her next function,' says a
longtime campaign manager close to both Kleins." And in 2003 he was whacked by the Alberta
Press Council for several pieces that were pretty negative on Aboriginal people, including
calling Aboriginal communities "nests of hopelessness ... the road to hell ... and a society
in shambles." The council also found "(t)here were many other statements in the columns that
the complainants found offensive."



You think maybe this guy has issues or something?



The council fined Dolphin's employer, the Asper-owned Calgary Herald. Wonder if those
articles will show up on display in the Museum of Human Rights?

Hmm, it looks more like straw on the ice than "sweeping away", but if you say so ...

“I wouldn’t say I’d never consider it but it’s not something I’m considering right
now.”



That's from Mia Rabson's blog re: the rampant rumour we put flesh on a while back about Jennifer
Jones running for Team Huey. Rabson says this puts the rumour to rest. However, the quote
doesn't exactly sound like it's being put to rest to us -- there's more wiggle room there than in
a (Bill) Clintonism.



On the other hand, perhaps she has indeed closed the door for this time around. She may well have
followed our advice and called Hugh's bluff, thereby blanking the end and dashing McFadyen's
hopes of Jones as his button draw.



Ugh, enough with the metaphors.



-------------------------------



We note our best buddy Tom Bunkbeck's latest installment in his one-man-mission to convince
all that Manitoba is the worst s***hole on the planet.



He tees off today by refering to the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce 's "Making Manitoba a Have
Province" campaign as proof that our economy is in the crapper.



Well, if that's the Chambers' goal, it certainly isn't stated anwhere we could find. In fact
they seem to accentuate the positive as often as possible:

It begins with what we are calling a ‘grand discussion’," explains MCC President Graham
Starmer, "One that has the courage to ask the tough questions, builds on a common vision and
moves to concrete action." Starmer says too often talk amounts to finger pointing, and
harping on our differences and what divides us, rather than building on what unites us. Who can
argue with that?



All the negative stuff in their campaign that we could find seems to be relegated to this sorta
weird "Manitobans have a collective character flaw" language:

The Making Manitoba a ‘Have’ Province pamphlet sets out three basic issues that are
holding us back: we lack the courage to ask the tough questions, we lack a commitment to the
vision, and we lack a course of action. In any event, does anyone believe the Chambers won't
come forward at the end of this campaign and say the results of their consultations show there
should be deep tax cuts, especially for business?



No, of course no one belives that. It's their job. It will be expected.



An interesting thing, though, is Brodbeck's selective use of the Manitoba Chambers'
campaigns.



On this one, he points to it as proof the province is in terrible shape -- which of course (a) is so
far from the truth it's laughable and (b) even his readers don't believe it.



However, we recall that Tom was less moved by the other recent "attitude change" campaign the
Chambers are a huge part of -- the Spirited Energy provincial branding project.



Ah well, that wouldn't fit his "s***hole" thesis, would it? Email This BlogThis! Share to

News flash: candidate claims party offered deal to step down from nomination (yawn)

So, let's get this straight -- the internal NDP tempest-in-a-teapot that is the Maples
nomination/Kaur Sidhu issue is to the opposition a massive scandal, so big it should delay any
thoughts of calling an election (if that were the Premier's intention).



Well, we already dealt with the situational hilarity of that one a few days ago.



The interesting thing is the story that popped up in the past few days about federal Tory
hopeful, Ottawa lawyer Alan Riddell, who withdrew in consideration of Adscam
whistleblower, Allan Cutler. (You can read the tale here , here , and here .)



Riddell maintains he dropped out only after cutting a deal that he would be financially
compensated by the party. Last week Riddell won his case in court for some $50,000 against the
Conservatives.



Stephen Harper and party president (and Manitoban) Don Plett denied there was any deal. But
the party dropped that argument later and said Riddell voided the deal by speaking publicly
about it.



None of that held water in the end for the judge, ordering the Tories to pay Riddell.



OK, so where's the outrage from Manitoba conservatives and their blogging rabble over this
one? Absolutely nowhere to be seen.



And unless we've missed something, no one has been saying this is something that deserves any
investigation beyond paying Riddell what he's owed.



This must change! We must get behind an unstoppable movement to make the Tories pay dearly for
this, this, this ... thing. No?



Hmmm. Yawn. Snnzzzzzk.

Tory nomination news

It is curious with all the Tory blogs spouting nomination news that they either miss or avoid
the one that is of most interest.



We mean, really, the Waddells move on Winnipeg (we loved the "our work is done here" line about
rural Manitoba -- very reassuring to urban folks). That's significant?



Trudy Turner in Riel? What's that going to be like? "Hi, I couldn't beat weird old Harvey Smith
where I'm known. I'm taking on Melnick who's liked locally and where the NDP is strong." Wow,
good one.



Or how about Zyla, who at least surprised the pundits about River Heights--Fort Garry in
placing quite respectfully?



Kerri Irvin-Ross may have won by a hair in 2003, but the provincial riding of Fort Garry has
become very working class in recent years and Kerri has done lots of strong constituency work
(apart from recent her elevation to cabinet).



But as we're on the topic of Fort Garry, let's also consider the last public domain Probe poll
for a second.



In our first take on it, we postulated from the Free Press story that Probe was probably showing
the NDP leading in the southwest quadrant. Indeed, now that Probe has posted the results, that
is actually the case (in their numbers at least): 39 for the Tories, 44 for the NDP, 13 for the
Liberals.



Remember, this is a quadrant which -- as we've pointed out before -- has four non-NDP ridings in
it, out of a total 9 1/2.



That would seem to indicate a possibly very tight race with the NDP in at least one of those
non-NDP seats (Tuxedo -- Heather Stefanson, Charleswood -- Myrna Dreiger, Fort Whyte -- Hugh
McFadyen, River Heights -- Jon Gerrard).



Or, as we would say more likely, the NDP's hold on its incumbents has probably become quite a bit
stronger than people think.



So, dear reader, you decide what that means. Does it mean that Ms. Zyla or her evangelical
teacher opponent (or some other candidates that have been rumoured) needn't bother running
in Fort Garry, or does it mean Hugh and Heather have to actually worry about holding onto their
seats. Hmm.



We think the former is more likely, but are willing to entertain the latter.



However, the most interesting thing is what's coming out of the leaky ship that is the HMS Huey,
which has spouted in the direction on more than one occasion toward the BBAs.



We're sure it has spouted in others, but we can only speak to what we know.



We hear that not only has women's curling champ Jennifer Jones , a lawyer at Crocus-central,
Wellington West, been hurrying especially hard at Tory events over the past year or so, but is
now definitely looking at trading her hack for working for one.



She's 90% along the way of spurning the pebbled ice on behalf of Team Baby Huey, to challege
Health Minister Theresa Oswald in Seine River.



Clearly the PCs see Jones as a star candidate and hope this will give them some octane in their
tank come the provincial election.



The unfortunate thing for the PCs' hopes in Seine River is rather less optimistic and it comes
on several counts.



The first good thing as mentioned above -- the riding in question which had in the past been a
Tory stronghold is likely now a pretty safe NDP seat, considering the overall NDP support in
the quadrant and the fact that the local representative is a popular MLA who is now the health
minister.



The other important thing to rememember is that star candidates, athletes in particular,
often don't work out as hoped. Yes, there is Montreal Canadiens' legend Ken Dryden who won his
Toronto-area seat for the Liberals and became Human Resources minister. However, he won in a
safe Liberal seat beforehand (a condition Dryden had insisted on before agreeing to run, we
understand). And it's not as if he overwhelmed while in the minister's office, or afterwords
as a leadership candidate.



And it must be remembered, for every Ken Dryden, there is at least one Daniel Igali.



We also understand that Jones and her people have asked for a Seine River riding poll, which the
PCs have been reluctant to commission (or hand over, if they already have one).



The stated reason for not doing a riding poll, apparently, is that of not wishing to expend
scarce pre-election resources and the Tories are telling Jones she could take the seat
handily without any testing of the waters.



We say that's fantasy-land.



Word is also, however, that Jones is becoming a tad wary (hence the word of her candidacy being
kept to a very few top Tories), though she has basically committed and feels it's going to be
very hard for her to back out considering the level of conversations that have happened.



We submit that if she wanted to avoid the liklihood of losing, she should stick to the mantra of
demanding a riding poll before she throws her hat in officially. If Huey agrees to this demand,
she will see that she has been fed a line.



And if he doesn't agree to this condition, she's got a good reason to back out.



Our public service has been done for the day. Carry on. Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter

Here, Goertzen, you put on the chicken suit -- I have to, um, wash my hair today ...

OK, we nearly herniated something today from laughing so hard when we found out that the Tories
did a flop-flop on calling an election.



Let's be more specific -- the Tories and the Liberals now say they don't want an election any
time soon.



The new comedy team of Kevin and Kevin (as in "I love Vic Toews" Goertzen and "I'm crazy -- really
crazy" Lamoureux) joined forces to express the opposition parties' demand today that the
premier hold off an election, pending Election Manitoba's investigation of the NDP
nomination spat in the Maples.



"Whaaa?" you say. "Since when does an opposition admit it's scared of an election, even if they
are?"



Excellent question, you sharpie, you.



First off, no sane person would think the accusations in the Maples by a disgruntled New
Democrat over internal NDP business is of such import that it should have any effect on whether
the premier should call an election.



After all, other accusations by a sitting MLA -- Denis Rocan to be precise -- about his party's
malfeasance in manipulating the Carmen nomination against him makes the Maples issue look
ridiculously tame, whether any of it is true or not (we suspect not, though).



But unlike the Premier who sent the Maples accusation to Elections Manitoba immediately,
Huey has done absolutely nothing with the stinker in his own back yard (neither has Rocan, it
must be said, even though he should).



Second, wasn't Hugh just raring to have an election called only a few weeks ago?



Why, yes he was. Here's Hugh in the House on November 30, 2006:



"He's [the Premier] got two options today, Mr. Speaker. Call an inquiry [over Crocus] or call
an election. If he won't call an inquiry, will he call an election today?"

Wow. Huey sounded pretty confident then. Pretty cock-sure, eh?



Today, though, it seems not so much the case.



Perhaps that's why he passed off the job of wearing the chicken suit to Goertzen, rather than
face the embarrassment of doing the public flip-flop himself.



Why the difference today, you ask? Why the change of heart?



Well we know why with Lamoureux. He's in big trouble facing a very strong NDP challenger who's a
prominent member of the Filipino community. This is also why Kevvie grabbed this little issue
and tried to wring every ounce of publicity possible from it -- going so far as to commit a
probably regrettable act of defamation in the legislative hallway aimed at Michael Balagus
that may well soon go to the courts.



But what about Hugh?



We'd say a good bet is his internal polling shows that he's in deep do-do and would get
slaughtered at the ballot box in any outing in the near future.



Wait, you say? Is it fair to say Huey has flip-flopped on an election call? Perhaps the Maples
stuff came to light since the last time he publicly dared the Premier to call an election and he
didn't know about the Maples issue, such as it is, back then.



Nah, no dice.



Lamoureux raised the issue more than a week before in the House on November 22 and Mia Rabson
wrote about the allegations in the next day's paper (as Kevvie so kindly documents ), noting
the matter was already under investigation by Elections Manitoba.



Now we don't know whether the Premier will call an election soon or not. But with the opposition
so willing to show their chicken feathers, we wonder if this might help Mr. Doer's decision
process.



-----------------------



From the file called: Not Only Does The Media Have No Long-Term Memory, Their Short-Term Ain't
Too Hot Neither.



The CBC Manitoba web story about the above affair today begins with the following:



"The NDP government publicly acknowledged on Tuesday that Elections Manitoba is
investigating allegations of wrongdoing by party members..."



Well, duh. The Premier's office sent it to Elections Manitoba for investigation as soon as it
received Kaur Sidhu's letter in September (about the time Lamoureux decided to sit on it).
This fact is actually mentioned later on in the story.



The idiocy goes further, though. The story carries the title "Elections Manitoba
investigates alleged NDP misconduct."



Double duh. That was public back in November.



Wonder whether that fits the CBC's standards for journalism?



Here's an excerpt from the foreword to its handbook of Journalistic Standards and Practices:
"It [the CBC] has established a reputation for rigorous and courageous journalistic
programs, the excellence of which is recognized worldwide."



Hmm. Rigorous and courageous, eh?



But perhaps we shouldn't be too hard on the denizens of 541 Portage Avenue, as here's what they
would find if they looked for further guidance from the Mother Ship's website to try and find
out exactly what those Journalistic Standards and Practices are.



-----------------------------------------------



After beating up on them, we change pace to simply say: Janet Stewart? Yes. Thumbs up.
(Beauregard ... eh, not so sure.)



------------------------------------------------



Thanks to our correspondents again for this tip:



Long-time mainstay of Osborne Village, Basil Lagopoulos, is putting his well-known
restaurant Basil's on the sale block, for a cool $1.5 million . Good luck, sir.



---------------------------------------------------



UPDATE: We note over the morning jo that the only print take-up on the Tory/Liberal laugh-fest
was a story by Mia Rabson that got "Web Extra" treatment (in the old days, that simply meant it
got the spike). Mia also largely ignored the Maples angle but focused on Tory complaints on how
Elections Manitoba operates. (The Tories got more jam out of complaining that a Wheat Board
referendum ballot got to a cattle rancher.) Either the Maples "issue" is boring even to the leg
watchers, or the potential trouble with upcoming legal action outweighs any minor
newsworthiness of the opposition's lame stunt. (Or perhaps a bit of both.) Just so this issue
isn't forgotten, though, we'll link to the press release stemming from the chicken suit
outing, noting we can only find it on the Liberals' site not on the PCs'. Email This BlogThis!

Odds and sods ...

Today we see Brodbeck do an absolutely fawning requiem for Vic Toews's mercifully short stint
as justice minister. It is absolutely over-the-top in burnishing the Vicster's rep and
blaming others for the guy's missteps.



Check this out:



"Making major changes to the Criminal Code is no easy feat, especially when those changes run
afoul of the political ideologies of senior bureaucrats...Try telling senior justice
officials that what they’ve been doing for the past 13 years, like allowing killers to get
house arrest, was the wrong thing to do and that you want to change it... They don’t like it
very much. And because politicians are vulnerable to the far-reaching powers of senior
bureaucrats, it’s easy for senior officials to sabotage the efforts of any minister."



Could you imagine Tom saying the same about ANY minister in, say, the Doer government? That
they in fact were not responsible for problems, but in fact it was the fault of entrenched and
powerful senior bureaucrats?



Actually, Tom has argued strongly for a very narrow version of ministerial responsibility in
the past, including taking aim at Gomery's excusing of Paul Martin in Adscam on the exact same
basis Tom now uses to excuse Vic's failures.



Ah, well. We suppose it all depends what team is up at bat.



--------



Bunkbeck's most recent attack on government advertising involves his taking umbrage with
the "Manitoba Means Business" campaign, claiming our province is pretty much in the crapper,
business-wise, therefore the advertising is dishonest, says Tom.



Interesting, though, the lead business story in Saturday's 'Peg Sun is how Winnipeg's real
estate market keeps on breaking records and the supply can't keep up with demand. Curious how
that can happen in a weak economy, eh?



And in his best 1984/War is Peace, writing style, our Tom attacks employment growth in
Manitoba, demanding why it is not as red-hot as Alberta's -- ignoring that Manitoba still has
statistical full employment, as it has for the past several years under the NDP, now down to
4.1%.



Manitoba employers can't hire enough people. Everyone knows that. (Again, funny how that
could possibly be the case in a weak economy.)



Well, maybe everyone know this except our erstwhile Sun scribbler.



It must be said, Tom has become a cartoon character of a right-wing columnist -- a bit of a
self-parody like Gordon Sinclair or Lindor Reynolds.



--------



Very interesting stuff emerging about Sam Katz's hero, Rudy Giuliani -- who of course came
here last February during the City Summit to wax eloquent about his crime fighting efforts as
mayor of New York. Since then, Katz has been pushing to adopt the CompStat computer system
Giuliani claims helped reduce crime by 60% in NYC in the 1990s. Critics say CompStat is more
gimmick and make-work project than an effective crime-busting tool.



However, apparently Giuliani's campaign team's greatest worry in their manoeuvering
towards the 2008 presidential race is his many business dealings since leaving the mayor's
chair, including lending his name to big coal, big nuke and big pharma -- which has apparently
made Rudy very wealthy in the past few years, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.



We wonder if CompStat will seem as sexy to Sam if Rudy turns into a political non-starter?
