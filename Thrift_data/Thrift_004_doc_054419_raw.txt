** Rio Ave ganhou por 2-1 nos penalties

AtlÃ©tico de Valdevez ficou isento.

ComentÃ¡rios: Para alÃ©m dos magros resultados obtidos pelos grandes com Benfica e
Sporting a nÃ£o disfarÃ§arem a crise. Ainda assim o Sporting conseguiu o resultado mais
dilatado da eliminatÃ³ria 4-0frente ao Lagoa, igual ao triunfo do PaÃ§os de Ferreira
frente ao Abrantes. O destaque tem de ir direitinho para o Sertanense Ãºnica equipa da
terceira divisÃ£o em prova que foi eliminar o Penafiel, em casa deste, da DivisÃ£o de
Honra.

TambÃ©m o Moreirense da II DivisÃ£o bateu uma equipa do escalÃ£o superior o Beira Mar da
DivisÃ£o de Honra. Para alÃ©m destes dois triunfos forasteiros apenas o MarÃ­timo
ganhou fora em Oliveira de AzemÃ©is.

Destaque ainda para o triunfo claro da Naval frente ao Boavista e para a derrota do Braga a
Amadora.

Os jogos da sexta eliminatÃ³ria estÃ£o aprazados para 10 de Fevereiro.   Deixa um

Jan 20: Remembering unforgettable actresses died on this day

Filed under: Audrey Hepurn , Barbara Stanwick — looking4good @ 5:26 pm

Barbara Stanwick dies at her home in Santa Monica, California on Jan 29, 1990 (born in New York
City on July 16, 1907). American actress. Stanwyck starred in almost a hundred films during
her career and received four nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress : Stella
Dallas (1937), Ball of Fire (1941), Double Indemnity (1944), and Sorry, Wrong Number (1948).
In her best films (such as The Lady Eve ) she often mixed a worldly toughness (a husky voice, an
earthy sense of humor) with heartbreaking vulnerability, particularly in her early
Pre-Code films.
