i / Ëˆ Éª n d i É™ / ), officially the Republic of India ( Hindi :
à€­à€Ÿà€°à€€ à€—à€£à€°à€Ÿà€œà¥�à€¯
BhÄ�rat Gaá¹‡arÄ�jya ; see also official names of India ), is a country in South
Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by geographical area, the second-most populous
country with over 1.2 billion people , and the most populous democracy in the world. [16]
Mainland India is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the west, and the
Bay of Bengal on the east; and it is bordered by Pakistan to the west; [note 1] Bhutan , the
People’s Republic of China and Nepal to the north; and Bangladesh and Burma to the east. In
the Indian Ocean, mainland India and the Lakshadweep Islands are in the vicinity of Sri Lanka
and the Maldives , while India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands share maritime border with
Thailand and the Indonesian island of Sumatra in the Andaman Sea . [17] India has a coastline of
7,517Â kilometres (4,700 mi). [18]

Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast
empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for
much of its long history. [19] Four of the world’s major religionsâ€” Hinduism ,
Buddhism , Jainism and Sikhism â€”originated here, while Zoroastrianism , Judaism ,
Christianity and Islam arrived in the first millennium CE and shaped the region’s diverse
culture . Gradually annexed by the British East India Company from the early 18th century and
colonised by the United Kingdom from the mid-19th century, India became an independent
nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence which was marked by a non-violent resistance
led by Mahatma Gandhi .

India is a federal constitutional republic with a parliamentary democracy consisting of 28
states and seven union territories . A pluralistic , multilingual and multiethnic society
where more than 300 [20] languages are spoken, India is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a
variety of protected habitats . The Indian economy is the world’s eleventh largest economy
by nominal GDP and the fourth largest by purchasing power parity . Since the introduction of
market-based economic reforms in 1991, India has become one of the fastest growing major
economies in the world; [21] however, the country continues to face several poverty ,
illiteracy , corruption and public health related challenges. India is classified as a newly
industrialised country and is one of the four BRIC nations. [22] [23] It is the world’s sixth
de facto recognized nuclear weapons state and has the third-largest standing armed force in
the world, while its military expenditure ranks tenth in the world. [24] India is a regional
power in South Asia. [25]

It is a founding member of the United Nations , the Non-Aligned Movement , the World Trade
Organization , the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation , the East Asia Summit ,
the G20 and the G8+5 ; a member of the Commonwealth of Nations ; and an observer state in the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation .

Etymology

Main article: Names of India

The name India is derived from Indus , which is derived from the Old Persian word Hindu , from
Sanskrit à€žà€¿à€šà¥�à€§à¥� Sindhu , the historic local
appellation for the Indus River . [26] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi
(Î™ÎœÎŽÎ¿Î¯), the people of the Indus. [27] The Constitution of India and common
usage in various Indian languages also recognise Bharat (pronounced
[ËˆbÊ±aË�rÉ™tÌª] (

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg/13px-Speaker_Icon.svg.png
listen )) as an official name of equal status. [28] The name Bharat is derived from the name of
the legendary king Bharata in Hindu scriptures. Hindustan (
[ÉŠÉªndÌªÊŠËˆstÌªaË�n] (

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg/13px-Speaker_Icon.svg.png
listen )), originally a Persian word for â€œLand of the Hindusâ€� referring to
northern India , is also occasionally used as a synonym for all of India. [29]

History

Main articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India

Stone Age rock shelters with paintings at the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh are
the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements
appeared about 8,500 years ago and gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation ,
[30] dating back to 3400Â  BCE in western India. It was followed by the Vedic period , which
laid the foundations of Hinduism and other cultural aspects of early Indian society, and
ended in the 500s BCE. From around 550Â BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known
as the Mahajanapadas were established across the country. [31]

Paintings at the Ajanta Caves in Aurangabad , Maharashtra , 6th century

In the 3rd centuryÂ BCE, most of South Asia was united into the Maurya Empire by
Chandragupta Maurya and flourished under Ashoka the Great . [32] From the 3rd century CE, the
Gupta dynasty oversaw the period referred to as ancient “ India’s Golden Age “. [33]
[34] Empires in southern India included those of the Chalukyas , the Cholas and the
Vijayanagara Empire . Science, technology , engineering , art , logic , language , literature
, mathematics , astronomy , religion and philosophy flourished under the patronage of these
kings.

Following Islamic invasions from Central Asia between the 10th and 12th centuries, much of
northern India came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire . Under
the rule of Akbar the Great , India enjoyed much cultural and economic progress as well as
religious harmony. [35] [36] Mughal emperors gradually expanded their empires to cover
large parts of the subcontinent. However, in northeastern India , the dominant power was the
Ahom kingdom of Assam , among the few kingdoms to have resisted Mughal subjugation. The first
major threat to Mughal imperial power came from a Hindu Rajput king Maha Rana Pratap of Mewar in
the 16th century. By early 1700s, the Sikh Empire and the Marathas had emerged as formidable
foes of the Mughals. [37] Following the death of Aurangzeb , the Mughal Empire entered a period
of gradual decline and by mid-18th century, a large portion of the Mughal territory came under
the control of the Hindu Maratha Empire . [38]

From the 16th century, European powers such as Portugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, France,
and Great Britain established trading posts and later took advantage of internal conflicts
to establish colonies in the country . By 1856, most of India was under the control of the
British East India Company . [39] A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling
military units and kingdoms, known as India’s First War of Independence or the Sepoy Mutiny
, seriously challenged the Company’s control but eventually failed. As a result of the
instability, India was brought under the direct rule of the British Crown .

Mahatma Gandhi (right) with Jawaharlal Nehru , 1937. Nehru would go on to become India’s
first prime minister in 1947.

In the 20th century, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian
National Congress (INC) and other political organisations. [40] Several Indian radical
revolutionaries, such as Subhash Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh , led armed rebellions
against the British Raj. [41] However, the defining aspect of the Indian independence
movement was the nonviolent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi and the INC. [42] Under the
leadership of Gandhi, millions of Indians participated in the Quit India civil disobedience
movement against the British Raj. [43]

In September 1939, India declared war on Germany and at the height of the World War II , more than
2.5 million Indian soldiers were fighting against the Axis powers . [44] The Indian Army was
one of the largest Allied forces contingents which took part in the North and East African ,
Western Desert and the Italian Campaign and played a crucial role in halting the progress of
Imperial Japan in the South-East Asian theatre . [45] [46] However, certain Indian
nationalists collaborated with the Axis powers to overthrow the British Raj. The Indian
National Army (INA), led by Bose, forged an alliance with the Axis powers and fought an
unsuccessful military campaign against British India. [47]

In 1943, a perceived shortage of food leading to large-scale hoarding and soaring food prices
coupled with poor food distribution mechanism and inadequate response of the British
officials resulted in a catastrophic famine in the Bengal region which killed about 1.5 to 3
million people. [48] [49] After World War II, a number of mutinies broke out in the Air Force and
Navy and the INA trials caused considerable public unrest. [50] [51] On 15 August 1947, the
British Raj was dissolved following which the Muslim-majority areas were partitioned which
led to the creation of a separate sovereign dominion known as Pakistan . [52] The partition led
to a population transfer of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the
death of about one million people. [53] On 26 January 1950, India became a republic and a new
constitution came into effect under which the country was established as a secular and a
democratic state. [54]

Soon after the end of the British Raj, the accession of the 552 princely states to the Union of
India went smoothly with the exception of Junagadh , Kashmir and Hyderabad . [55] Junagadh
acceded to Pakistan which caused considerable internal unrest. [56] As a consequence, India
militarily occupied Junagadh and held a plebiscite, following which Junagadh joined India .
[57] After negotiations between India and then Nizam of Hyderabad ended in a stalemate, India
launched a successful “ police action ” to annex Hyderabad. [57] In October 1947,
Pakistan attempted to militarily occupy Kashmir which caused the then Maharaja of Kashmir to
seek military assistance from India and signed the Instrument of Accession . [57] The armed
conflict between India and Pakistan ended in December 1948 and the Line of Control formed the
de facto border between Indian and Pakistani Kashmir. [58] India launched a successful
military campaign in 1961 to liberate Goa from Portuguese rule , following which Goa was
incorporated into the Indian union. [59] In 1962, India’s unresolved territorial
disputes with the People’s Republic of China escalated into the Sino-Indian War , after
which India lost control over northeastern Ladakh region. During the early 1970s, Sikkim
faced a popular pro-democratic movement and a referendum was held in 1975, following which
Sikkim merged with India. [60]

Since independence, India has faced challenges from religious violence , casteism ,
naxalism , terrorism and regional separatist insurgencies, especially in Jammu and Kashmir
and northeastern region. India is a state armed with nuclear weapons ; having conducted its
first nuclear test in 1974, [61] followed by another five tests in 1998. [61] From the 1950s to
the 1980s, India followed socialist -inspired policies. The economy was shackled by
extensive regulation , protectionism and public ownership, leading to pervasive
corruption and slow economic growth. [62] Beginning 1991, significant economic reforms
[63] have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,
increasing its global clout. [21]

Topographic map of India.

The territory controlled by India, the major portion of the Indian subcontinent, lies
between latitudes 6Â° and 36Â° N , and longitudes 68Â° and 98Â° E . The country sits
atop the Indian tectonic plate , a minor plate within the Indo-Australian Plate . [64]

India’s defining geological processes commenced seventy-five million years ago, when
the Indian subcontinent, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana , began a
northeastwards drift â€”lasting fifty million yearsâ€”across the then
unformed Indian Ocean. [64] The subcontinent’s subsequent collision with the Eurasian
Plate and subduction under it, gave rise to the Himalayas , the planet’s highest mountains,
which now abut India in the north and the north-east . [64] In the former seabed immediately
south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough , which, having
gradually been filled with river-borne sediment, [65] now forms the Indo-Gangetic Plain .
[66] To the west of this plain, and cut off from it by the Aravalli Range , lies the Thar Desert .
[67]

The original Indian plate now survives as peninsular India, the oldest and most geologically
stable part of India, and extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central
India. These parallel ranges run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the
coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east. [68] To their south, the remaining
peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau , is flanked on the left and right by the coastal
ranges, Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats respectively; [69] the plateau contains the oldest
rock formations in India, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India
lies to the north of the equator between 6Â°44′ and 35Â°30′ north latitude [70] and
68Â°7′ and 97Â°25′ east longitude. [71]

The Himalayas form the mountainous landscape of northern India. Seen here is Ladakh in Jammu
and Kashmir .

India’s coast is 7,517Â kilometres (4,700 mi) long; of this distance,
5,423Â kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India, and 2,094Â kilometres
(1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep Islands. [18] According to the Indian
naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coast consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches,
11% rocky coast including cliffs, and 46% mudflats or marshy coast. [18]

Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges
(Ganga) and the Brahmaputra , both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal . [72] Important
tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi , whose extremely low gradient
causes disastrous floods every year. Major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients
prevent their waters from flooding include the Godavari , the Mahanadi , the Kaveri , and the
Krishna , which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; [73] and the Narmada and the Tapti , which
drain into the Arabian Sea . [74] Among notable coastal features of India are the marshy Rann of
Kutch in western India, and the alluvial Sundarbans delta, which India shares with
Bangladesh. [75] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep , coral atolls off India’s
south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea
. [76]

Climate

Main article: Climate of India

India’s climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which
drive the monsoons . [77] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian Katabatic wind from
blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar
latitudes. [78] [79] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden
southwest summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of
India’s rainfall. [77] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet ,
tropical dry , subtropical humid , and montane . [80]

The Red Panda is found in the Himalayan foothills in northeastern India , particularly the
state of Sikkim. [81]

India, which lies within the Indomalaya ecozone , displays significant biodiversity . One of
the seventeen megadiverse countries , it is home to 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of all avian,
6.2% of all reptilian, 4.4% of all amphibian, 11.7% of all fish, and 6.0% of all flowering plant
species. [82] Many ecoregions , such as the shola forests , exhibit extremely high rates of
endemism ; overall, 33% of Indian plant species are endemic. [83] [84]

India’s forest cover ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands , Western
Ghats , and northeastern India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these
extremes lie the sal -dominated moist deciduous forest of eastern India; the teak -dominated
dry deciduous forest of central and southern India; and the babul -dominated thorn forest of
the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. [85] Important Indian trees include the
medicinal neem , widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies. The pipal fig tree, shown on the
seals of Mohenjo-daro , shaded Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment. According to
latest report, less than 12% of India’s landmass is covered by dense forests. [86]

Many Indian species are descendants of taxa originating in Gondwana, from which the Indian
plate separated. Peninsular India’s subsequent movement towards, and collision with,
the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic
changes 20 million years ago caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. [87] Soon
thereafter, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes on either
side of the emerging Himalaya. [85] Consequently, among Indian species, only 12.6% of
mammals and 4.5% of birds are endemic, contrasting with 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of
amphibians. [82] Notable endemics are the Nilgiri leaf monkey and the brown and carmine
Beddome’s toad of the Western Ghats. India contains 172, or 2.9%, of IUCN -designated
threatened species . [88] These include the Asiatic Lion , the Bengal Tiger , and the Indian
white-rumped vulture , which suffered a near-extinction from ingesting the carrion of
diclofenac -treated cattle.

In recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to India’s wildlife; in response,
the system of national parks and protected areas , first established in 1935, was
substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act [89] and Project
Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat; in addition, the Forest Conservation Act [90] was
enacted in 1980. Along with more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries , India hosts
thirteen biosphere reserves , [91] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere
Reserves ; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention . [92]

The Secretariat Building , in New Delhi , houses key government offices.

India is the most populous democracy in the world. [16] [93] It is a parliamentary republic and
operates under a multi-party system . [94] There are six recognised national parties , such as
Indian National Congress (INC) and Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional
parties . [95] From 1950 to 1990, barring two brief periods, the INC enjoyed a parliamentary
majority. Since late 1980s, politics in India has been dominated mostly by the INC and the BJP;
[96] however, the emergence of several influential regional parties has often necessitated
the formation of multi-party coalition government . [97]

Within Indian political culture , the INC is considered centre-left or “liberal” and the
BJP is considered centre-right or “conservative”. The INC was out of power between 1977
and 1980, when the Janata Party won the election owing to public discontent with the state of
emergency declared by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi . In 1989, a Janata Dal -led
National Front coalition in alliance with the Left Front coalition won the elections but
managed to stay in power for only two years. [98] As the 1991 elections gave no political party a
majority, the INC formed a minority government under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and
was able to complete its five-year term. [99]

The years 1996â€“1998 were a period of turmoil in the federal government with several
short-lived alliances holding sway. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996, followed by
the United Front coalition that excluded both the BJP and the INC. In 1998, the BJP formed the
National Democratic Alliance (NDA) with several other parties and became the first
non-Congress government to complete a full five-year term. [100]

In the 2004 Indian elections , the INC won the largest number of Lok Sabha seats and formed a
government with a coalition called the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), supported by
various Left-leaning parties and members opposed to the BJP. The UPA again came into power in
the 2009 general election ; however, the representation of the Left leaning parties within
the coalition has significantly reduced. [101] Manmohan Singh became the first prime
minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962 to be re-elected after completing a full five-year
term. [102]

India is a federation with a parliamentary form of government, governed under the
Constitution of India . [105] It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy ,
“in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law .” Federalism in
India defines the power distribution between the centre and the states . The government is
regulated by a checks and balances defined by Indian Constitution, which serves as the
country’s supreme legal document.

The Constitution of India came into force on 26 January 1950. [106] The preamble of the
constitution defines India as a sovereign , socialist , secular , democratic republic . [107]
India has a bicameral parliament operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary
system. Its form of government was traditionally described as being ‘quasi-federal’
with a strong centre and weaker states, [108] but it has grown increasingly federal since the
late 1990s as a result of political, economic and social changes. [109]

The President of India is the head of state [110] elected indirectly by an electoral college
[111] for a five-year term. [112] [113] The Prime Minister is the head of government and
exercises most executive power . [110] Appointed by the President, [114] the Prime Minister
is by convention supported by the party or political alliance holding the majority of seats in
the lower house of Parliament. [110] The executive branch consists of the President,
Vice-President, and the Council of Ministers (the Cabinet being its executive committee)
headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house
of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the
legislature, with the Prime Minister and his Council being directly responsible to the lower
house of the Parliament. [115]

The Legislature of India is the bicameral Parliament , which consists of the upper house
called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of
People). [116] The Rajya Sabha, a permanent body, has 245 members serving staggered six year
terms. [117] Most are elected indirectly by the state and territorial legislatures in
proportion to the state’s population. [117] 543 of the Lok Sabha’s 545 members are
directly elected by popular vote to represent individual constituencies for five year
terms. [117] The other two members are nominated by the President from the Anglo-Indian
community if the President is of the opinion that the community is not adequately
represented. [117]

Judiciary



India has a unitary three-tier judiciary, consisting of the Supreme Court , headed by the
Chief Justice of India , 21 High Courts , and a large number of trial courts. [118] The Supreme
Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes
between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts. [119] It is
judicially independent , [118] and has the power to declare the law and to strike down Union or
State laws which contravene the Constitution. [120] The role as the ultimate interpreter of
the Constitution is one of the most important functions of the Supreme Court. [121]

Administrative divisions

Main article: Administrative divisions of India

India consists of 28 states and seven Union Territories . [122] All states, and the two union
territories of Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi , have elected
legislatures and governments patterned on the Westminster model. The other five union
territories are directly ruled by the Centre through appointed administrators. In 1956,
under the States Reorganisation Act , states were formed on a linguistic basis. [123] Since
then, this structure has remained largely unchanged. Each state or union territory is
further divided into administrative districts . [124] The districts in turn are further
divided into tehsils and eventually into villages.

India and Russia share an extensive economic, defence and technological relationship .
[125] Shown here is PM Manmohan Singh with President Dmitry Medvedev at the 34th G8 Summit .

Since its independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relationships with most
nations. In the 1950s, it strongly advocated for the independence of European colonies in
Africa and Asia and played a pioneering role in the Non-Aligned Movement . [126] [127] India
was involved in two brief military interventions in neighbouring countriesÂ â€“
the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka and Operation Cactus in Maldives. India has a tense
relationship with neighbouring Pakistan and the two countries went to war in 1947 and 1965
over the Kashmir dispute . After the Sino-Indian War and the 1965 war, India’s relationship
with the Soviet Union warmed and continued to remain so until the end of the Cold War . In 1971, a
third major war broke out between India and Pakistan which resulted in a decisive Indian
victory and the creation of Bangladesh . [128] Additional skirmishes have taken place
between the two nations over the disputed Siachen Glacier . In 1999, India and Pakistan fought
an undeclared war over the Kargil district .

In recent years, India has played an influential role in the SAARC and the WTO . [129] India has
provided as many as 55,000 Indian military and police personnel to serve in thirty-five UN
peacekeeping operations across four continents. [130] India is also an active participant
in various multilateral forums, particularly the East Asia Summit and the G8+5 . [131] [132]
In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations in South
America, Asia and Africa.

India maintains close defence cooperation with Russia , Israel and France , who are the chief
suppliers of arms. Recent overtures by the Indian government have enhanced India’s
economic, strategic and military cooperation with the United States and the European Union .
[133] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement between India and the United States was signed,
prior to which India received waivers from the IAEA and the NSG which ended restrictions on
nuclear technology commerce, even though India possesses nuclear weapons and is not a
signatory of the NPT . As a consequence, India became the world’s sixth de facto recognized
nuclear weapons state . [134] Following the NSG waiver, India has also signed civilian
nuclear energy cooperation agreements with other nations including Russia, [135] France,
[136] the United Kingdom , [137] and Canada . [138]

Jointly developed by Sukhoi and Hindustan Aeronautics , the Su-30 MKI “Flanker-H” is the
Indian Air Force ‘s prime air superiority fighter . [139]

India maintains the third-largest military force in the world , which consists of the Indian
Army , Navy , Air Force and auxiliary forces such as the Paramilitary Forces , the Coast Guard ,
and the Strategic Forces Command . [54] The official Indian defence budget for 2010 stood at
US$31.9 billion (or 2.12% of GDP). [140] According to a 2008 SIPRI report, India’s annual
military expenditure in terms of PPP stood at US$72.7 billion. [141] The President of India is
the supreme commander of the Indian Armed Forces. Defence contractors, such as the Defence
Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), oversee
indigenous development of sophisticated arms and military equipment, including ballistic
missiles, fighter aircraft and main battle tanks, to reduce India’s dependence on foreign
imports.

China’s repeated threats to intervene in the 1965 war in support of Pakistan convinced
India to develop nuclear weapons to counter Chinese nuclear tests . [142] India conducted its
first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out further underground testing in 1998.
Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has consistently refused to sign the CTBT
and the NPT which it considers to be flawed and discriminatory. [143] India maintains a “ no
first use ” nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its “
minimum credible deterrence ” doctrine. [144] [145] India also has an advanced ballistic
missile defence shield development program and is developing a fifth generation fighter jet
in collaboration with Russia. [146] [147] Other major indigenous military development
projects include Vikrant class aircraft carriers and Arihant class nuclear submarines .

The Bombay Stock Exchange , in Mumbai , is Asia’s oldest and India’s largest stock
exchange by market capitalisation .

According to the International Monetary Fund , India’s nominal GDP stood at US$1.3
trillion, which makes it the eleventh-largest economy in the world, [150] corresponding to a
per capita income of US$1,000. [151] If purchasing power parity (PPP) is taken into account,
India’s economy is the fourth largest in the world at US$3.6 trillion. [152] The country
ranks 142th in nominal GDP per capita and 127th in GDP per capita at PPP . [150] With an average
annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% for the past two decades, India is one of the fastest growing
economies in the world . [153]

Before 1991, the Indian government followed protectionist and socialist -inspired
policies because of which the Indian economy was largely closed to the outside world and
suffered from extensive state intervention and regulation . [154] After an acute balance of
payments crisis , the nation liberalised its economy and has since moved towards a
free-market economy . [155] [156] Since then, the emphasis has been to use foreign trade and
investment as integral parts of India’s economy. [157] Currently, India’s economic
system is portrayed as a capitalist model with the influx of private enterprise. [156]

India has the world’s second largest labour force , with 467 million people. [158] In terms
of output, the agricultural sector accounts for 28% of GDP; the service and industrial
sectors make up 54% and 18% respectively. Major agricultural products include rice, wheat,
oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, potatoes. [122] Major industries include textiles,
telecommunications, chemicals, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement,
mining, petroleum, machinery and software. [122] India’s external trade has reached a
relatively moderate share of 24% of GDP in 2006, up from 6% in 1985. [155] In 2008, India’s
share of world trade was about 1.68%; [159] in 2009, it was the world’s fifteenth largest
importer and eighteenth largest exporter . [160] Major exports include petroleum products,
textile goods, gems and jewelry, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and leather
manufactures. [122] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser,
chemicals. [122]

Tata Nano , the world’s cheapest car. [161] India’s annual car exports have surged
fivefold in the past five years. [162]

During the late 2000s, India’s economic growth averaged 7.5% a year. [155] Over the past
decade , hourly wage rates in India have more than doubled. [163] According to a 2007 McKinsey
Global Institute report, since 1985, India’s robust economic growth has shifted 431
million Indians out of poverty and by 2030, India’s middle class population will rise to
more than 580 million people. [164] India ranks 51st in the Global Competitiveness Report and
if diversified, it ranked 16th in financial market sophistication, 24th in banking sector,
27th in business sophistication and 30th in innovation; ahead of several advanced
economies. [165] Seven of the world’s top 15 technology outsourcing companies are based in
India and the country is viewed as the second most favourable outsourcing destination after
the United States. [166] India’s consumer market is currently the world’s thirteenth
largest and is expected to become the fifth largest by 2030. [164] India has the world’s
fastest growing telecommunication industry , adding about 10 million subscribers during
2008â€“09 period. [167] The country has the world’s second fastest growing
automobile industry , with domestic sales increasing by 26% during the 2009â€“10
period [168] and exports increasing by 36% during the 2008â€“09 period. [169]

Despite India’s impressive economic growth over recent decades, it still contains the
largest concentration of poor people in the world. [170] The percentage of people living
below the World Bank ‘s international poverty line of $1.25 a day ( PPP , in nominal terms

14.3 in rural areas in 2005) decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005. [171] Since 1991,
inter-state economic inequality in India has consistently grown; the per capita net state
domestic product of India’s richest states is about 3.2 times that of the poorest states.
[172] Even though India has avoided famines in recent decades, half of children are
underweight [173] and about 46% of Indian children under the age of three suffer from
malnutrition . [170] [174] [175]

According to a 2011 PwC report, in terms of PPP, India’s GDP will overtake that of Japan in
2011 and by 2045, India’s GDP will surpass that of the United States. [176] Additionally,
over the next four decades, India’s average annual economic growth rate is expected to
stand at about 8% and therefore, it has the potential to be the world’s fastest growing major
economy over the period to 2050. [176] The report also highlighted some of the key factors
behind India’s high economic growth rate â€” young and rapidly growing working age
population; growth of manufacturing sector due to strong engineering skills and rising
levels of education; and sustained growth of consumer market due to rapidly growing middle
class population. [176] However, the World Bank suggests that for India to achieve its
economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport
infrastructure , agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations,
education , energy security , and public health and nutrition. [177]

Population density map of India.

With an estimated population of 1.2 billion, [10] India is the world’s second most populous
country. The last 50 years have seen a rapid increase in population due to medical advances and
massive increase in agricultural productivity due to the “ green revolution “. [178]
[179] The percentage of Indian population living in urban areas has consistently grown; from
1991 to 2001, India’s urban population increased by 31.2%. [180] In 2001, about 285 million
Indians lived in urban areas while more than 70% of India’s population resided in rural
areas. [181] [182] As per the 2001 census, there are twenty seven million-plus cities , [180]
with the largest cities being Mumbai , Delhi and Kolkata .

India’s literacy rate is 64.8% (53.7% for females and 75.3% for males). [54] The state of
Kerala has the highest literacy rate at 91% while Bihar has the lowest at 47%. [183] [184] The
national human sex ratio is 944 females per 1,000 males. India’s median age is 24.9, and the
population growth rate of 1.38% per annum; there are 22.01 births per 1,000 people per year.
[54] Though India has one of the world’s most diverse and modern healthcare systems, the
country continues to face several public health-related challenges. [185] [186] According
to the World Health Organization, 900,000 Indians die each year from drinking contaminated
water and breathing in polluted air. [187] There are about 60 physicians per 100,000 people in
India. [188]

Languages

Main article: Languages of India

India is home to two major linguistic families : Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the
population) and Dravidian (spoken by about 24%). Other languages spoken in India come from
the Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman linguistic families. Neither the Constitution of
India , nor any Indian law defines any national language . [8] Hindi, with the largest number of
speakers, [189] is the official language of the union . [190] English is used extensively in
business and administration and has the status of a ‘subsidiary official language;’
[191] it is also important in education , especially as a medium of higher education . In
addition, every state and union territory has its own official languages, and the
constitution also recognises in particular 21 “scheduled languages”.

Religion

Main article: Religion in India

As per the 2001 census, over 800 million Indians (80.5%) were Hindu . Other religious groups
include Muslims (13.4%), Christians (2.3%), Sikhs (1.9%), Buddhists (0.8%), Jains (0.4%),
Jews , Zoroastrians and BahÃ¡’Ã­s . [192] Tribals constitute 8.1% of the population.
[193] [ dead link ] India has the third-highest Muslim population in the world and has the
highest population of Muslims for a non- Muslim majority country .

Culture

The Taj Mahal in Agra was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial to his deceased wife
Mumtaz Mahal . It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site considered to be of “outstanding universal
value”. [194]

India’s culture is marked by a high degree of syncretism [195] and cultural pluralism.
[196] India’s cultural tradition dates back to 8000 BCE [197] and has a continuously
recorded history for over 2,500 years. [198] With its roots based in the Indus Valley
Tradition , the Indian culture took a distinctive shape during the 11th century BCE Vedic age
which laid the foundation of Hindu philosophy , mythology , literary tradition and beliefs
and practices, such as dhÃ¡rma , kÃ¡rma , yÃ³ga and moká¹£a . [199] It has managed to
preserve established traditions while absorbing new customs, traditions, and ideas from
invaders and immigrants and spreading its cultural influence to other parts of Asia, mainly
South East and East Asia .

Indian religions form one of the most defining aspects of Indian culture. [200] Major
dhÃ¡rmic religions which were founded in India include Hinduism , Buddhism and Jainism .
Considered to be a successor to the ancient Vedic religion , [201] Hinduism has been shaped by
the various schools of thoughts based on the Upanishads , [202] the Yoga Sutras and the Bhakti
movement . [200] Buddhism originated in India in 5th century BCE and prominent early Buddhist
schools, such as TheravÄ�da and MahÄ�yÄ�na , gained dominance during the Maurya
Empire . [200] Though Buddhism entered a period of gradual decline in India 5th century CE
onwards, [203] it played an influential role in shaping Indian philosophy and thought. [200]

Indian architecture is one area that represents the diversity of Indian culture. Much of it,
including notable monuments such as the Taj Mahal and other examples of Mughal architecture
and South Indian architecture , comprises a blend of ancient and varied local traditions from
several parts of the country and abroad. Vernacular architecture also displays notable
regional variation.

Considered to be the earliest and foremost “monument” of Indian literature , the Vedic or
Sanskrit literature was developed from 1,400 BCE to 1,200 AD. [204] [205] Prominent Indian
literary works of the classical era include epics such as MahÄ�bhÄ�rata and Ramayana ,
dramas such as the AbhijÃ±Ä�naÅ›Ä�kuntalam (The Recognition of
ÅšakuntalÄ�) , and poetry such as the MahÄ�kÄ�vya . [206] Developed between 600
BCE and 300 AD, the Sangam literature consists 2,381 poems and is regarded as a predecessor of
Tamil literature . [207] [208] [209] From 7th century AD to 18th century AD, India’s
literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of
devotional poets such as KabÄ«r , TulsÄ«dÄ�s and Guru NÄ�nak . This period was
characterized by varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression and as a consequence,
medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions. [210] In
the 19th century, Indian writers took new interest in social questions and psychological
descriptions. During the 20th century, Indian literature was heavily influenced by the
works of universally acclaimed Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore . [211]

Society and traditions

Image: http://bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png

The Swaminarayan movement is closely associated with the culture and the linguistic
traditions of the Gujarati people . [212] Shown here is the Swaminarayan Akshardham in Delhi ,
the world’s largest Hindu temple complex. [213]

Traditional Indian society is defined by relatively strict social hierarchy. The Indian
caste system describes the social stratification and social restrictions in the Indian
subcontinent, in which social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary
groups, often termed as jÄ�tis or castes . [214] Several influential social reform
movements, such as the Bramho ShÃŽmaj , the Arya SamÄ�ja and the Ramakrishna Mission ,
have played a pivotal role in the emancipation of Dalits (or “untouchables”) and other
lower-caste communities in India. [215] However, the majority of Dalits continue to live in
segregation and are often persecuted and discriminated against. [216]

Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and multi-generational
patriarchal joint families have been the norm, although nuclear families are becoming
common in urban areas. [62] An overwhelming majority of Indians have their marriages
arranged by their parents and other respected family members, with the consent of the bride
and groom. [217] Marriage is thought to be for life, [217] and the divorce rate is extremely
low. [218] Child marriage is still a common practice, more so in rural India, with half of women
in India marrying before the legal age of 18. [219] [220]

Many Indian festivals are religious in origin, although several are celebrated
irrespective of caste and creed. Some popular festivals are Diwali , Ganesh Chaturthi , Ugadi
, Thai Pongal , Holi , Onam , Vijayadashami , Durga Puja , Eid ul-Fitr , Bakr-Id , Christmas,
Buddha Jayanti , Moharram and Vaisakhi . [221] [222] India has three national holidays which
are observed in all states and union territories â€” Republic Day , Independence Day and
Gandhi Jayanthi . Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially
observed in individual states. Religious practices are an integral part of everyday life and
are a very public affair.

Traditional Indian dress varies across the regions in its colours and styles and depends on
various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as
sari for women and dhoti or lungi for men; in addition, stitched clothes such as salwar kameez
for women and kurta - pyjama and European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular.

Music, dance, theatre and cinema



Indian music covers a wide range of traditions and regional styles. Classical music largely
encompasses the two genresÂ â€“ North Indian Hindustani , South Indian Carnatic
traditions and their various offshoots in the form of regional folk music. Regionalised
forms of popular music include filmi and folk music ; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a
well-known form of the latter.

Indian dance too has diverse folk and classical forms. Among the well-known folk dances are
the bhangra of the Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the chhau of West Bengal , Jharkhand , sambalpuri
of Orissa , the ghoomar of Rajasthan and the Lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many
with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status

Theatre in India often incorporates music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue. [224]
Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances, and news of social
and political events, Indian theatre includes the bhavai of state of Gujarat, the jatra of
West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, the tamasha of Maharashtra, the
burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh, the terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.
[225]

The Indian film industry is the largest in the world. [226] Bollywood , based in Mumbai, makes
commercial Hindi films and is the most prolific film industry in the world. [227] Established
traditions also exist in Assamese , Bengali , Kannada , Malayalam , Marathi , Oriya , Tamil , and
Telugu language cinemas. [228]

Cuisine



Indian cuisine is characterised by a wide variety of regional styles and sophisticated use of
herbs and spices. The staple foods in the region are rice (especially in the south and the
east), wheat (predominantly in the north) [229] and lentils. [230] Spices , such as black
pepper which are now consumed world wide, are originally native to the Indian subcontinent.
Chili pepper , which was introduced by the Portuguese , is also widely used in Indian cuisine.

A 2008 Indian Premier League Twenty20 cricket match being played between the Chennai Super
Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders

India’s official national sport is field hockey , administered by Hockey India . The Indian
hockey team won the 1975 Hockey World Cup and 8 gold , 1 silver and 2 bronze medals at the Olympic
games, making it one of the world’s most successful national hockey teams ever. Cricket ,
however, is by far the most popular sport; [232] the India cricket team won the 1983 Cricket
World Cup , 2007 ICC World Twenty20 , and shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka .
Cricket in India is administered by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and
domestic competitions include the Ranji Trophy , the Duleep Trophy , the Deodhar Trophy , the
Irani Trophy and the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy . In addition, BCCI conducts the Indian
Premier League , a Twenty20 competition.

India is home to several traditional sports which originated in the country and continue to
remain fairly popular. These include kabaddi , kho kho , pehlwani and gilli-danda . Some of the
earliest forms of Asian martial arts , such as Kalarippayattu , Yuddha , Silambam and Varma
Kalai , originated in India. The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and the Arjuna Award are India’s
highest awards for achievements in sports, while the Dronacharya Award is awarded for
excellence in coaching.

Chess , commonly held to have originated in India , is regaining widespread popularity with
the rise in the number of Indian Grandmasters . [233] Tennis has also become increasingly
popular, owing to the victories of the India Davis Cup team and the success of Indian tennis
players . [234] India has a strong presence in shooting sports , winning several medals at the
Olympics, the World Shooting Championships and the Commonwealth Games. [235] [236] Other
sports in which Indian sports-persons have won numerous awards or medals at international
sporting events include badminton , [237] boxing [238] and wrestling . [239] [240] Football
is a popular sport in northeastern India , West Bengal , Goa , Tamil Nadu and Kerala . [241]

India has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events, such as the 1951 and the
1982 Asian Games , the 1987 and 1996 Cricket World Cup , the 2003 Afro-Asian Games , the 2010
Hockey World Cup and the 2010 Commonwealth Games . Major international sporting events
annually held in India include the Chennai Open , Mumbai Marathon , Delhi Half Marathon and the
Indian Masters . The country is scheduled to host the 2011 Cricket World Cup and the first
Indian Grand Prix in 2011.

Notes

    

    1 - ^ The Government of India also considers Afghanistan to be a bordering country. This is
    because it considers the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir to be a part of India including
    the portion bordering Afghanistan. A ceasefire sponsored by the United Nations in 1948
    froze the positions of Indian and Pakistani-held territory. As a consequence, the
    region bordering Afghanistan is in Pakistan-administered Kashmir .

    from literature written in classical (Indo-Aryan) Sanskrit, Tamil is the oldest
    literature in India. Some inscriptions on stone have been dated to the 3rd century BC, but
    Tamil literature proper begins around the 1st century AD. Much early poetry was
    religious or epic; an exception was the secular court poetry written by members of the
    sangam , or literary academy (see Sangam literature).” 2. Ramanujan 1985 ,
    pp.Â ixâ€“x. Quote : “These poems are ‘classical,’ i.e. early, ancient;
    they are also ‘classics,’ i.e. works that have stood the test of time, the founding
    works of a whole tradition. Not to know them is not to know a unique and major poetic
    achievement of Indian civilisation. Early classical Tamil literature (c. 100
    BCâ€“AD 250) consists of the Eight Anthologies ( EÅ£Å£uttokai ), the Ten Long
    Poems ( PattuppÄ�Å£Å£u ), and a grammar called the TolkÄ�ppiyam or the ‘Old
    Composition.’Â … The literature of classical Tamil later came to be known as
    Cankam (pronounced Sangam ) literature. (pp. ixâ€“x.)”

1995-1997



1995

    

    - Larry Page and Sergey Brin meet at Stanford. (Larry, 22, a U Michigan grad, is
    considering the school; Sergey, 21, is assigned to show him around.) According to some
    accounts, they disagree about most everything during this first meeting.

    



1996

    

    - Larry and Sergey, now Stanford computer science grad students, begin collaborating on
    a search engine called BackRub .

1997

    

    - Larry and Sergey decide that the BackRub search engine needs a new name. After some
    brainstorming, they go with Google â€”a play on the word â€œgoogol,â€� a
    mathematical term for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros. The
    use of the term reflects their mission to organize a seemingly infinite amount of
    information on the web.
