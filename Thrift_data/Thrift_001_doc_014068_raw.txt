The Welch Way.



February 27, 2012 Leave a comment

Jack Welch during his tenure at GE , always carried a laminated plastic card that read out the
Vision Statement and defined the Core Objectives of every Employees, as:

    GE leaders, always with underlying integrity:

    - Create a clear, simple, reality based customer-focused vision, and are able to
    communicate it straightforwardly to all constituencies.

    

    - Reach, set aggressive targets, recognize and reward progress, while
    understandingÂ accountability andÂ commitment.

    

    - Have a passion for excellence, hate bureaucracy, and all theÂ nonsenseÂ that
    comes with it.

    

    - Have a self-confidenceÂ to empower others, and behave in a boundaryless fashion,
    believe in and are committed to workout as a means of empowerment, and are open to ideas
    from everywhere.

    

    - Have, or have the capacity to develop, global brains and global sensitivity, and
    areÂ comfortable building diverse and global teams.

    

    - Have enormous energy and the ability
    toÂ energizeÂ andÂ invigorateÂ others, stimulate and relish change, and
    not be frightened or paralyzed by it, se change as an opportunity, not a threat.

    

    - Possess a mind-set that drives quality, cost and speed for a competitive advantage.

    





Image: http://amitnsingh.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/jack-welch1.jpg?w=630 In one
of his legendary statements, he quotes, “The job of theÂ EnterpriseÂ is to provide an
exiting atmosphere that’s open and fair, where people have the resources to go out and win.
The job of the people is to take advantage of this playing field and put out 110 percent”. He
playfully reinvented an old company with outdated values intoÂ a company with as many
workers as Akron, Ohio has residents; and with revenues larger than the gross domestic
product of more than half the nations of the world. Today, he is considered among the Top 50
Thinkers of world and the person behind widely used jargon like – MBO (Management by
Objective), SBU (Strategic Business Unit), Bullet Train (GE’s approach to change), Smart
Bombing, Strategic Planning, SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities &
Threats), TPC (Analysis of business issues in Technical, Political & Cultural terms) ,
Downsizing, Â Rightsizing, Restructuring, Rationalization etc. In 1999, right before
his official retirement, he was named as the “ Manager of the Century ” and is certainly the
best Mergers & Acquisition expert, with whom we can learn a lot from. In his regime, GE
witnessed more than 1000 acquisition, which averages out to more than 2 per month. He was also
voted the “ Most Respected CEO ” in Industry Week survey and Business week proclaimed him
to be “ The Golden Standard against which other CEOs are measured “. He definitely
installed a new set of cultures which redefined the way people practice business today.

The Human Connection.



January 9, 2012 Leave a comment

No democracy has ever produced anything monumental. To come up with any timeless products,
services or ideas; it has to be based on utter dedication, discipline, passion, perfection
and elegance. No matter whatever may be the nature of business, it should firmly be founded on
simplifying others lives and connecting with people. If we trace our past, itâ€™s the
art which always made people weak at the knees. And to create something monumental of that
order, there have always been some insanely passionate and dedicated group of people behind
the scenes. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever had changed the world!!!



When we dig deeper and examine the trends, people are always in search of breathtaking
moments. Itâ€™s these moments, which make people life-long fans and induce them with
loyalty to any particular brand, product or experiences. Be it a handheld device or
mega-machine; itâ€™s the craftsmanship and experience it creates, which fascinates
people. No matter how sophisticated business processes one may use and how integrated
business model it may be; if it doesnâ€™t have the sense of human connection, it is bound
to experience some turbulences.

Elegance has no substitute. If we look into the psychology behind people visiting Colosseum
in Rome, Hagia Sophia in Turkey, Taj Mahal in India or Machu Picchu in Peru; people travel long
distances and spend huge sums just for the sake of sensation it creates over the mind. All these
grand architectures would not have existed without a great vision, concentrated efforts and
sincere dedication. They all stood against time, and created those masterpieces which stand
tall even today, winning over the hearts of millions of people. Now, if we manage to replicate
the same sensation through our products and services, our work is done!!!!

There are no shortcuts to excellence. To come up with a timeless products, we need people who
are ready to burn their souls, collectively concentrate their minds to illuminate the
products & services; and enrich the user experience. By introducing fraternity, richer
interactions and cultivating profound sense of mission, we are likely to see stronger bonds
between brand, employees, customers, networks and mission. By sticking to the idea of
over-delivering values andÂ developing insanely greatÂ myriad products, we can
ultimatelyÂ grow our companies into powerhouses.

At a much higher level itâ€™s the emotion which acts as a binding force between the
elements of our human civilization. Different elements interact with each other at varied
intensities. Accordingly, success in both Life and Business depends on how well a group of
people or individuals respond to their emotional urges. Â In case of Individuals, the
control over their emotions identifies and defines the quality of life a person leads. If an
individual has full control over their mind and emotions, he/she can have the best quality of
life one can ever imagine. On the other hand, as we all know, most of the people are already busy
with their quest to search happiness and seek the meaning of life.Â If an individual has
full control over their mind, he can not only gain a privileged access toÂ a
non-exhaustible source of happiness, but also gains full authority over their own life and
future. Yes, life can be controlled and future can be predicted through careful choices over
the timeline!!!

Mostly people see the world and situations in accordance with the orientation of their
thought process and their core values. Every individual have a personalized glass through
which they see the world. In reality, the world is much more dynamic and different from the one
seen through glasses. Moreover, individuals donâ€™t have a clue about the thing they
donâ€™t know and are found to be slave of their own emotions. People feel troubled only
when they are in need of ideas and concepts which they had been avoiding altogether. All these
roadblocks, problems, challenges and fear; they are just a state of mind and donâ€™t
exist in reality. People tame these attributes of their own choice and restrict themselves
from further fulfillment.Â Additionally, lack of ‘Will Power’ is just another
mental disease. People fail to understand that overcoming fear is the only way out and also the
first step towards success. Roadblocks are placed as a measure to determine, how badly an
individual wants to achieve their goal and as a measure to calibrate their passion in
accordance with the minimumÂ enthusiasm required to achieve that goal.

http://amitnsingh.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/realbollywood.jpg?w=300&h=200 If we
take the world as a closed system, its net development depends on the vectored sum of
individual orientations and motivations. Still, the world keeps moving ahead and
doesnâ€™t wait for anyone. Itâ€™s just that,Â the gap between the top-line
(those with control over mind and emotions, possess laser sharp focus and obviously
successful people) and bottom-line (complex, sufferers and emotional people) keeps
increasing, andÂ these bottom-liners become victim of their own unintelligent choices.
These people can be considered as being trapped in a marshy land, amid thick forest along with
their peers and cannot expect any relief unless they are ready to support during their rescue
operation and ready to tolerate the pain involved in that process. But these Top-liners are
the self-actuated person whoÂ have full control over their mind andÂ stand high over a
mountain top who see the world clearly and as it is. Their visions are clear and are free from all
non value adding concepts which can ever avert them from attaining their fundamental goal.
All the chaos lies mostly around the bottom-line and as one move vertically along the social
setup; one can see a diminishing chaos towards the top. This can be understood as a drive from a
forest to a mountain cliff – Â as one keep gaining altitude, the view becomes clearer and
even the horizon expands.

World is full of people who are unhappy with their job and their life. The reason behind is
â€“ either they are at a wrong job, their inefficient past haunts their present or fail to
establish a work-life balance. Everyone always have all the options open to establish an
ideal life; given they are willing to work towards it. Instead of being an asset, such person
turns out to be burden on any organization. One or the other day such people surely quit the job
leaving the organization in a lurch. Most of the companies fail just because either the
company was founded without necessary planning or if wrong set of people were hired. To have a
sustainable future, only those people must be hired at key positions who have a full control
over their mind and emotions. They are well armed with insights which helps in the developing a
positive ecosystem at work-place, bring down bureaucracy and thus drive the organization
towards excellence. Without a healthy work environment any organization can never be driven
towards sustainability and a promising future.

It is the emotions which governs the idea generation process.Â Emotion creates ups and
downs, inconsistency and hosts an environment which supports office politics and
bureaucracy.Â If an individual is emotionally healthy, all sorts of great and timely
ideas can be expected out of him, which is really important for the overall growth of the
company.Â Moreover, most successful companies are those which create values &
experience, design products and services around the unmet needs of people and have a sense of
condor at workplace. Every opportunity starts with an unmet need.

The proverb â€œwhat goes around comes back aroundâ€� holds true with
organizations too. First of all, the way the organizational head behaves with its employees,
he gets the same kind of return from its employees too. Secondly, success depends on the kind of
energy being directed to the market and clients. Returning back a favor is deeply rooted in
human behavior. If any organization helps in meeting the needs of its customer, itâ€™s
bound to get the return in the form of loyalty.

    In future, the success of the organization will depend on the rate at which they learn from
    surroundings. Today; be it products, services or processes; everything is copied and
    followed within months. Itâ€™s the learning behavior and agility which will
    provide an edge to organizations in future. And the self-atualized leaders will have a
    key role in it, as:

    - They can inevitably lead from the front and be the face of organization or movement.

    

    - They are ready to learn from each and every source.

    

    - They can set a tone for continuous learning and improvements inside the organization.

    

    - Build the climate, leadership behavior and contribute in a meaningful way.

    

    - Establishing positive ecosystem andÂ introduce concrete prescriptions.

    

    - They use their disciplined efforts toÂ work through resistance.

    

    - Overcoming inertia,Â solve conflicts and fuel forward momentum.

    

    - Carefully intertwined the long-term and short-term results to keep the employees
    motivated.

    

    - Build trust, simplicity and embrace values.

    

    - Focus on high impact activities and come up with startling results.

    

    - EstablishÂ passion, possibility, peace and aÂ culture of
    transparency,Â ownership and responsibility.

    

    - They mostly indulge into activities what others donâ€™t like doing or consider as
    a tough job.

    

    - Identifying opportunities, keep hold of ideas and run the values through the nerves of
    organization.

    

    - They respect time, its value as a non-renewable resource and understand the difference
    between time management and time mastery.

    



By understanding our employees, connecting with them and drafting policies for their career
& life development; we will not only get rid of the employee migration problem, but will all
host a positive work environment; which will lead way to profitability and organizational
excellence.
