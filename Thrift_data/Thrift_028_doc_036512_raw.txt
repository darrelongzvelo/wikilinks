This Day in Geek History: April 30



30 Apr 2009   Geek History



1006



Image: http://thegreatgeekmanual.com/images/geekhistory/april/supernova-1006.jpg
Supernova SN 1006 , the brightest supernova in recorded history, in the southern
constellation Lupus , near the star Beta Lupi . Chinese and Arabic astronomers note the
supernova, but the speed of the still-expanding shock wave won’t be measured for nearly a
millennium. It was also recorded by observers in Switzerland, Italy, Japan, Egypt, and Iraq.
From the careful descriptions of the Chinese astronomers of how the light varies, the
Supernova is apparently yellow in color and visible for over a year, possibly reaching a
magnitude of up -9.

1665

Samuel Pepys makes his first diary reference to the Great Plague in London . “Great fears of
the sicknesses here in the City, it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God
preserve us all.” The diary entries continue throughout the year, documenting the
terrible conditions in the city as many thousands die, until Winter’s freezing cold
reduces the number of fleas that spread the disease. The symptoms of the plague begin like
those of a bad cold. A high fever follows, with vomiting and painful black swellings, called
buboes appearing in the groin and under the armpits. His diaries will cover a period from
January 1660 to May 1669. In them, he will also write about the Great Fire of London in 1666.

1796

The first US patent for a pill of any kind is issued to Samuel Lee, Jr., of Connecticut, for a
“Composition of bilious pills” which he markets as “Lee’s Windham Pills.” The
pills are highly popular for a long period. An 1803 advertisement for “Doctor Lee’s
Patent New-London Bilious Pills” will describe them as “Interesting to all sea-faring
People” and promise to cure a variety of ills, including “foul stomachs, where pukes are
indicated.”



1878

Louis Pasteur lectures at the French Academy of Science in support of his germ theory of
disease, in which he holds that many diseases are caused by tiny organisms. Pasteur also
describes ways to prevent infection, and provides skeptics with an experiment with which to
prove the theory to themselves.

1883

The Edison Electric Illuminating Co. is incorporated. It will later build the first US
three-wire central station for incandescent lighting.

1897

At the Royal Institution Friday Evening Discourse, Joseph John Thomson first announces the
existence of what will later be known as electrons . Thomson tells the audience that earlier in
the year, he had made a surprising discovery. He had found a particle of matter a thousand times
smaller than the atom. He calls it a corpuscle, meaning “small body.” Although Thomson is
the director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and one of the most
respected scientists in Great Britain, the scientists present find the news difficult to
believe. They believe that the atom is the smallest and most indivisible part of matter that
could exist. Nevertheless, the electron is historically the first elementary particle to be
discovered.

1938

The cartoon short Porky’s Hare Hunt , debuts in movie theaters, introducing Bugs Bunny .

1939

Cosmic rays entering a Geiger-Mueller counter produce electrical impulses used to control
electrical power. This first ever such event, is used for the illumination ceremony of the
1939 New York World’s Fair. The counter, at the Hayden Planetarium in New York City,
switches on an electrical circuit wired to a display at the Lagoon of Nations where relays
activate local battery circuits, ringing bells and flashing lights to signal each capture of
a cosmic ray. Guest speaker Albert Einstein explains cosmic rays. Unfortunately, his accent
and a faulty amplification system render his words incomprehensible to the crowd. Upon the
tenth ray’s signal, a huge light is meant to be turned on to illuminate the 600 foot Trylon
triangular spire, but the power source fails.

The RCA -owned NBC network launches regular public television service with the formal
opening of the 1939 New York World’s Fair by President Franklin Roosevelt (the first of only
two appearances he makes on television). The service will air two hours of programs a week, to
be received on RCA sets, in order to “to make the art of television available to the
public.” By the end of the year, a thousand receivers will be sold in the US. Screens are
initially only about five inches across.

1955

The creation of the synthetically created element 101, is announced. It will later be named
Mendelevium , after the historic chemist Dmitri Mendeleev , who is credited with creating the
very first version of the periodic table of elements. The element was first synthesized by a
team lead by Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley.

1973

The first criminal trial using entirely pre-recorded videotape evidence, Ohio v.
McMillion, is heard at the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in Ohio.

Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) splits their stock two-for one.

1982

New York Superior Court Judge Milton Feller declares a community ordinance in Garwood, New
Jersey that requires video game players to be at least eighteen years old unconstitutional.

1987

Stephen “Woz” Wozniak files for a divorce from his second wife Candice Clark citing
irreconcilable differences as the cause. He will receive custody of their children, Jese
John, and Sara Nadine. Their third child, Stephen, will be born seven months later.

1990

The Star Trek: The Next Generation episode “ Hollow Pursuits ” first airs. (No. 169) In the

Memory Alpha entry

Version 0.03 of the RemoteAccess Bulletin Board System (BBS) is released.

1992

In the first four months of the year, Microsoft has shipped ten million copies of Windows 3.0 .

1993

Astronaut Hans Schlegel receives a test infusion while in orbit, aboard the space shuttle
Columbia. The German physicist has saline solution warmed to body temperature pumped into
him through a needle. The experiment provides a way to address dehydration and other common
health issues associated with space travel, such as puffy faces and skinny legs.

The World Wide Web is born when the directors of CERN release the source code of World Wide Web
into the public domain, making it freely available to anyone, without licensing fees. The
decision to make their products freely available, which is very much in line with the
decisions of the earlier Internet pioneers, is possibly the most important moment in the
history of the Internet. Several versions of the software are still available to download
from evolt.org’s browser archive .

1995

The National Science Foundation (NSF) no longer allows direct access to the NSF backbone. The
NSF has contracted with four companies that will be providers of access to its backbone. These
companies will sell connections to groups, organizations, and companies. Visit the
official NSF website .

1996

Blizzard Entertainment releases Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness , an expansion pack for the
real-time strategy game WarCraft II.

The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA) issues a correction to figures
released the day prior. Due to an error made by a CEMA representative while referring to a table
of sales figures, the number of television sales for the first quarter were cited as 660,000.
The correct number, however, is 4.6 million, far more than the number of personal computers
sold during the same period.

1997

Power Computing begins shipping the PowerCenter Pro line for the Mac OS . The systems feature
180 to 210MHz PowerPC 604e processors , 16X CD-ROM drives. Price: US$2,095



Image:
http://thegreatgeekmanual.com/images/geekhistory/april/star-trek-voyager-episode-distant-origin.jpg
The Star Trek: Voyager episode “ Distant Origin ” first airs. (No. 323) In the episode, the
crew encounter the Voth, an advanced race who, according to the “Distant Origin” theory

America (SCEA) to levy a Temporary Restraining Order against them for the release of the
Personal Computer-based PlayStation emulator BLEEM! .

2001

Imagine Media announces that it is closing down its online operations, including its online
ad network, the Maximum PC Network, and Daily Radar (www.dailyradar.com), a popular online
gaming publication similar to GameSpot and GameSpy. When the Daily Radar was shut down, a
notice is left on the website stating, “The internet soufflé has collapsed (you probably
read about it in the news), and Daily Radar is no longer publishing.” The notice was
accompanied by a humor list of reason why the site was shut down. While Daily Radar was a popular
review site, it was often the subject of controversy and criticism, as evidence by its
frequently lampooning in the Penny Arcade webcomic .

2002

Indiana State University (ISU) inadvertently posts personal information about ten
thousand students who were enrolled in the 1996-97 school year on the Internet, including
their names and social security numbers. The information will remain online for two weeks,
from April 30 to May 14. The incident was not the result of hacking, and, according to later
interviews, no one was disciplined for the mistake, though it does make national headlines.

2003

The Star Trek: Enterprise episode “ Cogenitor ” first airs. (No. 222) In the episode, the
crew of the Enterprise encounters the Vissians, a more technologically advanced species,
and Trip finds himself transfixed on the fact the Vissians are a three-sexed species,
befriending one of them with tragic results. Memory Alpha entry

time integrals of current and voltage. The memristor was first conceived in 1971 by Leon Chua .
The discovery will have a tremendous impact on electronic engineering.
