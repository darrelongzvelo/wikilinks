Tip # 1 Play the ball as it lies , play the course as you find it, and if you cannot do either, do what
is fair. But to do what is fair, you need to know the Rules of Golf.

In addition to the rules golf adheres to a code of conduct, known as etiquette , which generally
means playing the game with due respect for the golf course and other players. Etiquette is
often seen as being as important to the sport as the rules themselves. Tip # 2 Men's
professional senior golf is for players aged 50 and above. Golf differs from all other sports
in having lucrative competitions for this age group. The leading senior tour is the U.S. based
Champions Tour , which was established in 1980 (as the Senior PGA Tour). It has established a
roster of five major championships. These events are all played over four rounds, whereas
other senior tournaments are generally played over three roundsâ€”only one other
current Champions Tour event, the limited-field and season-ending Charles Schwab Cup
Championship , is played over four rounds. A golfer's performances can be quite variable from
one round to the next, so playing an extra round increases the likelihood that the senior
majors will be won by leading players. Tip # 3
