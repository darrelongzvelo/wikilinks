Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American recording artist and actress. Known
for a series of sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records,
as well as elaborate stage shows, television and film roles, she has been a prominent figure in
popular culture since the early 1970s. The youngest child of the Jackson family , she began her
career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other
television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame .

After signing a recording contract with A&M in 1982, she came to prominence following the
release of her third studio album Control (1986). Her collaborations with record producers
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues , funk , disco , rap , and
industrial beats, which led to crossover appeal in popular music . In addition to receiving
recognition for the innovation in her records, choreography, music videos, and prominence
on radio airplay and MTV , she was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious
lyrics.

In 1991, she signed the first of two record-breaking, multi-million dollar contracts with
Virgin Records , establishing her as one of the highest paid artists in the industry. Her debut
album under the label, Janet (1993), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol as she began
to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role
in Poetic Justice ; since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the 1990s,
Billboard named her the second most successful recording artist of the decade, following
Mariah Carey . She has amassed an extensive catalog of hits, with singles such as " Nasty ", "
Rhythm Nation ", " That's the Way Love Goes ", " Together Again ", and " All for You " her most
iconic.

Having sold over 100 million records, she is ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the
history of contemporary music . 1 The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) lists
her as the eleventh best-selling female artist in the United States, with 26 million
certified albums. 2 In 2008, Billboard magazine released its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top
Artists , ranking her at number seven. In 2010, the magazine announced the "Top 50 R&B / Hip-Hop
Artists of the Past 25 Years", ranking her at number five. One of the world's most awarded
artists, her longevity, records and achievements reflect her influence in shaping and
redefining the scope of popular music. She has been cited as an inspiration among numerous
performers.

Jackson (bottom row) in a 1976 CBS photo on the set of The Jacksons

Janet Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of ten children, to Katherine Esther
(nÃ©e Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson . 3 The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout
Jehovah's Witnesses ; Jackson stated that although she was raised as a Jehovah's Witness, she
eventually stopped practicing organized religion and views her relationship with God as
"one-on-one". 4 By the time Jackson was a toddler, her older brothersâ€” Jackie , Tito ,
Jermaine , Marlon and Michael â€”were performing music at nightclubs and theaters as
The Jackson 5 . In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown , and by the end of the
year they had recorded the first of four consecutive number one singles. The Jackson 5's
success allowed the family to move to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, where
they settled in a gated mansion called Hayvenhurst. 3 Although born into a family of
professional musicians, Jackson, whose love of horses resulted in a desire to become a
race-horse jockey, had no aspiration to become an entertainer. Despite this, her father
planned for her to pursue a career in entertainment. She once commented, "No one ever asked me
if I wanted to go into show business ... it was expected." 3

In 1973, at the age of seven, Jackson appeared on stage in Las Vegas Strip with her siblings in a
routine show at the MGM Casino. 3 Jane Cornwell documented in her biography of the singer,
Janet Jackson (2002), that at age eight, her father Joseph told her not to call him "Dad"
anymore since he was her manager; he told her she would henceforth address him as "Joseph". 3
She began her career as an actress with the debut of the CBS variety show The Jacksons (1976), in
which she appeared with her siblings Tito, Rebbie , Randy , Michael, Marlon, La Toya and
Jackie. 3 In 1977, she was selected by producer Norman Lear to play a recurring role as Penny
Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times . 3 From 1979 to 1980, she starred in A New Kind of Family as
Jojo Ashton, and then joined the cast of Diff'rent Strokes , portraying Charlene Duprey from
1981 to 1982. 3 During this time, black teenage girls adopted her layered hair style and wore
hooped earrings in a similar fashion as she did, which made her a role model for black youth at a
time when the television industry appealed overwhelmingly to white audiences. 5 She played a
recurring role during the fourth season of the television series Fame as Cleo Hewitt, though
she later commented that the series was not a project she enjoyed working on. 6 7

1982â€“85: Early recordings



Although Jackson was initially apprehensive about starting a music career, she agreed to
participate in recording sessions with her family. The first of these, a duet with her brother
Randy titled "Love Song for Kids", took place in 1978. When she was sixteen, her father
arranged a contract for her with A&M Records . 3 Her debut album, Janet Jackson , produced by
soul singers Angela Winbush , RenÃ© Moore and Leon F. Sylvers III, was released in 1982, the
entire production of which was overseen by her father Joseph. 3 It peaked at number six on the
Billboard Hot R&B albums chart. 8

Jackson's second album, Dream Street , was released two years later. Her father recruited her
brothers to help produce the album: Marlon co-wrote two of the album's tracks, while Tito,
Jackie and Michael provided background vocals. 3 Dream Street reached number nineteen on the
R&B albums chart; its sales were less than that of her debut album. 8 The album's only hit, "
Don't Stand Another Chance ", peaked at number nine on Billboard ' s R&B singles chart. 9 In late
1984, Jackson eloped with childhood friend and fellow R&B singer James DeBarge . They
divorced shortly afterwards, and the marriage was annulled in mid-1985. 10 In 1985 Jackson
joined her sister, La Toya, as a chorist under La Toya's number "Baby Sister" at the Yamaha
Music Festival where they ended up with a silver medallion and an "Outstanding Song Award".

"Nasty" was written as a response to an incident of sexual harassment Jackson faced during the
recording of Control . The song features a triplet swing beat.

Following the release of Dream Street , Jackson decided to separate her business affairs from
her family. She later commented, "I just wanted to get out of the house, get out from under my
father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do, telling him that I didn't
want to work with him again." 7 A&M Records executive John McClain hired producers Jimmy Jam
and Terry Lewis to work with her. Within six weeks, Jackson, Jam and Lewis crafted her third
studio album, Control . 11 Jackson recalled that during the recording of the album, she was
threatened by a group of men outside of her hotel in Minneapolis. She stated that "[t]he danger
hit home when a couple of guys started stalking me on the street ... Instead of running to
Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty'
and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, out of a sense of self-defense." 12

Though Jam and Lewis were concerned with achieving cross-over appeal, their primary goal was
to create a strong following for the singer within the African American community first. 13
Jam commented, "[w]e wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America ... we
were going for the black album of all time." 13 Released in February 1986, the album peaked at
number one on the Billboard  200, with over 200,000 copies sold in one week. 8 14 Los Angeles
Times critic Connie Johnson wrote: "Though still a teen-ager, this singer's stance is
remarkably nervy and mature. She has a snotty sort of assurance that permeates several cuts,
plus the musical muscle to back it up." 15 The Newsweek review of Control noted that the album
was "an alternative to the sentimental balladry and opulent arrangements of Patti LaBelle
and Whitney Houston ." 16 Rob Hoerburger of Rolling Stone asserted, " Control is a better album
than Diana Ross has made in five years and puts Janet in a position similar to the young Donna
Summer 'sâ€”unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above
it." 17 Five of the album's singlesâ€”" What Have You Done for Me Lately ", " Nasty ", " When
I Think of You ", " Control ", and " Let's Wait Awhile "â€”peaked within the top 5 of the
Billboard Hot 100 . 18 "When I Think of You" became Jackson's first single to peak at number one.
" The Pleasure Principle " became a top 20 hit, peaking at number fourteen. 18 Most of the
Control music videos were choreographed by a then-unknown Paula Abdul . Jonathan Cohen of
Billboard magazine commented "[Jackson's] accessible sound and spectacularly
choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV, and helped the channel evolve from rock
programming to a broader, beat-driven musical mix." 11

Control was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America,
and has sold over fourteen million copies worldwide. 1 19 It won four American Music Awards ,
from twelve nominationsâ€”a record that has yet to be brokenâ€”and was nominated
for Album of the Year at the 1987 Grammy Awards . 20 21 22 Musicologist Richard J. Ripani Ph.D.,
author of The New Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm & Blues, 1950â€“1999 (2006), observed
that the album was one of the first successful records to influence the rise of new jack swing by
creating a fusion of R&B, rap, funk, disco and synthesized percussion. 23 The success of
Control , according to Ripani, bridged the gap between R&B and rap music. 23

"Rhythm Nation" encompasses the full range of new jack swing genre. The use of sample loop and
triplet swing are present, while vocals for the song are alternatively sung in octaves or
rapped in spoken verse.

In September 1989, Jackson released her fourth album, Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 .
Though executives at A&M wanted an album similar to Control , she was determined to imbue her
music with a socially conscious message that complimented her songs about love and
relationships. 24 She stated, "I'm not naiveâ€”I know an album or a song can't change the
world. I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience's attention, and to hold it long
enough for them to listen to the lyrics and what we're saying." 25 Producer Jimmy Jam told The
Boston Globe , "We would always have a TV turned on, usually to CNN  ... And I think the social
slant of songs like Rhythm Nation, State of the World and The Knowledge came from that." 26
Rolling Stone magazine's Vince Aletti observed Jackson shifted from "personal freedom to
more universal concernsâ€”injustice, illiteracy, crime, drugsâ€”without
missing a beat." 27

Peaking at number one on the Billboard  200, the album was later certified six times platinum
and eventually sold over fourteen million copies worldwide. 1 8 19 The release became the only
album in history to produce number one hits on the Billboard  Hot 100 in three separate
calendar yearsâ€”" Miss You Much " in 1989, " Escapade " and " Black Cat " in 1990, and " Love
Will Never Do (Without You) " in 1991â€”and the only album in the history of the Hot 100
to have seven top 5 hit singles. 28 29 The corresponding music video for "Rhythm Nation" won the
1989 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video . 30 Billboard named Rhythm Nation 1814 the
number-one selling album of the year in 1990, winning a record 15 Billboard music awards. 31 32
33 The Rhythm Nation World Tour , Jackson's first world tour in support of a studio album,
became the most successful debut tour by any recording artist. 34 As Jackson began her tour,
she was acknowledged for the cultural impact of her music. Joel Selvin of the San Francisco
Chronicle wrote "the 23-year-old has been making smash hit records for four years, becoming a
fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country", and William Allen,
then-executive vice president of the United Negro College Fund , told the Los Angeles Times ,
"Jackson is a role model for all young people to emulate and the message she has gotten to the
young people of this country through the lyrics of 'Rhythm Nation 1814' is having positive
effects." 35 36 She established the "Rhythm Nation Scholarship" as a joint venture with the
United Negro College Fund, as well as donating funds from her concert tour to other
educational programs, raising over $1/2 million dollars to fund educational projects. 37 38
Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge (2000)
documented that Jackson's success during this time period placed her on par with several
other recording artists, including her older brother Michael Jackson, Madonna and Tina
Turner . 39

With the release of Rhythm Nation 1814 , Jackson fulfilled her contract with A&M Records. In
1991, after being approached personally by Virgin Records owner Richard Branson , she signed
a highly publicized multi-million dollar contract with the label. 40 41 42 The contract
value, estimated between $32â€“50 million, made her the highest paid recording artist
in contemporary music, until her brother Michael signed a $65 million dollar contract with
Sony only a few days later. 43 Ebony reported: "No individual or group has impacted the world of
entertainment as have Michael and Janet Jackson, who both signed multimillion dollar
contracts in recent months ... There are many imitators, but few can match Michael and
Janet's stunning style and dexterity." 43 Her reputation as a fashion icon also garnered
recognition, in that "[a]s Janet was entertaining 2 million fans during her triumphant
Rhythm Nation tour, hoards of teen girls were imitating her distinctive lookâ€”black
quasi-military long jackets, black tight-tight pants, and big white shirts." 43 That same
year, she secretly entered into her second marriage with long-term friendâ€”dancer,
songwriter and director RenÃ© Elizondo, Jr. 44 In early 1992, Jackson recorded a song
entitled " The Best Things in Life Are Free " with Luther Vandross , featuring Bell Biv DeVoe and
Ralph Tresvant , for the Mo' Money film soundtrack. 45

1993â€“96: Janet , Poetic Justice and Design of a Decade 1986/1996

Jackson featured on a 1993 cover of Rolling Stone with the hands of her then-unknown husband
RenÃ© Elizondo, Jr. cupping her breasts.

In August 1992, after completing work on Poetic Justice , Jackson set out to plan on recording
her first album for Virgin Records. Recording sessions for the album began in September 1992,
commencing in the first quarter of 1993. In May 1993, Jackson's fifth studio album Janet , was
released and debuted at number one on the Billboard  200. 8 She commented, "[c]ertain people
feel I'm just riding on my last name ... That's why I just put my first name on janet. and why I
never asked my brothers to write or produce music for me." 46 Billboard magazine's Larry Flick
noted she "also broadens her musical scope on 'janet.' by layering deep house , swing jazz , hip
hop , rock, and Caribbean elements on top of a radio-minded jack/funk foundation." 47 Rolling
Stone wrote: "As princess of America's black royal family, everything Janet Jackson does is
important. Whether proclaiming herself in charge of her life, as she did on Control (1986), or
commander in chief of a rhythm army dancing to fight society's problems ( Rhythm Nation 1814 ,
from 1989), she's influential. And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her
new album, Janet. , it's a cultural moment." 48 The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004)
commented that the album's number one hit single " That's the Way Love Goes "â€”winner of
the 1994 Grammy Award for Best R&B Song â€”and the top 10 singles " If ", " Because of Love ",
" You Want This ", and " Any Time, Any Place ", all contained "grown-up desires". 30 49 Janet was
certified six times platinum by the RIAA, with worldwide sales exceeding twenty million
copies. 19 50 It is the fourth best selling R&B album of the Nielsen SoundScan era as well as the
best-selling by a female solo artist, scanning 7,035,000 units in the United States. 51

In July 1993, Jackson made her film debut in Poetic Justice . Rolling Stone described her
performance as "a beguiling film debut" despite her inexperience, while The Washington Post
considered her "believably eccentric". 52 53 Several reviews were also negative, as Owen
Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted she "isn't an inept actress, yet there are no more
edges to her personality than there are to her plastic Kewpie-doll visage." 54 Jackson's
ballad " Again " was featured in the film, and she received her first Golden Globe and Academy
Award nominations for Best Original Song. 55 56 In September 1993, Jackson appeared topless
on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine with the hands of her then-husband RenÃ© Elizondo,
Jr. covering her breasts. The photograph is the original full-length version of the cropped
image used on the cover of the Janet album, shot by Patrick Demarchelier . 57 Sonia Murray of The
Vancouver Sun later reported, "Jackson, 27, remains clearly established as both role model
and sex symbol; the Rolling Stone photo of Jackson ... became one of the most recognizable,
and most lampooned, magazine covers of the year." 58 David Ritz likened her transformation to
Marvin Gaye , stating "[j]ust as Gaye moved from What's Going On to Let's Get It On , from the
austere to the ecstatic, Janet, every bit as serious-minded as Marvin, moved from Rhythm
Nation to janet. , her statement of sexual liberation." 12 Her second world tourâ€”the
Janet World Tour â€”garnered critical acclaim as Michael Snyder of the San Francisco
Chronicle described Jackson's stage performance as erasing the line between "stadium-size
pop music concerts and full-scale theatrical extravaganzas." 59

During this time period, her brother Michael was immersed in a child sex abuse scandal , of
which he denied any wrongdoing. 60 She gave moral support to her brother, and denied
allegations made by her sister La Toya in her book La Toya: Growing Up in the Jackson Family
(1991) that their parents had abused her and her siblings as children. 41 In an interview with
Lynn Norment of Ebony , she commented on her sister's then-estrangement from the family,
stating, "her [husband Jack Gordon has ... brainwashed her so much she keeps herself away
from us." 61 In addition, she criticized her brother Jermaine for attacking Michael in his
1991 single "Word to the Badd". 61 In December 1994, she collaborated with her brother Michael
on " Scream ", the lead single from his 1995 album HIStory , which was written by both siblings as
a response to the media scrutiny he suffered from being accused of child sexual abuse. 62 The
song debuted at number five on the Hot 100 singles chart, becoming the first song ever to
debut in the top 5. "Scream" is featured in the Guinness Book of Records as the "Most Expensive
Music Video Ever Made" at a cost of $7 million, which was filmed in May 1995. Jackson and her
brother won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video for "Scream". 30

In October 1995, Jackson's first compilation album, Design of a Decade 1986/1996 , was
released via A&M Records. It debuted at number four and peaked at number three on the Billboard
 200. 8 The lead single " Runaway " became the first song by a female artist to debut within the
top ten of the Hot 100, which eventually peaked at number three. 63 64 Design of a Decade
1986/1996 was certified two times platinum by the RIAA and sold over four million copies
worldwide. 19 65 Jackson's influence in popular music continued to garner recognition, as
Steve Morse of The Boston Globe remarked: "If you're talking about the female power elite in
pop, you can't get much higher than Janet Jackson, Bonnie Raitt , Madonna and Yoko Ono . Their
collective influence ... is beyond measure. And who could dispute that Janet Jackson now
has more credibility than brother Michael?" 66 In January 1996, Jackson renewed her contract
with Virgin Records for a reported $80 million dollars. 67 The contract established her as the
then-highest paid recording artist in contemporary music, surpassing the recording
industry's then-unparalleled $60 million dollar contracts earned by her brother, Michael
Jackson, and Madonna. 68 69 70

1997â€“99: The Velvet Rope



During the two year period prior to the release of her sixth studio album, The Velvet Rope ,
Jackson reportedly suffered from depression and anxiety. 7 Michael Saunders of The Boston
Globe considered the album to be an introspective look into her bout with depression,
describing it as a "critical self-examination and an audio journal of a woman's road to
self-discovery." 7 The Velvet Rope also introduced sadomasochism into Jackson's music.
Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine wrote, " The Velvet Rope is a richly dark masterwork that
illustrates that, amid the whips and chains, there is nothing sexier than emotional
nakedness." 71 Larry Flick of Billboard called The Velvet Rope "[t]he best American album of
the year and the most empowering of her last five." 72 Released in October 1997, The Velvet Rope
debuted at number one on the Billboard  200. 8 In August, 1997 the album's lead single, " Got
'til It's Gone ", was released to radio, peaking at number 12 on the Billboard Rhythmic Airplay
Chart . 73 The single sampled the Joni Mitchell song " Big Yellow Taxi ", and featured a cameo
appearance by rapper Q-Tip . "Got 'til It's Gone" won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Short Form
Music Video . 30 The album's second single " Together Again ", became her eighth number one hit
on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, and placing her on par with Elton John , Diana Ross,
and The Rolling Stones . 74 The single spent a record 46 weeks on the Hot 100, as well as
spending 19 weeks on the UK singles chart. 74 " I Get Lonely " peaked at number three on the
Hot 100. 18 The Velvet Rope sold over ten million albums worldwide and was certified three
times platinum by the RIAA. 1 19

Jackson donated a portion of the proceeds earned from "Together Again" to the American
Foundation for AIDS Research . 74 Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed, "[Jackson]
even makes a bid for gay icon status, delivering a diva-ish performance reminiscent of Diana
Ross on 'Together Again' (a post-Aids pop song), singing a paean to homosexuality on the jazzy
'Free Xone' and climaxing (if that's the right word) with a bizarre lesbian reinterpretation
of Rod Stewart 's 'Tonight's the Night' ." 75 Rolling Stone regarded "Free Xone" as the album's
"best song", describing it as an "anti-homophobia track [which] shifts moods and tempos on a
dime, segueing from a Prince -like jam to a masterful sample from Archie Bell and the Drells'
'Tighten Up'." 76 The Velvet Rope was honored by the National Black Lesbian and Gay Leadership
Forum, and received the award for Outstanding Music Album at the 9th Annual GLAAD Media Awards
. 77

In 1998, Jackson began The Velvet Rope World Tour , an international trek that included
Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, New Zealand and Australia. Robert Hilburn of The Los
Angeles Times reported, "[t]here is so much of the ambition and glamour of a Broadway musical
in Janet Jackson's new Velvet Rope tour that it's only fitting that the concert program
credits her as the show's 'creator and director'." 78 Her HBO special, The Velvet Rope: Live in
Madison Square Garden , was watched by more than fifteen million viewers. The two hour concert
beat the ratings of all four major networks in homes that were subscribed to HBO. 79 The HBO
concert special was awarded four Emmy nominations including one win. 80 Jackson donated a
portion of her concert ticket sales to America's Promise , a non-profit organization
designed by Colin Powell to assist disenfranchised youth. 81

The following month, Jackson separated from Elizondo Jr. 82 As her world tour came to a close in
1999, Jackson lent guest vocals to a number of songs by other artists, including Shaggy's " Luv
Me, Luv Me ", for the soundtrack to How Stella Got Her Groove Back , "God's Stepchild" from the
Down on the Delta soundtrack, " Girlfriend/Boyfriend " with BLACKstreet , and " What's It
Gonna Be?! " with Busta Rhymes . She also performed a duet with Elton John for the song "I Know the
Truth". At the 1999 World Music Awards , Jackson received the Legend Award alongside Cher for
"outstanding contribution to the pop industry." 83 As 1999 ended, Billboard magazine ranked
Jackson as the second most successful artist of the decade, behind Mariah Carey . 84

2000â€“03: Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and All for You



In July 2000, Jackson appeared in her second film, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps , as
Professor Denise Gaines, opposite Eddie Murphy . The film became her second to open at number
one at the box office, grossing an estimated $42.7 million dollars in its opening weekend. 85
86 Her contribution to the film's soundtrack, " Doesn't Really Matter ", became her ninth
number one Billboard Hot 100 single. In the same year, Jackson's husband filed for divorce.
Jeff Gordinier of Entertainment Weekly reported that for eight of the thirteen years she and
Elizondo had known one another, "[they] were marriedâ€”a fact they managed to hide not
only from the international press but from Jackson's own father." 44 Elizondo filed a
multi-million dollar lawsuit against her, estimated between $10â€“25 million;
they did not reach a settlement until 2003. 44 87

Jackson was awarded the American Music Awards ' Award of Merit in March 2001 for "her finely
crafted, critically acclaimed and socially conscious, multi-platinum albums." 88 She
became the inaugural honoree of the " mtvICON " award, "an annual recognition of artists who
have made significant contributions to music, music video and pop culture while
tremendously impacting the MTV generation." 89 Jackson's seventh album, All for You , was
released in April 2001, debuting at number one on the Billboard  200. 8 Selling 605,000
copies, All for You had the highest first-week sales total of her career. 90 Stephen Thomas
Erlewine of Allmusic stated "[Jackson's] created a record that's luxurious and sensual,
spreading leisurely over its 70 minutes, luring you in even when you know better", and Jon
Pareles of The New York Times commented, "[a]s other rhythm and blues strips down to match the
angularity of hip-hop, Ms. Jackson luxuriates in textures as dizzying as a new infatuation."

The album's title-track, " All for You ", debuted on the Hot 100 at number fourteen, the
highest debut ever for a single that was not commercially available. 93 Teri VanHorn of MTV
dubbed Jackson "Queen of Radio" as the single made radio airplay history, "[being] added
to every pop, rhythmic and urban radio station that reports to the national trade magazine
Radio & Records" in its first week. 93 The single peaked at number one, where it topped the
Hot 100 for seven weeks. 94 It received the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording . 30 The
second single, " Someone to Call My Lover ", which contained a heavy guitar loop of America's "
Ventura Highway ", peaked at number three on the Hot 100. 95 All for You was certified double
platinum by the RIAA and sold more than nine million copies worldwide. 19 96

Jackson's All for You Tour began in July, 2001. Los Angeles Times' pop music critic Robert
Hilburn gave a negative review of the concert tour, comparing it unfavorably to Madonna's
Drowned World Tour and Britney Spears ' Dream Within a Dream Tour . Hilburn remarked: "At 35,
Jackson is only eight years younger than Madonna, but her presentation feels more akin to
Britney Spears'. Madonna knows how to dig beneath the surface; Jackson lives on it." 97
Hilburns' review sparked backlash from those who felt Jackson gave the superior
performance. David Massey commented that "Janet outdid the Material Girl by a mile ... And
the gall to bring Britney Spears' name into the picture by saying Janet's show is like
Britney's? Hello, it's the other way around!" 98 Similarly, Rudy Scalese complimented
Jackson's performance, stating: "Janet Jackson hasn't skipped a beat. She is still the
Queen of Pop." 98 Jackson donated a portion of the proceeds from the tour's ticket sales to
the Boys & Girls Clubs of America , with President Roxanne Spillett stating, "[t]he increased
awareness she will bring to our cause, along with her generous financial contribution, will
help us reach an even greater number of young people in search of hope and opportunity." 99

In 2002, Jackson collaborated with reggae singer Beenie Man on the song " Feel It Boy ". She
later admitted regret over the collaboration after discovering Beenie Man's music often
contained homophobic lyrics, and soon issued an apology to her gay fans in an article
published in The Voice . 100 Jackson also began her relationship with record producer
Jermaine Dupri that same year. 101

2004â€“05: Super Bowl XXXVIII and Damita Jo

Jackson and Justin Timberlake at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in February 2004.

For the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in February 2004, Jackson performed a medley of her
singles "All for You" and "Rhythm Nation"; she then performed alongside Justin Timberlake .
As Timberlake sang the lyric "gonna have you naked by the end of this song" from his single " Rock
Your Body ", he tore open her top, exposing her right breast. After the performance, Jackson
apologized, calling it an accident, and said that Timberlake was supposed to pull away the
bustier and leave the red-lace bra intact. 102 She further commented, "I am really sorry if I
offended anyone. That was truly not my intention ... MTV, CBS, the NFL had no knowledge of
this whatsoever, and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end." 103 Timberlake
also issued an apology, calling the accident a " wardrobe malfunction ". 102 TIME reported
that the incident became the most replayed moment in TiVo history and Monte Burke of Forbes
magazine reported "[t]he fleeting moment enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo]
subscribers to sign up." 104 105 Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World
Records as "Most Searched in Internet History" and the "Most Searched for News Item". 106 CBS,
the NFL , and MTV (CBS's sister network, which produced the halftime show), denied any
knowledge of, and all responsibility for, the incident. Still, the Federal Communications
Commission continued an investigation, ultimately losing its appeal for a $550,000 fine
against CBS. 107

As a result of the incident, CBS would only allow Jackson and Timberlake to appear during the
46th Grammy Awards ceremony if they each made a public apology to the network, without
attributing the incident to a "wardrobe malfunction". Timberlake issued an apology, but
Jackson refused. 108 Jermaine Dupri resigned from his position on the Grammy Awards
committee as a result. 109 The controversy halted plans for Jackson to star in a made-for-TV
biopic on the life on singer Lena Horne for ABC-TV . Though Horne was reportedly displeased by
the Super Bowl incident and insisted that ABC pull Jackson from the project, according to
Jackson's representatives, she withdrew from the project willingly. 110

In March 2004, Jackson's eighth studio album, Damita Jo (Jackson's middle name), was
released debuting at number two on the Billboard  200. 8 111 Allmusic's Stephen Thomas
Erlewine referred to the album as "the aural equivalent of hardcore pornographyâ€”it
leaves nothing to the imagination and it's endlessly repetitive." 112 Alternatively, a
review by Ann Powers of Blender magazine asserted: "Artfully structured, unapologetically
explicit, Damita Jo is erotica at its friendliest and most well-balanced. This hour-plus of
Tantric flow even erases the memory of Jacksonâ€™s clunky Super Bowl breast-baring."
113 By the end of the month it was certified platinum by the RIAA, and eventually sold over three
million albums worldwide. 19 114 Although the album debuted at number two, its four singles
all failed to become top 40 hits. Keith Caulfield of Billboard commented, "[f]or a singles
artist like Jackson, who has racked up 27 top 10 Hot 100 singles in her career, including 10
No. 1s, this could probably be considered a disappointment." 111 Billboard' s Clover Hope
reported Damita Jo "was largely overshadowed by the Super Bowl fiasco" and that Jermaine
Dupri, the then-president of the urban music department at Virgin Records, expressed
"sentiments of nonsupport from the label." 115

Jackson appeared as a host of Saturday Night Live on April 10, 2004 and also appeared as a guest
star on the television sitcom Will & Grace portraying herself. 116 In November 2004, Jackson
was honored as an African-American role model by 100 Black Men of America , Inc., who presented
her with the "organization's Artistic Achievement Award saluting 'a career that has gone
from success to greater success'." 117 Though the New York Amsterdam News reported "[t]here
were a number of attendees who expressed dismay over presenting an award to the 38-year-old
performer" because of the Super Bowl incident, the organization's President Paul Williams
responded, "[a]n individual's worth can't be judged by a single moment in that person's
life." 118 119 In June 2005, she was honored with a Humanitarian Award by the Human Rights
Campaign and AIDS Project Los Angeles , in recognition of her work and involvement in raising
money for AIDS charities. 120

Jackson with the winners of the "Design Me" contest held for her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O.

To promote her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O. , Jackson appeared on the cover of Us Weekly in June
2006, which became one of the magazine's best-selling issues. 121 Virgin Records released 20
Y.O. in September 2006, which debuted at number two on the Billboard  200. 8 Janine Coveney of
Billboard reported the album title, 20 Years Old , represents "a celebration of the joyful
liberation and history-making musical style of her 1986 breakthrough album, Control ." 122
Rolling Stone magazine's Evan Serpick remarked "[t]he title of Janet Jackson's latest album
refers to the two decades since she released her breakthrough, Control , with hits like
'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately.' If we were her, we wouldn't make the
comparison." 123 However, Glenn Gamboa of Newsday gave the album a positive rating, stating
that "[o]n '20 Y.O.' she skips all that drama of breaking free and asserting herself. She also
keeps most of the tie-me-up, tie-me-down sexual raunch of her recent albums in the closet.
This album is all about dancing and returning to her R&B roots." 124

The album's lead single " Call on Me ", a duet with rapper Nelly , peaked at number twenty-five on
the Hot 100. 18 20 Y.O. was certified platinum by the RIAA and sold 679,000 copies in the U.S.
and 1.2 million worldwide. 19 125 126 Billboard magazine reported the release of 20 Y.O.
satisfied Jackson's contract with Virgin Records; Jermaine Dupri, who co-produced 20 Y.O. ,
left his position as head of urban music at Virgin following the "disappointing performance"
of Jackson's album. 127

In January 2007, Jackson was ranked the seventh richest woman in the entertainment business
by Forbes magazine, having amassed a fortune of over $150 million. 128 Later that year, she
starred opposite Tyler Perry as a psychotherapist named Patrica in the feature film Why Did I
Get Married? . It became her third consecutive film to open at number one at the box office,
grossing $21.4 million in its first week. 129 Variety magazine's Ronnie Scheib described
Jackson's performance as charming, yet bland, while Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe
commented that Jackson portrayed her character with "soft authority". 130 131 In February
2008, Jackson won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion
Picture for her role. 132

Jackson performs during the Rock Witchu Tour 2008.

In July 2007, Jackson changed labels and signed a record contract with Island Records . Her
tenth studio album, Discipline , was released in February 2008, debuting on the Billboard
 200 at number one. 8 Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly remarked, "her boy-crazy
lyricsâ€”which often sound like the cheesy text messages of a lovesick
adolescentâ€”certainly lack the flavor needed to put this once-celebrated pop star
back on top of critics' lists." 133 Andy Kellman of Allmusic expressed: "Janet probably won't
hit that late-'80s peak again, but that is no excuse to write her off." 134 Her single, "
Feedback ", peaked at number nineteen on the Hot 100. 18 In April 2008, Jackson received the
Vanguard Award at the 19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards, honoring her contributions in
promoting equal rights for LGBT people. 77 GLAAD President Neil G. Giuliano commented, "Ms.
Jackson has a tremendous following inside the LGBT community and out, and having her stand
with us against the defamation that LGBT people still face in our country is extremely
significant." 77 Jackson's fifth concert tourâ€”the Rock Witchu Tour â€”began
in September 2008. 135 That same month, she and her record label parted ways through mutual
agreement. Rodney 'Darkchild' Jerkins , who produced the album expressed, "I felt like it
wasn't pushed correctly ... She just didn't get her just-do as an artist of that magnitude."
136 In the fourteen months she was associated with Island, her record had sold 449,000 copies
and did not receive RIAA certification. Billboard reported that because of Jackson's
dissatisfaction with her album's promotion, "the label agreed to dissolve their
relationship with the artist at her request." 137 138

In June 2009, Jackson's brother Michael died at age 50. At the 2009 BET Awards , she spoke
publicly for the first time concerning his death, stating "I'd just like to say, to you,
Michael is an icon, to us, Michael is family. And he will forever live in all of our hearts. On
behalf of my family and myself, thank you for all of your love, thank you for all of your support.
We miss him so much." 139 In an exclusive interview with Harper's Bazaar , she revealed she had
first learned of her brother's death while filming on location in Atlanta for Why Did I Get
Married Too? . Amidst the public and private mourning with her family, she focused on work to
deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death; she stated "[i]t's
still important to face reality, and not that I'm running, but sometimes you just need to get
away for a second." 140 During this time, she also ended her seven year relationship with
Jermaine Dupri. 140 In September 2009, she performed "Scream" at the 2009 MTV Video Music
Awards as part of a tribute to Michael. 141 MTV General Manager Stephen Friedman stated: "We
felt there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." 142 She
worked with several world renowned choreographers, with her personal creative director,
Gil Duldulao, coordinating the performance. 142 It was lauded by several critics and Michael
Slezak of Entertainment Weekly commented, "[s]he worked that stage harder than an underpaid
assistant doinâ€™ overtime, and as tributes go, this was as energetic as it was
heartfelt." 143

Her single, " Make Me ", was released following the VMA performance initially as an audio
stream on her official web site, and was later made available for digital download. 144 Soon
after its release, the single became Jackson's 19th number one Hot Dance Club Songs chart. 145
Later that month, Jackson chaired the inaugural benefit of amfAR , The Foundation for AIDS
Research, held in Milan in conjunction with fashion week . CEO Kevin Robert Frost commented,
"[w]e are profoundly grateful to Janet Jackson for joining amfAR as a chair of its first event
in Milan ... She brings incomparable grace and a history of dedication to the fight against
AIDS." 146 One of the signature pieces sold for the auction was a pair of crystal-studded boots
her brother Michael had intended to wear for the This Is It concert tour, which sold for
$14,650. The event raised a total of $1.1 million for the nonprofit organization. She stated,
"I'd just like to thank everyone here in the global fashion community who've done so much to
help amfAR and to support HIV/AIDS research." 147 Her second greatest hits compilation,
Number Ones â€”titled The Best outside of the United Statesâ€”was released in
November, 2009 as a joint venture between Universal Music Enterprises (UMe) and EMI Music .
148 It debuted at number twenty-two on the Billboard  200, selling 37,000 copies in its first
week of release. 8 149 She performed as the opening act for the 37th annual American Music
Awards and as one of the performing acts of the Capital FM December 2009 Jingle Bell Ball at the
London O2 arena . 150 151

2010â€“present: Film projects, True You and Number Ones: Up Close and Personal



In April, 2010, Jackson reprised her role in Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married? sequel, Why
Did I Get Married Too? The film earned $30.1 million at the box office its opening weekend,
debuting at number two. 152 Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe expressed the overall
experience of the film to be "120 minutes of emotional Stairmaster" and added that "watching a
hystericalâ€”and hysterically coiffedâ€”Janet Jackson redecorate a house
with a golf club burns 500 calories. 153 Mike Hale of The New York Times referred to her
performance as "invigorating and oddly funny" while Jackie K. Cooper of The Huffington Post
comments "[s]he is very impressive at times and less so at others. She does show a willingness
to be seen at her most disheveled." 154 155 Her performance earned a nomination for the 2011
NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture . 156 She recorded the lead
single for the film's soundtrack entitled, " Nothing ", which was released prior to the film's
debut. 157 In May 2010, she appeared on the season finale of American Idol , where she performed
"Again", "Nothing", and "Nasty". 158

Jackson headlined the 2010 Essence Music Festival alongside Alicia Keys and Mary J. Blige .
159 According to the Associated Press, "Janet Jackson enthralled the Essence Music Festival
audience Friday, kept them on their feet for more than two hours and reminded fans why seeing
her in concert was worth waiting two years." 160 In July 2010, Jackson became a spokeswoman for
fur label American Legend Cooperative 's Blackglama "What Becomes a Legend Most?" campaign,
previously endorsed by celebrities such as Lena Horne, Elizabeth Taylor , Lauren Bacall and
Diana Ross . 161 According to the company's press release, she was selected as the campaign's
latest "Legend" because she "is an icon in the world of music and entertainment, a true legend.
She represents everything that this storied campaign embodies. Janet is to entertainment
what Blackglama is to luxury." 161 Her endorsement sparked outrage from animal rights group
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) as well as activist Pamela Anderson . 161
Anderson and PETA senior vice president, Dan Mathews, found Jackson's decision
hypocritical, as she has declined to endorse the wearing of fur in the past. 162 In August,
2010, UMe released her third greatest hits collection, Icon: Number Ones , as part of the debut
of the Icon album series; according to the press release, the series features "the greatest
hits, signature tunes and fan favorites of the most popular artists in music history." 163

In November, 2010, she starred as Joanna in the drama For Colored Girls , Tyler Perry's film
adaptation of Ntozake Shange 's play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the
Rainbow Is Enuf (1975). Christopher John Farley of The Wall Street Journal complimented her
performance, stating that "[she] recites verses written by Ntozake Shange, the author of the
play that inspired the film ... But instead of offering up a mannered coffeehouse reading of
the lines, Jackson makes the words sound like ordinaryâ€”though very
eloquentâ€”speech." 164 Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon.com said she "outdoes herself
hereâ€”especially in the scene where she confronts her husband over his secret
life ... It's not just Jackson's short haircut and traumatized eyes that might remind
viewers of Jane Wyman or Joan Crawford ; Perry gets at the mix of masculine
hyper-competitiveness and feminine vulnerability that has always defined Jackson, and
links it to the wily, lonely coldness often captured in Wyman and Crawford performances, a
directorial gambit of tremendous perceptiveness." 165 Manohla Dargis of The New York Times
commented: "Ms. Jackson is, to put it gently, an actress of limited expression. But her quiet
presence has force, partly because of her eerie resemblance to her brother Michael, though
also because her characterâ€™s brittle hauteur, self-involved privilege and
artificiality hasâ€”like the martyrs in ermine played by the likes of Lana Turner
â€”its own weird truth." 166 A number of critics have compared her portrayal of Jo to
Meryl Streep 's Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada . 166 167 168 Her performance earned
her nominations for the 2011 Black Reel Awards in the categories for Outstanding Supporting
Actress and Outstanding Ensemble . 169

Jackson performing during her Number Ones: Up Close and Personal tour.

On November 18, in an exclusive interview with AOL Music's '"The Boombox", Jackson announced
plans to go on her "largest ever world tour" in 2011, supporting her second greatest hits
collection, Number Ones . 170 The tour, entitled Number Ones: Up Close and Personal , will hold
concerts in 35 global cities. 170 The cities will be picked by fans who can submit suggestions
on her official website. 170 During the tour, she will perform her 35 number one hits and
dedicate a song to each city. 170 Jackson partnered with Mattel to release a limited-edition
Barbie bearing her resemblance. Titled "Divinely Janet", the doll was auctioned for $15,000
with proceeds being donated to Project Angel Food . 171 A new self-help book penned by Jackson,
True You: A Journey to Finding and Loving Yourself , was released on February 15, 2011, topping
The New York Times Best Seller list the following month. 172 In March 2011, she signed a film
production contract with Lionsgate "to select, develop and produce a feature film for the
independent studio." 173 Lionsgate president of motion picture production and development
Mike Paseornek stated: "She is a powerful on-screen presence, with a vast audience, and we
believe she will be an equally powerful presence behind the scenes ... We are honored to be
able to provide a home for her ideas, passion and immense talent." 173 Jackson became the first
female pop star to perform at the I. M. Pei glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum . To raise
contributions for the restoration of iconic works of art, she performed "in conjunction with
the museum's biannual fundraising event, 'Liaisons au Louvre,' on Tuesday, June 14." 174
Louvre President-Director Henri Loyrette stated: "Janet Jackson is one of the
worldâ€™s greatest artistic treasures ... Accordingly, we are profoundly honored,
and believe it most fitting, that her performance in the Louvre Museum will be yet another
masterpiece captured under our glorious glass pyramid." 175 In August, 2011, she was
announced as the first celebrity to be featured in the Blackglama "What Makes A Legend Most?"
campaign for two consecutive years. Blackglama CEO Joe Morelli stated: "It became clear in
our discussions of who the Legend should be this year, that continuing the momentum with Janet
made complete sense ... She embodies glamour, luxury, and sophistication, everything
that Blackglama stands for." 176 In November 2011, Jackson partnered with the label to
release a 15-piece collection of luxury fur products, to be carried by Saks Fifth Avenue and
Bloomingdales . 177 She also become spokesperson for Nutrisystem 's "Success" weight-loss
program. 178 Additionally, "Nutrisystem and Ms. Jackson are creating Nutribank to
distribute meals to the hungry, beginning with $10 million in company food contributions for
2012." 178

Musical style and performance



Jackson has a mezzo-soprano vocal range. 179 Many critics have observed she has never been
considered a strong vocalist, noting her voice is often enveloped by the production of her
music. Biographer David Ritz commented, "[h]er wispy voice was a pale echo of Michael's, but
on Janet's albumsâ€”and in her videos and live performances, which revealed a crisp,
athletic dance technique not unlike her brother'sâ€”singing wasn't the point",
commenting that importance was instead placed on "[h]er slamming beats, infectious hooks,
and impeccable production values." 45 Music critic J.D. Considine noted that "[o]n albums,
Jackson's sound isn't defined by her voice so much as by the way her voice is framed by the lush,
propulsive production of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis." 180 Her voice has also been praised on
occasion. Eric Henderson of Slant magazine claimed critics who judged Jackson harshly for
her thin voice "somehow missed the explosive 'gimme a beat' vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes
all over 'Nasty' ... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance
fits into the abstinence anthem 'Let's Wait Awhile'." 181 Classical composer Louis
Andriessen has also praised Jackson for her " rubato , sense of rhythm, sensitivity, and the
childlike quality of her strangely erotic voice." 182

"Black Cat" (1989)

Written by Jackson and produced by Jellybean Johnson, "Black Cat" was recorded using a
mixture of Rockman and Marshall amplifier to give it a heavy metal sound. The song's lyrics
convey a stance against substance abuse.

Jackson's music has encompassed a broad range of genres, including R&B, soul, disco, hip hop,
rap, pop, rock, and dance music. Qadree EI-Amin, Jackson's former personal manager,
commented, "[s]he's bigger than Barbra Streisand because Streisand can't appeal to the
street crowd, as Janet does. But Streisand's rich, elite crowd loves Janet Jackson." 183 Her
records from the 1980s have been described as being heavily influenced by Prince , as her
producers are ex-members of The Time . 184 Sal Cinquemani wrote that in addition to defining
Top 40 radio, she "gave Prince's Minneapolis sound a distinctly feminineâ€”and, with
songs like 'What Have You Done for Me Lately?,' 'Nasty,' 'Control,' and 'Let's Wait Awhile,' a
distinctly feministâ€”spin." 185 Richard J. Ripani documented that when record
producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis collaborated with Jackson on her 1986 album Control , the
trio "crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy
doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility." 23 Rickey
Vincent stated in his book Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One (1996) that she
has often been credited for redefining the standard of popular music with the industrial
-strength beats of the album. 186 Richard Rischar in "A Vision of Love: An Etiquette of Vocal
Ornamentation in African-American Popular Ballads of the Early 1990s" notes that "[t]he
black pop ballad of the mid-1980s had been dominated by the vocal and production style that was
smooth and polished, led by singers Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and James Ingram ." 187
She continued her musical development by blending contemporary urban sound with hip hop in
the 1990s. This included a softer representation of R&B, articulated by lush soulful ballads
and up-tempo dance beats. 188 She has been described as "an artist who has reshaped the sound
and image of rhythm and blues" within the first decade of her career. 189 Critic Karla Peterson
remarked that "[s]he is a sharp dancer, an appealing performer, and as 'That's the Way Love
Goes' provesâ€”an ace pop-song writer." 190 Her material from the 2000s decade has been
viewed less favorably, as Sal Cinquemani comments that "[e]xcept for maybe R.E.M., no other
former superstar act has been as prolific with such diminishing commercial and creative
returns." 185

Jackson has changed her lyrical focus over the years, becoming the subject of analysis in
musicology , African American studies , and gender studies . 191 192 David Ritz compares
Jackson's musical style to that of Marvin Gaye, stating, "[l]ike Marvin, autobiography
seemed the sole source of her music. Her art, also like Marvin's, floated over a reservoir of
secret pain." 193 Much of her success has been attributed to "a series of powerful, metallic
grooves; her chirpy, multi-tracked vocals; and a lyrical philosophy built on pride and
self-knowledge." 194 Ritz has also stated: "The mystery is the low flame that burns around the
perimeters of Janet Jackson's soul. The flame feeds off the most highly combustible
elements: survival and ambition, caution and creativity, supreme confidence and dark
fear." 193 During the 1980s, her lyrics embodied self-actualization , feminist principles
and politically driven ideology. 192 195 Gillian G. Gaar, author of She's a Rebel: The History
of Women in Rock & Roll (2002), described Control as "an autobiographical tale about her life
with her parents, her first marriage, and breaking free." 13 In Encyclopedia of African
American Popular Culture (2010) author Jessie Carney Smith wrote, "[w]ith that album, she
asserted her independence, individuality, and personal power. She challenged audiences to
see her as a transformed person, from an ingÃ©nue to a grow-up, multi-talented celebrity."
5 Referring to Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 as an embodiment of hope, Timothy E.
Scheurer, author of Born in the USA: The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to
the Present (2007) wrote: "It may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There's a Riot Going On and
other African-American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined
by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people." 196

On Janet , Jackson began to deal primarily with sexual themes. Shayne Lee, author of Erotic
Revolutionaries: Black Women, Sexuality, and Popular Culture (2010), wrote that her music
over the following decade "brand[ed] her as one of the most sexually stimulating vocalists of
the 1990s." 197 In You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (1996),
Lilly J. Goren observed that "Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy
diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the
dance-rock divas to pursue." 195 Joshua Klein wrote in The Washington Post that Jackson's
public image over the course of her career had shifted "from innocence to experience,
inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of
which explored the bondsâ€”figuratively and literallyâ€”of love and lust." 198
The song "Free Xone" from The Velvet Rope , which portrays same-sex relationships in a
positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as "a rare incident in which a popular
black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of
heteronormativity , making it a significant song in black sexual politics." 197 Jackson
explained the recurring themes on her later albums by saying, "I love love and I love sex." 199
She stated during promotion for Janet , "I love feeling deeply sexualâ€”and don't mind
letting the world know. For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative
process." 12 The sexual explicit content of her latter albums have drawn mixed
reactionsâ€”ranging from acclaim to abhorrenceâ€”often in juxtaposition to
Madonna, who is seen as her counterpart. 200 Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments "[w]hile sex
indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop
musicâ€”as with anything, it all depends on the artist." 112

Music videos, choreography and live performances



Jackson drew her inspiration for her music videos and performances from the musicals she
watched in her youth, and was heavily influenced by the choreography of Fred Astaire and
Michael Kidd , among others. 201 Throughout her career, she has worked with numerous
professional choreographers such as Paula Abdul , Michael Kidd, and Tina Landon . Landon also
took part in the choreography for Michael and Janet Jackson's 1995 music video Scream . 202
Janine Coveney of Billboard observed that "Jackson's musical declaration of independence
Control launched a string of hits, an indelible production sound, and an enduring image
cemented by groundbreaking video choreography and imagery that pop vocalists still
emulate." 122 Qadree EI-Amin remarked that artists such as " Britney Spears and Christina
Aguilera pattern their performances after Janet's proven dance-diva persona." 183

Jackson (center) performing in the music video for "Rhythm Nation" surrounded by male and
female dancers in militant unisex attire.

Beretta E. Smith-Shomade, author of Shaded Lives: African-American Women and Television
(2002) wrote that "Jackson's impact on the music video sphere came largely through music
sales successes, which afforded her more visual liberties and control. This assuming of
control directly impacted the look and content of her music videos, giving Jackson an agency
not assumed by many other artistsâ€”male or female, Black or White." 203 Parallel
Lines: Media Representations of Dance (1993) documents that her videos have been often been
reminiscent of live concerts or elaborate musical theater. 204 Many of her videos from
Control , Including "Nasty" and "When I Think of You", were choreographed using influences
from Broadway theatre. 204 Multiculturalism has also been a cornerstone of the imagery
represented in Jackson's music videos. 205 The militant iconography of her 1989 video for
"Rhythm Nation" signifies a need for both racial and gender equality; she and her dancers
perform in identical uniforms while Jackson herself "is performing asexually and almost
anonymously in front of, but as one of the members of the group." 206 In the 1990s, her videos
such as 1993's "If"â€”which "[exudes a] ' Last Emperor ' lust and mystery"â€”and
1995's "Runaway" drew cultural influences from the orient . 207 208 Others, such as 1997's
"Got 'til It's Gone" and "Together Again" explore African roots and the serengeti . 209 210
Jackson's music videos have also found rapport within the gay community ; the dramatic
imagery in "Rhythm Nation" led to reenactments of the video in gay clubs, while her 1990 video
for "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" is said to explore the aesthetic of the male body from
both the heterosexual female and gay male perspective. 211 212 She received the MTV Video
Vanguard Award in 1990 for her contributions to the art form, and in 2001 became the first
recipient of the mtvICON award, celebrating her impact on the music industry as a whole. In
2003, Slant Magazine named the videos for "Rhythm Nation" and "Got 'til It's Gone" as two of the
100 Greatest Music Videos of all time, ranked at number 87 and number 10 respectively. 213 214
In 2011, the "Rhythm Nation" music video was voted the tenth best music video of the 1980s by
Billboard . 215

Her music videos have contributed to a higher degree of sexual freedom among young women, as
Jean M. Twenge, author of Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans are More Confident,
Assertive, Entitledâ€”and More Miserable Than Ever Before (2007) wrote: "In Alfred
Kinsey 's studies in the 1950s, only 3% of the young women had received oral sex from a man. By the
mid-1990s, however, 75% of women aged 18-24 had experienced cunnilingus . Music videos by
female artists have contributed to the trend, with both Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson
heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man's head until
he's in exactly the right position." 216 Similarly, Paula Kamen in Her Way: Young Women Remake
the Sexual Revolution (2000) states that "[i]n the early to mid-1990s, oral sex even reached
mainstream music as politically charged demand of truly liberated women," citing TLC , Mary
J. Blige and Janet Jackson as examples of females artist simulating cunnilingus in their
videos. 217 However, accusations of cosmetic surgery, skin lightening and increasingly
hypersexual imagery have led to her being viewed as conforming to a white, male-dominated
view of sexuality, rather than liberating herself or others. 203

Jet magazine reported "Janet's innovative stage performances during her world tours have
won her a reputation as a world-class performer." 218 Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times
stated the "enthralling" choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour "represents the
pinnacle of what can be done in the popping 'n' locking styleâ€”a rapid-fire mixture of
rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements." 219 The Independent writer Nicholas Barber
commented in his review for The Velvet Rope Tour that "Janet's concerts are the pop equivalent
of a summer blockbuster movie, with all the explosions, special effects, ersatz
sentimentality, gratuitous cleavage and emphasis on spectacle over coherence that the term
implies." 220 When Los Angeles Times reporter Robert Hilburn asked Jackson "[d]o you
understand it when people talk about [The Velvet Rope Tour] in terms of Broadway?", she
responded, "I'm crazy about Broadway ... That's what I grew up on." 78 Her Number Ones: Up
Close and Personal tour deviated from the full-scale theatricality found in her previous
concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not
affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the Chicago
Tribune wrote: "In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of
her production ... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a passion
that wasn't always evident in stadiums ... the best Janet Jackson performance I've covered
in 20-plus years." 221

Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News reported that Jackson lip syncs in concert; he
wrote, "Janet Jacksonâ€”one of pop's most notorious onstage
lip-syncersâ€”conceded ... she uses 'some' taped vocals to augment her live vocals.
But she refused to say what percentage of her concert 'voice' is taped and how much is live." 222
Richard Harrington of The Washington Post observed, "[s]ince the advent of MTV and the
proliferation of dance-oriented singers like Milli Vanilli , Madonna, Paula Abdul, Janet
Jackson, George Michael , MC Hammer , Michael Jackson and the New Kids on the Block , audience
expectations have been drastically redefined" noting that few entertainers are capable of
recreating the spectacle of elaborately choreographed music videos while delivering
studio precision vocals. 223 Michael MacCambridge of the Austin American-Statesman , who
reviewed Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour, described lip-syncing as a "moot point",
stating, "Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve
a sound closer to radio versions of singles." 224 MacCambridge also observed "[i]t seemed
unlikely that anyoneâ€”even a prized member of the First Family of Soul
Musicâ€”could dance like she did for 90 minutes and still provide the sort of powerful
vocals that the '90s super concerts are expected to achieve." 224 Similarly, Chris Willman
commented, "[e]ven a classically trained vocalist would be hard-pressed to maintain any
sort of level of volumeâ€”or, more appropriately, 'Control'â€”while bounding
up and down stairs and whipping limbs in unnatural directions at impeccable, breakneck
speed." 219 Critics observed that in the smaller scale of her Number Ones: Up Close and
Personal tour, she forewent lip-syncing. 225 Chris Richards of The Washington Post stated
"even at its breathiest, that delicate voice hasnâ€™t lost the laserlike precision
that seems to be a part of the Jackson family DNA." 226 He complemented her physically
strenuous performance, stating "[g]o on, Janet. Let â€™em see you sweat. Because in a
21st-century popscape where concerts are driven by spectacle, we need to know that beneath
all of the sci-fi costumes, strobe lights and Auto-Tune , weâ€™re still witnessing a
performance by the living, breathing, profusely sweating human being whose name is stamped
on the tickets we just emptied our wallets for." 226

Influences



Jackson has credited her older brothers Michael and Jermaine as her primary musical
influences. 193 She describes actress/singer Lena Horne as a profound inspiration, not only
in her own career, but for black entertainers across multiple generations. Upon Horne's
death in 2010, she stated "[Horne] brought much joy into everyone's livesâ€”even the
younger generations, younger than myself. She was such a great talent. She opened up such
doors for artists like myself." 227 Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of
her idols. 228 Describing herself as "a very big Joni Mitchell fan", she explained: "As a kid I
was drawn to Joni Mitchell records ... Along with Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, Joni's
songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way." 229 230 She holds reverence for Tina Turner,
stating: "Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her
tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I
felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be." 231 She has also named other
socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman , Sly and the Family Stone and U2 as sources of
inspiration. 13 232 Other artists attributed as influences on Jackson's music according to
Rolling Stone are The Ronettes , Dionne Warwick , Tammi Terrell and Diana Ross . 233

Legacy

icon

The baby sister of the "precious Jackson clan", 234 Janet Jackson has striven to distance her
professional career from that of her older brother Michael and the rest of the Jackson family.
Steve Dollar of Newsday wrote that "[s]he projects that home girl-next-door quality that
belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as
poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys ." 235 Phillip
McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her
common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. 236
Joshua Klein wrote, "[f]or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like
an artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his
longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from
'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement
of purpose, 'Control'." 198 Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a
family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a " superstar " in her own right,
rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston,
but also her brother, while "successfully [shifting] her image from a strong, independent
young woman to a sexy, mature adult." 237 By forging her own unique identity through her
artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the "Queen of Pop". 238 239 Klein
argued that "stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that
Janetâ€”Miss Jackson, if you're nastyâ€”would one day replace Michael as true
heir to the Jackson family legacy." 198

Jackson performing during her Rock Witchu Tour in 2008.

She has also been recognized for playing a pivotal role in crossing racial boundaries in the
recording industry, where black artists were once considered to be substandard. 240 In Right
to Rock: The Black Rock Coalition and the Cultural Politics of Race (2004), author Maureen
Mahon states: "In the 1980s, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Prince
were among the African American artists who crossed over ... When black artists cross over
into pop success they cease to be black in the industry sense of the word. They get promoted from
racialized black music to universal pop music in an economically driven process of racial
transcendence." 241 Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues
and Knowledge (2000) documented that Jackson, along with other prominent African-American
women, had achieved financial breakthroughs in mainstream popular music, receiving
"superstar status" in the process. 39 She, alongside her contemporaries "offered viable
creative, intellectual, and business paths for establishing and maintaining agency,
lyrical potency, marketing and ownership." 242 Her business savvy has been compared to that
of Madonna, gaining a level of autonomy which enables "creative latitude and access to
financial resources and mass-market distribution." 243 244 A model of reinvention, author
Jessie Carney Smith wrote that "Janet has continued to test the limits of her transformative
power", receiving accolades in music, film and concert tours throughout the course of her
career. 5

Musicologist Richard J. Ripani identified Jackson as a leader in the development of
contemporary R&B, as her 1986 album Control and its successor Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation
1814 created a unique blend of genre and sound effects, that ushered in the use of rap vocals
into mainstream R&B. 23 Ripani also argues that the popularity of Jackson's signature song
"Nasty" influenced the new jack swing genre developed by Teddy Riley . 23 Leon McDermott of the
Sunday Herald wrote: "Her million-selling albums in the 1980s helped invent contemporary
R&B through Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's muscular, lean production; the sinuous grooves
threaded through 1986's Control and 1989's Rhythm Nation 1814 are the foundation upon which
today's hot shot producers and singers rely." 245 Jim Cullen observed in Popular Culture in
American History (2001) that although it was Michael Jackson's Thriller that originally
synchronized music video with album sales, Janet Jackson was also among the first generation
of artists that saw the visualization of their music elevate them to the status of a pop culture
icon . 246 In July, 1999, she placed at number 77 on VH1 's "100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll".
247 She also placed at number 134 on their list of the "200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All
Time", 248 number seven on the "100 Greatest Women In Music", 249 and at number two on the "50
Greatest Women of the Video Era", behind Madonna. 250 In March 2008, Business Wire reported
"Janet Jackson is one of the top ten selling artists in the history of contemporary music;
ranked by Billboard magazine as the ninth most successful act in rock and roll history, and the
second most successful female artist in pop music history." 251 She is the only female artist
in the history of the Hot 100 to have 18 consecutive top ten hit singles, from "Miss You Much"
(1989) to "I Get Lonely" (1998). 252 The magazine ranked her at number seven on their Hot 100
50th Anniversary "Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists", making her the third most successful female
artist in the history of the chart, following Madonna and Mariah Carey. 253 In November 2010,
Billboard released its "Top 50 R&B / Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years" list and ranked her at
number five. 254 She ranks as the top artist on the chart with 15 number ones in the past
twenty-five years, garnering 27 top ten hits between 1985 and 2001, and 33 consecutive top 40
hits from 1985 through 2004. 254 The most awarded artist in the history of the Billboard Music
Awards with 33 wins, she is one an elite group of musical acts, such as Madonna, Aerosmith ,
Garth Brooks and Eric Clapton , whom Billboard credits for "redefining the landscape of
popular music." 252 255

Den Berry, Virgin Records CEO and Chairman stated: "Janet is the very embodiment of a global
superstar. Her artistic brilliance and personal appeal transcend geographic, cultural and
generational boundaries." 256 Similarly, Virgin Records executive Lee Trink expressed:
"Janet is an icon and historic figure in our culture. She's one of those gifted artists that
people look up to, that people emulate, that people want to believe in ... there's not that
many superstars that stand the test of time." 122 Her musical style and choreography have
influenced and inspired a younger generation of recording artists. Sarah Rodman of the
Boston Herald remarked: "For every hand-fluttering, overwrought, melisma addict out there
aping Mariah's dog calls, there's an equal number trying to match Jackson's bubbling grooves
and fancy footwork, including Britney, Aaliyah and Destiny's Child ." 257 Pop music critic
Gene Stout commented she "has so broadly influenced a younger generation of performers, from
Jennifer Lopez  ... to Britney Spears, who has copied so many of Jackson's dance moves." 258
Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote: "Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely
post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired byâ€”and, in some cases, have
flagrantly apedâ€”the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly
post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style." 259
Artists who are considered to have followed in her footsteps have been referred to as
"Janet-come-lately's." 260 261

Sociologist Shayne Lee commented that, "[a]s Janet enters the twilight of her reign as erotic
Queen of Pop, BeyoncÃ© Knowles emerges as her likely successor." 197 Knowles has expressed
her fondness of Jackson, stating: "I love Janet Jackson! ... I have nothing but positive
things to say about her." 262 Toni Braxton stated that she was inspired by Janet Jackson
"because when she released her Control album, she made it easy for P.K.'s [Preachers' kids]
who were supposed to be sweet and docile to get comfortable with feeling sexy." 263 Aaliyah
commented, "I admire her a great deal. She's a total performer ... I'd love to do a duet with
Janet Jackson." 264 Jennifer Lopez lauded Jackson's videography, stating her music videos
"had such an impact on me as a fan but also as an artist." 257 'N Sync and Usher , who performed as
two of the opening acts for The Velvet Rope World Tour, credit her for teaching them how to
develop stage show into theatrical performance. Usher stated: "I learned a lot about how to
make an artist look like a star. On the personal side, I got a chance to hug her." 265 266 Rozonda
"Chilli" Thomas of TLC recalled that when the group was first forming, she declared "I'm ready
to be the next Janet Jackson!" 267 Britney Spears commented, "I've always been majorly
inspired by Janet in everything she does." 268 Christina Aguilera recalled: "I remember
watching MTV as a little girl. To me, Janet had it all; amazing videos, hot songs and the sexiest
voice." 269 Cassie has referred to herself as a "die-hard Janet Jackson fan" and elaborated,
"I'd love to emulate Janet's careerâ€”totally ... She's incredible, from her moves
to her voice." 270 Jay Bobbin of the Chicago Tribune remarked, "Cassie isn't the first artist
to be measured against Janet Jackson, and odds are she won't be the last." 270 Ciara has
acknowledged Jackson as one of her primary influences, stating: "It seems like just
yesterday I was watching Janet Jackson on TV; now, some people compare me to her." 271 Kelly
Rowland named her the biggest inspiration of her career because "she works extremely hard."
272 Rihanna has commented that "[s]he was one of the first female pop icons that I could relate
to ... She was so vibrant, she had so much energy. She still has power. Iâ€™ve seen her on
stage, and she can stand there for 20 minutes and have the whole arena scream at her. You have to
love Janet." 273 Nicki Minaj claimed Jackson as one of her idols, stating "[i]n 'Rhythm
Nation' she was sexy, strong and mysterious. I always loved the jet black hair, especially the
ponytail with the hat. That's how I tried to dress when I was little." 274 Keri Hilson stated
that she admired Jackson for "just being herself. A great performer." 275 Japanese singer
Crystal Kay commented: "I've always listened to American music and the artists I admire most
are American, like Janet Jackson." 276 Australian DJ and singer Havana Brown claimed Jackson
as her biggest influence, stating "she's my idol" and "I want to be Janet Jackson! But the
DJ-slash-Janet Jacksonâ€”I want to be able to put on big shows, I want dancers, I want
fireworks, I want it all." 277 Other artists who have drawn comparison to Jackson include
MÃœa , 278 Brandy , 279 Tatyana Ali , 280 Christina Milian , 281 Lady Gaga , 282 Namie Amuro , 283
and BoA . 284 Joan Morgan of Essence magazine remarked: "Jackson's Control , Rhythm Nation
1814 and janet. established the singer-dancer imprimatur standard in pop culture we now take
for granted. So when you're thinking of asking Miss Jackson, 'What have you done for me
lately?' remember that Britney, Ciara and BeyoncÃ© live in the house that Janet built." 285

    239 - ^ Janet Jackson is a big deal these days, the Queen of Pop, though we can still call her
    by her first name. So little is she trading off the fame of her brother, so completely has
    she become her own thing, she has all but abandoned the family name. Tour posters, tickets
    and recent album - all say, quite simply "Janet", and leave it at that. Smith, Giles
    (1996-04-21), "Slow riffs, fast riffs, midriffs", The Independent : 26, ISSN  
    0951-9467  

    

    240 - ^ Over the next few years, a significant proportion of music industry revenues were
    generated by a handful of superstar artists; in addition to Michael Jackson, there were
    Lionel Richie, Madonna, Prince, Bruce Springsteen , Whitney Houston, Tina Turner,
    Wham! , Phil Collins , Steve Winwood , Huey Lewis and the News , the Pointer Sisters , Janet
    Jackson, Anita Baker , and a handful of others. A surprising number of the new superstars
    were black. This was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world
    market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music. Garofalo, Reebee
