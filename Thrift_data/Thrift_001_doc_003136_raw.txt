4chan is a website based on the Japanese channel where people can post and discuss pictures and
other images. It was started in 2003 by Moot , who was 15 years old at the time ( Lev Grossman of
TIME published an interview describing Moot's influence as a non-visible administrator as "
one of the most significant " on the evolution of content collaboration) to discuss Anime and
Manga , though now many other topics are discussed. Since its creation in 2003, 4chan has grown
to become the world's largest English-language imageboard, achieving around 400,000,000
impressions and 6,400,000 unique visitors per month (approx. 3.4MM in the US). The website is
mainly popular amongst males age 18-34 and, with its imageboard format, is based fully on
user-generated content. The site has an extremely dedicated, returning audience. So
returning they sometimes act as a solid group of CYBER PRANKERS . PRANK FILE: 1. Users of 4chan
and other websites "raided" Hal Turner by launching DDoS attacks and prank calling his
phone-in radio show during December 2006 and January 2007. The attacks caused Turner's
website to go offline. This cost thousands of dollars of bandwidth bills according to Turner.
In response, Turner sued 4chan, 7chan, and other websites; however, he lost his plea for an
injunction and failed to receive letters from the court. 2. KTTV Fox 11 aired a report on
Anonymous , calling them a group of "hackers on steroids", "domestic terrorists", and
collectively an "Internet hate machine" on July 26, 2007. Slashdot founder Rob Malda posted a
comment made by another Slashdot user, Miang, stating that the story focused mainly on users
of "4chan, 7chan and 420chan". Miang claimed that the report "seems to confuse /b/ (board)
raids and motivational poster templates with a genuine threat to the American public",
arguing that the "unrelated" footage of a van exploding shown in the report was to "equate
anonymous posting with domestic terror". 3. On July 10, 2008, the swastika symbol (卐)
appeared at the top of Google 's Hot Trends list—a tally of the most popular search terms in
the United States—for several hours. It was later reported that the HTML numeric character
reference for the symbol had been posted on /b/, with a request to perform a Google search for
the string. A multitude of /b/ visitors followed the order and pushed the symbol to the top of
the chart, though Google later removed the result. 4. Later that year, the private Yahoo! Mail
account of Sarah Palin , Republican vice presidential candidate in the 2008 United States
presidential election , was hacked by a 4chan user. This followed criticism of Palin and other
politicians supposedly using private email accounts for governmental work. [44] The hacker
posted the account's password on /b/, and screenshots from within the account to Wikileaks .
[45] A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an
email to a friend of Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. However, he
forgot to blank out the password in the screenshot. A multitude of /b/ users attempted to log in
with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident
was criticized by some /b/ users, one of whom complained that "seriously, /b/. We could have
changed history and failed, epically." The FBI and Secret Service began investigating the
incident shortly after its occurrence. On September 20 it was revealed they were questioning
David Kernell, the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell . 5. The
stock price of Apple Inc. fell significantly in October 2008 after a hoax story was submitted
to CNN 's user-generated news site iReport.com claiming that company CEO Steve Jobs had
suffered a major heart attack . The source of the story was traced back to 4chan. 6. In May 2009,
members of the site attacked YouTube, posting pornographic videos on the site. 4chan claimed
responsibility for the attack, one member told the BBC that the attack was in response to
YouTube "deleting music". ALTHOUGH... Dusty the cat In mid-February 2009, two videos
featuring the physical abuse of a domestic cat named Dusty by Kenny Glenn, who was calling
himself "Timmy" were posted on YouTube . The 4chan community was able to track down the
originator of the videos, a fourteen-year-old from Oklahoma, and passed his details to his
local police department. As a result of this, a suspect was arrested and the cat was treated by a
vet and taken to a safe place. BE AWARE MY FRIENDS, TEENAGE PRANKS ARE SWEEPING THE WEB.
