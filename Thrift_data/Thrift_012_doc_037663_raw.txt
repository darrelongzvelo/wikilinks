Tunnel



A tunnel is an underground passageway. The definition of what constitutes a tunnel is not
universally agreed upon. However, in general tunnels are at least twice as long as they are
wide. In addition, they should be completely enclosed on all sides, save for the openings at
each end. Some civic planners define a tunnel as 0.1 miles (0.16 km ) in length or longer, while
anything shorter than this should be called an underpass or a chute . For example, the
underpass beneath Yahata Station in Kitakyushu , Japan is only 0.08 miles (0.13 km) long and
therefore should not be considered a tunnel.

A tunnel may be for pedestrians or cyclists , for general road traffic , for motor vehicles
only, for rail traffic, or for a canal . Some are aqueducts , constructed purely for carrying
water — for consumption, for hydroelectric purposes or as sewers — while others carry
other services such as telecommunications cables. There are even tunnels designed as
wildlife crossings for European badgers and other endangered species . Some secret tunnels
have also been made as a method of entrance or escape from an area, such as the Cu Chi Tunnels or
the tunnels connecting the Gaza Strip to Egypt . Some tunnels are not for transport at all but
are fortifications, for example Mittelwerk and Cheyenne Mountain .

In the United Kingdom a pedestrian tunnel or other underpass beneath a road is called a subway .
This term was used in the past in the United States , but now refers to underground rapid transit
systems. The central part of a rapid transit network is usually built in tunnels. To allow
non-level crossings, some lines run in deeper tunnels than others. Rail stations with much
traffic usually provide pedestrian tunnels from one platform to another, though others use
bridges





Geotechnical investigation

Main article: Geotechnical investigation

It is essential that any tunnel project starts with a comprehensive investigation of ground
conditions. The results of the investigation will allow proper choice of machinery and
methods for excavation and ground support, and will reduce the risk of encountering
unforeseen ground conditions. In the early stages, the horizontal and vertical alignment
will be optimized to make use of the best ground and water conditions.

In some cases, conventional desk and site studies will not produce sufficient information to
assess, for example, the blocky nature of rocks, the exact location of fault zones, or
stand-up times of softer ground. This may be a particular concern in large diameter tunnels.
To overcome these problems, a pilot tunnel, or drift, may be driven ahead of the main drive.
This smaller diameter tunnel will be easier to support when unexpected conditions occur, and
will be incorporated in the final tunnel. Alternatively, horizontal boreholes may
sometimes be used ahead of the advancing tunnel face.

Cut-and-cover constructions of the Paris MÃ©tro in France

Tunnels are dug in various types of materials, from soft clay to hard rock, and the method of
excavation depends on the ground conditions.

Cut-and-cover



Cut-and-cover is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a trench is
excavated and roofed over. A strong overhead support system is required to carry the load of
the covering material, roads, streets or other transportation systems.

    Two basic forms of cut-and-cover tunnelling are available:

    - Bottom-up method : A trench is excavated, with ground support as necessary, and the
    tunnel is constructed within. The tunnel may be of in situ concrete, precast concrete,
    precast arches, corrugated steel arches and such, with brickwork used in early days. The
    trench is then backfilled, with precautions regarding balancing compaction of the
    backfill material, and the surface is reinstated.

    

    - Top-down method : In this method, side support walls and capping beams are constructed
    from ground level, using slurry walling, contiguous bored piles, or some other method. A
    shallow excavation is then made to allow the tunnel roof to be constructed using precast
    beams or in situ concrete. The surface is then reinstated except for access openings.
    This allows early reinstatement of roadways, services and other surface features.
    Excavation machinery is then lowered into the access openings, and the main excavation
    is carried out under the permanent tunnel roof, followed by constructing the base slab.

    



Shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type (if under water, of the immersed-tube
type), while deep tunnels are excavated, often using a tunnelling shield . For intermediate
levels, both methods are possible.

Large cut-and-cover boxes are often used for underground metro stations, such as Canary
Wharf tube station in London. This construction form generally has two levels, which allows
economical arrangements for ticket hall, station platforms, passenger access and
emergency egress, ventilation and smoke control, staff rooms, and equipment rooms. The
interior of Canary Wharf station has been likened to an underground cathedral, owing to the
sheer size of the excavation. This contrasts with most traditional stations on London
Underground , where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access.

Boring machines

Image: http://en.wikipedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png A tunnel
boring machine that was used at Yucca Mountain , Nevada , United States

Tunnel boring machines (TBMs) and associated back-up systems can be used to highly automate
the entire tunneling process. There are a variety of TBMs that can operate in a variety of
conditions, from hard rock to soft water-bearing ground. Some types of TBMs, bentonite
slurry and earth-pressure balance machines, have pressurised compartments at the front
end, allowing them to be used in difficult conditions below the water table . This pressurizes
the ground ahead of the TBM cutter head to balance the water pressure. The operators work in
normal air pressure behind the pressurised compartment, but may occasionally have to enter
that compartment to renew or repair the cutters. This requires special precautions, such as
local ground treatment or halting the TBM at a position free from water. Despite these
difficulties, TBMs are now preferred to the older method of tunneling in compressed air, with
an air lock/decompression chamber some way back from the TBM, which required operators to
work in high pressure and go through decompression procedures at the end of their shifts, much
like divers.

Until recently the largest TBM built was used to bore the Green Heart Tunnel (Dutch: Tunnel
Groene Hart) as part of the HSL-Zuid in the Netherlands. It had a diameter of 14.87 m. [ 1 ]

Nowadays even larger machines exist, for example the machines used for the Madrid M30
ringroad , Spain , and the Chong Ming tunnels in Shanghai , China . The TBM used for digging the 57
km Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland has a diameter of about 9 m. All of these machines were
built at least partly by Herrenknecht .

NATM



The New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) was developed in the 1960s. The main idea of this
method is to use the geological stress of the surrounding rock mass to stabilize the tunnel
itself. Based on geotechnical measurements, an optimal cross section is computed. The
excavation is immediately protected by thin shotcrete , just behind the excavation. This
creates a natural load-bearing ring, which minimizes the rock's deformation .

By special monitoring the NATM method is very flexible, even at surprising changes of the
geomechanical rock consistency during the tunneling work. The measured rock properties
lead to appropriate tools for tunnel strengthening . In the last decades also soft ground
excavations up to 10 km became usual.

Pipe jacking



Pipe Jacking , also known as pipejacking or pipe-jacking , is a method of tunnel construction
where hydraulic jacks are used to push specially made pipes through the ground behind a tunnel
boring machine or shield. This technique is commonly used to create tunnels under existing
structures, such as roads or railways.

Underwater tunnels

Main article: Undersea tunnel

There are also several approaches to underwater tunnels, the two most common being bored
tunnels or immersed tubes . Submerged floating tunnels are another approach that has not been
constructed.

Other



    Other tunneling methods include:

    - Drilling and blasting

    

    - Slurry- shield machine

    

    - Wall-cover construction method.

    



Choice of tunnels vs. bridges



For water crossings, a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge.
Navigational considerations may limit the use of high bridges or drawbridge spans
intersecting with shipping channels, necessitating a tunnel.

Bridges usually require a larger footprint on each shore than tunnels. In areas with
expensive real estate, such as Manhattan and urban Hong Kong , this is a strong factor in
tunnels' favor. Boston's Big Dig project replaced elevated roadways with a tunnel system to
increase traffic capacity, hide traffic, reclaim land, redecorate, and reunite the city
with the waterfront.

The 1934 Queensway Road Tunnel under the River Mersey at Liverpool, was chosen over a
massively high bridge for defence reasons. It was feared aircraft could destroy a bridge in
times of war. Maintenance costs of a massive bridge to allow the world's largest ships
navigate under was considered higher than a tunnel. Similar conclusions were met for the 1971
Kingsway Tunnel under the River Mersey.

Examples of water-crossing tunnels built instead of bridges include the Holland Tunnel and
Lincoln Tunnel between New Jersey and Manhattan in New York City , and the Elizabeth River
tunnels between Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia , the 1934 River Mersey road Queensway
Tunnel and the Westerschelde tunnel , Zeeland, Netherlands.

Other reasons for choosing a tunnel instead of a bridge include avoiding difficulties with
tides, weather and shipping during construction (as in the 51.5 km Channel Tunnel ),
aesthetic reasons (preserving the above-ground view, landscape, and scenery), and also for
weight capacity reasons (it may be more feasible to build a tunnel than a sufficiently strong
bridge).

Some water crossings are a mixture of bridges and tunnels, such as the Denmark to Sweden link
and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in the eastern United States .

There are particular hazards with tunnels, especially from vehicle fires when combustion
gases can asphyxiate users, as happened at the Gotthard Road Tunnel in Switzerland in 2001.
One of the worst railway disasters ever, the Balvano train disaster , was caused by a train
stalling in the Armi tunnel in Italy in 1944, killing 426 passengers.

Variant tunnel types



Double-deck tunnel



Some tunnels are double-deck, for example the two major segments of the San Francisco –
Oakland Bay Bridge (completed in 1936) are linked by a double-deck tunnel, once the largest
diameter tunnel in the world. At construction this was a combination bidirectional rail and
truck pathway on the lower deck with automobiles above, now converted to one-way road vehicle
traffic on each deck.

A recent double-decker tunnel with both decks for motor vehicles is the Fuxing Road Tunnel in
Shanghai , China. Cars travel on the two-lane upper deck and heavier vehicles on the
single-lane lower.

Multipurpose tunnel are tunnels that have more than one purpose. The SMART Tunnel in Malaysia
is the first multipurpose tunnel in the world, as it is used both to control traffic and flood in
Kuala Lumpur .

Short tunnels



Artificial tunnels

century Dark Gate in Esztergom , Hungary

Overbridges can sometimes be built by covering a road or river or railway with brick or still
arches, and then levelling the surface with earth. In railway parlance, a surface-level
track which has been built or covered over is normally called a covered way.

Snow sheds are a kind of artificial tunnel built to protect a railway from avalanches of snow.
Similarly the Stanwell Park , New South Wales steel tunnel , on the South Coast railway line ,
protects the line from rockfalls.

Common utility ducts are man-made tunnels created to carry two or more utility lines
underground. Through co-location of different utilities in one tunnel, organizations are
able to reduce the costs of building and maintaining utilities.

Hazards



Owing to the enclosed space of a tunnel, fires can have very serious effects on users. The main
dangers are gas and smoke production, with low concentrations of carbon monoxide being
highly toxic. Fires killed 11 people in the Gotthard tunnel fire of 2001 for example, all of the
victims succumbing to smoke and gas inhalation. Over 400 passengers died in the Balvano train
disaster in Italy in 1944, when the locomotive halted in a long tunnel. Carbon monoxide
poisoning was the main cause of the horrifying death rate. Fires have also occurred in the
Channel Tunnel , leading to great delays for users.

Examples of tunnels



In history

    

    - World's oldest underwater tunnel is rumored to be the Terelek kaya tÃŒneli under
    KÄ±zÄ±l River , a little south of the towns of Boyabat and Duragan in Turkey .
    Estimated to have been built more than 2000 years ago (possibly 5000) it is assumed to have
    had a defence purpose.

    

    - The qanat or kareez of Persia is a water management system used to provide a reliable
    supply of water to human settlements or for irrigation in hot, arid and semi-arid
    climates. The oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of Gonabad which after
    2700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people. Its
    main well depth is more than 360 m (1,200 ft ) and its length is 45 km (28 mi ).

    Interior of the Thames Tunnel , London , United Kingdom , mid 19th century

    - The Eupalinian aqueduct on the island of Samos ( North Aegean , Greece ). Built in 520 BC by
    the ancient Greek engineer Eupalinos of Megara . Eupalinos organised the work so that the
    tunnel was begun from both sides of mount Kastro. The two teams advanced simultaneously
    and met in the middle with excellent accuracy, something that was extremely difficult in
    that time. The aqueduct was of utmost defensive importance, since it ran underground and
    it was not easily found by an enemy who could otherwise cut off the water supply to
    Pythagoreion , the ancient capital of Samos . The tunnel's existence was recorded by
    Herodotus (as was the mole and harbour, and the third wonder of the island, the great
    temple to Hera, thought by many to be the largest in the Greek world). The precise location
    of the tunnel was only re-established in the 19th century by German archaeologists. The
    tunnel proper is 1,030 m (3,400 ft) long and visitors can still enter it Eupalinos tunnel .

    

    - The Via Flaminia , an important Roman road , penetrated the Furlo pass in the Apennines
    through a tunnel which emperor Vespasian had ordered built in 76-77. A modern road, the SS
    3 Flaminia, still uses this tunnel, which had an precursor dating back to the 3rd century
    BC; remnants of this earlier tunnel (one of the first road tunnels) are also still
    visible.

    

    - Sapperton Canal Tunnel on the Thames and Severn Canal in England , dug through hills,
    which opened in 1789, was 3.5 km (2.2 mi) long and allowed boat transport of coal and other
    goods. Above it runs the Sapperton Long Tunnel which carries the "Golden Valley" railway
    line between Swindon and Gloucester .

    

    - The 1796 Stoddart Tunnel in Chapel-en-le-Frith in Derbyshire is reputed to be the
    oldest rail tunnel in the world. Rail wagons were horse drawn.

    

    - The tunnel created for the first true steam locomotive, the Penydarren locomotive,
    built by Richard Trevithick . The locomotive made an historic journey from Penydarren to
    Abercynon in 1804. Part of this tunnel can still be seen at Pentrebach , Merthyr Tydfil .
    This is arguably the oldest railway tunnel in the world, for self-propelled steam
    engines on rails.

    

    - The Montgomery Bell Tunnel in Tennessee, a 290 foot (88 metres) long, 15 foot wide by 8
    foot high water diversion tunnel to power a water wheel, was built by slave labor in 1819,
    being the first full-scale tunnel in North America.

    

    - Crown Street Station , Liverpool , 1829. Built by George Stephenson , a single track
    tunnel 291 yards long was bored from Edge Hill to Crown Street to serve the world's first
    passenger railway station. The station was abandoned in 1836 being too far from
    Liverpool city centre, with the area converted for freight use. Closed down in 1972, the
    tunnel is disused. However it is the oldest rail tunnel running under streets in the
    world. [1]

    

    - The 1.26 mile (2.03 km) 1830 Wapping Tunnel in Liverpool, England, was the first rail
    tunnel bored under a metropolis. Currently disused since 1972. Having two tracks, the
    tunnel runs from Edge Hill in the east of the city to the south end Liverpool docks being
    used only for freight. The tunnel is still in excellent condition and is being considered
    for reuse by Merseyrail rapid transit rail system, with maybe an underground station cut
    into the tunnel. The river portal is opposite the new Liverpool Arena being ideal for a
    serving station. If reused it will be the oldest used underground rail tunnel in the world
    and oldest part of any underground metro system.

    

    - 1836, Lime St Station tunnel, Liverpool. A two track rail tunnel, 1.13 miles (1,811 m)
    long was bored under a metropolis from Edge Hill in the east of the city to Lime Street. In
    the 1880s the tunnel was converted to a deep cutting four tracks wide. The only occurrence
    of a tunnel being removed. A very short section of the original tunnel still exists at Edge
    Hill station making this the oldest rail tunnel in the world still in use, and the oldest in
    use under a street, albeit only one street and one building.

    

    - Box Tunnel in England, which opened in 1841, was the longest railway tunnel in the world
    at the time of construction. It was dug and has a length of 2.9 km (1.8 mi).

    

    - The 0.75 mile long 1842 Shildon tunnel near Darlington, England, is the oldest sizable
    tunnel in the world still in use under a settlement.

    

    - The Thames Tunnel , built by Marc Isambard Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel and
    opened in 1843, was the first underwater tunnel and the first to use a tunnelling shield .
    Originally used as a foot-tunnel, it was a part of the East London Line of the London
    Underground until 2007, being the oldest section of the system. From 2010 the tunnel
    becomes a part of the London Overground system.

    

    - The 2.07 miles (3.34 km) Waterloo Tunnel in Liverpool , opened in 1849, was bored under a
    metropolis. Initially used only for rail freight and later freight and passengers
    serving the Liverpool ship liner terminal, the tunnel runs from Edge Hill in the east of
    the city to the north end Liverpool docks. Used until 1972 it is still in excellent
    condition, being considered for reuse by the Merseyrail rapid transit rail system.
    Stations being cut into the tunnel are being considered. Also, reuse by a monorail system
    from the proposed Liverpool Waters redevelopment of Liverpool's Central Docks has been
    proposed.

    

    - The oldest sections of the London Underground were built using the cut-and-cover
    method in the 1860s. The Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City, Circle and District lines
    were the first to prove the success of a metro or subway system. Dating from 1863, Baker
    Street station is the oldest underground station in the world.

    

    - The 1882 Col de Tende Road Tunnel , at 3182 metres long, was one of the first long road
    tunnels under a pass, running between France and Italy.

    

    - The Mersey Railway tunnel opened in 1886 running from Liverpool to Birkenhead under the
    River Mersey. By 1892 the extensions on land from Birkenhead Park station to Liverpool
    Central Low level station gave a tunnel 3.12 miles (5029 m) in length. The under river
    section is 0.75 miles in length, being the longest underwater tunnel in world in January
    1886.

    

    - The rail Severn Tunnel was opened in late 1886, at 4 miles 624 yd (7,008 m) long, although
    only 2¼ miles (3.62 km) of the tunnel is actually under the river. The tunnel replaced the
    Mersey Railway tunnel's longest under water record, which it held for less than a year.

    

    - James Greathead , in constructing the City & South London Railway tunnel beneath the
    Thames, opened in 1890, brought together three key elements of tunnel construction
    under water: 1) shield method of excavation; 2) permanent cast iron tunnel lining; 3)
    construction in a compressed air environment to inhibit water flowing through soft
    ground material into the tunnel heading. [ 2 ]

    

    - St. Clair Tunnel , also opened later in 1890, linked the elements of the Greathead
    tunnels on a larger scale. [ 2 ]

    

    - The 1927 Holland Tunnel was the first underwater tunnel designed for automobiles. This
    fact required a novel ventilation system .

Notable

    

    - The FredhÃ€lls Tunnel in Stockholm , Sweden , and the New Elbe Tunnel in Hamburg ,
    Germany , both with around 150,000 vehicles a day, two of the most trafficked tunnels in
    the world.

    

    - The Lincoln Tunnel between New Jersey and New York is one of the busiest vehicular
    tunnels in America, at 120,000 vehicles/day, although the Central Artery Tunnel in
    Boston probably has around 200,000 vehicles/day.

    

    - Gerrards Cross tunnel in Britain is notable in that it is being built over a railway
    cutting that was dug in the early part of the 20th Century. Thus, arguably, making it the
    tunnel longest in construction by the cut and cover method. When complete a branch of the
    Tesco supermarket chain will occupy the space above the railway.

    

    - Williamson's tunnels in Liverpool , built by a wealthy eccentric are probably the
    largest underground folly in the world.

    

    - New York City Water Tunnel No. 3 [2] , started in 1970, has an expected completion date of
    2020.

    

    - The Chicago Deep Tunnel Project is a network of 109 mi (175 km) of tunnels designed to
    reduce flooding in the Chicago area . Started in the mid 1970s, the project is due to be
    completed in 2019.

    

    - Moffat Tunnel in Colorado straddles the Continental Divide . The tunnel is 6.2 mi (10.0
    km) long and at 9,239 ft (2,816 m) above sea level is the highest railroad tunnel in the
    United States .

    

    - The Fenghuoshan tunnel on Qinghai-Tibet railway is the world's highest railway
    tunnel, about 4,905 m (16,093 ft) above sea level.

    

    - The La Linea Tunnel in Colombia , is the longest mountain tunnel in South America. It
    crosses beneath a mountain at 4,500 m (14,764 ft) above sea level with six lanes and it has a
    parallel emergency tunnel. The tunnel is subject to serious groundwater pressure. The
    tunnel, which is currently under construction, will link Bogota and its urban area with
    the coffee-growing region and with the main port on the Colombian Pacific coast.

    

    - The HonningsvÃ¥g Tunnel (4,443 m (14,580 ft) long) on European route E69 in Norway is
    the world's northernmost road tunnel, except for mines (which exist on Svalbard ).

    



Multiple headings



Long tunnels get increasingly slow to build as they get longer. A solution if the geography
suits is to have intermediate access shaft so that excavation can take place on several faces.
Surveyors have a good record of making the separate sections meet with errors in alignment of
just a few inches. An exception would be one of the hundred tunnels on the Kalka-Shimla Railway
.

Other uses



Excavation techniques, as well as the construction of underground bunkers and other
habitable areas, are often associated with military use during armed conflict , or civilian
responses to threat of attack. The use of tunnels for mining is called drift mining . One of the
strangest uses of a tunnel was for the storage of chemical weapons [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [3] .

Natural tunnel

    

    - Natural Tunnel State Park (Virginia, USA) features an 850 feet (259 m) natural tunnel,
    really a limestone cave, that has been used as a railroad tunnel since 1890.

    

    - Punarjani Guha Kerala, India. Hindus believe that crawling through the tunnel (which
    they believe was created by a Hindu god) from one end to the other will wash away all of
    one’s sins and thus attain rebirth, although only men are permitted to crawl through
    the cave.

    



Snow tunnels are created by voles, chipmunks and other rodents for protection and access to
food sources. Larger versions are created by humans, usually for fun.

For more information regarding tunnels built by animals, see Burrow

Temporary Way



During construction of a tunnel it is often convenient to install a temporary railway
particularly to remove spoil. This temporary railway is often narrow gauge so that it can be
double track, which facilitates the operation of empty and loaded trains at the same time. The
temporary way is replaced by the permanent way at completion, thus explaining the term
Perway.

Enlargement



The vehicles using a tunnel can outgrow it, requiring replacement or enlargement. The
original single line Gib Tunnel near Mittagong was replaced with a double line tunnel, with
the original tunnel used for growing mushrooms. [ citation needed ] The Rhyndaston Tunnel was
enlarged using a borrowed Tunnel Boring Machine so as to be able to take ISO containers .

The 1836 Lime Street two track 1 mile tunnel from Edge Hill to Lime Street in Liverpool was
totally removed, apart from a short 50 metre section at Edge Hill. Four tracks were required.
The tunnel was converted into a very deep 4 track open cutting. However, short larger 4 track
tunnels were left in some parts of the run. Train services were not interrupted as the work
progressed. Photos of the work in progress: [4] [5] There are other occurrences of tunnels
being replaced by open cuts, for example, the Auburn Tunnel .

Dubai Tallest Building



Image:
http://bp3.blogger.com/_1EqNyPLtUIo/R9rh-lvF6sI/AAAAAAAAAAw/8deyMXZCmxo/s400/250px-Burj_Dubai.jpg

Burj Dubai ( Arabic : ØšØ±Ø¬ Ø¯ØšÙŠ‎ "Dubai Tower") is a supertall skyscraper
currently under construction in Dubai , United Arab Emirates . When it is completed in 2009,
[1] it is predicted to be the tallest man-made structure in the world . Scheduled for occupancy
in September 2009, the building is part of a 2 km² (0.8 sq mi ) development called ' Downtown
Dubai ' and is located at the "First Interchange" (aka "Defence Roundabout ") along Sheikh
Zayed Road at Doha Street.

The tower's architect is Adrian Smith [4] who worked with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM)
until 2006. [5] SOM is the architecture and engineering firm in charge of the project. [4] The
primary builder is Samsung Engineering & Construction , along with Besix and Arabtec . [6]
Turner Construction Company was chosen as the construction manager. [7] Third party peer
review has been performed by CBM Engineers .

The total budget for the Burj Dubai project is about $4.1 billion USD and for the entire new
'Downtown Dubai', $20 billion USD.





Height



Current height

As of 5 February 2008 , Burj Dubai has reached a height of 604.9 m (1,985 ft), with 159 completed
floors. [8]

Burj Dubai's last three milestones will be to surpass 609.9 m (2,001 ft), the height of the
Petronius oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico which is (depending on criteria) the tallest
freestanding structure in the world; then 628.8 m (2,063 ft), the height of the KVLY-TV Mast in
North Dakota , United States to become the world's tallest structure and to pass the Warsaw
radio mast in KonstantynÃ³w near GÄ…bin , Poland (646.4 m (2,121 ft) until it collapsed
in 1991) to become the world's tallest structure of any type ever built.



Timeline of events

September 21 , 2004 Emaar contractors begin construction of Burj Dubai.

February 2007 Burj Dubai surpasses the Sears Tower as the building with the most floors .

May 13 , 2007 Burj Dubai sets record for vertical concrete pumping on any building at 452 m
(1,483 ft), surpassing the 449.2 m (1,474 ft) to which concrete was pumped during the
construction of Taipei 101 . [9]

July 21 , 2007 Burj Dubai becomes the tallest building on Earth surpassing Taipei 101 which
stands at a height of 509.2 m (1,671 ft). [8] The previous day, the head of the Council on Tall
Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), Antony Wood, had confirmed that it "surpassed the
height of Taipei 101 structurally (concrete)." [10] However, he also added "We will not
classify it as a building until it is complete, clad and at least partially open for business to
avoid things like the Ryungyong [ sic ] project. Taipei 101 is thus officially the world's
tallest until that happens."

August 12 , 2007 Burj Dubai surpassed the height of the Sears' Tower antenna which stands at a
height of 527.3 m (1,730 ft).

September 3 , 2007 Burj Dubai becomes the second-tallest freestanding structure,
surpassing the 540 m (1,772 ft) Ostankino Tower in Moscow .

September 12 , 2007 At 555.3 m (1,822 ft), Burj Dubai becomes the world's tallest freestanding
structure on land, surpassing the CN Tower in Toronto . [11]



Current records

Note: As indicated above, the CTBUH does not recognise records for buildings still under
construction, therefore some of those records are unofficial:

Tallest freestanding structure on land: 604.9 m (1,985 ft) (previously CN Tower - 553.3 m
(1,815 ft))

Building with most floors: 159 (previously Sears Tower / World Trade Center - 110)

Vertical concrete pumping (for a building): 601.0 m (1,972 ft) (previously Taipei 101 - 449.2
m (1,474 ft))

Vertical concrete pumping (for any construction): 601.0 m (1,972 ft) (previously Riva del
Garda Hydroelectric Power Plant - 532 m (1,745 ft) [12] )



Projected height



Projected height of the completed Burj Dubai, compared to the height of some other well known
tall buildings.

The projected final height of Burj Dubai is officially being kept a secret due to competition
from other buildings under construction or proposed; however, figures released by a
contractor on the project have suggested a height of around 818 m (2,684 ft). [13] Based on this
height, the total number of habitable floors is expected to be around 162. However, the Burj
Dubai's construction manager, Greg Sang, has said only that the final height would be greater
than 700 m (2,297 ft), and that it would be the world's tallest free-standing structure when
completed. [14]



History of height increases

Though unconfirmed, Burj Dubai has been rumoured to have undergone several height increases
since its inception. Originally proposed as a virtual clone of the 560 m (1,837 ft) Grollo
Tower proposal for Melbourne , Australia's Docklands waterfront development , the tower was
redesigned with an original design by Skidmore Owings and Merrill seen above and discussed
below. This design should put it at approximately 705 m (2,313 ft). Contradictory
information abounds regarding the official height of the building, which is to be expected,
considering the building seeks to acquire the designation as the world's tallest structure
upon completion in 2009. One website [15] mentions a rumoured final height of 916 m (3,005 ft)
in a September 28 , 2006 posting, but this is contradicted by a September 20 , 2006 article
listing a height over 940 m (3,084 ft). [16]

The design architect, Adrian Smith, felt that the upper-most section of the building did not
culminate elegantly with the rest of the structure, so he sought and received approval to
increase it to the currently planned height. It has been explicitly stated that this change
did not include any added floors, [17] which is fitting with Smith's attempts to make the crown
more slender. However, the top of the tower will be a steel frame structure, unlike the lower
portion's reinforced concrete . The developer, Emaar , has stated this steel section may be
extended to beat any other tower to the title of tallest; however, once the tower is complete
the height cannot be changed.



Competition with other projects

Several other major projects in the region may vie for the title of tallest structure. These
other projects are in various states of planning and/or construction.

One of Burj Dubai's potential competitors is the proposed Murjan Tower , in Manama , Bahrain .
Designed by the Danish architects Henning Larsens Tegnestue A/S , it is expected to be 1,022 m
(3,353 ft) in height with 200 floors. [18]

Also potentially competing with Burj Dubai is the proposed 1,001 m (3,284 ft) Burj Mubarak
al-Kabir to be erected in Kuwait as part of a massive development project called Madinat
al-Hareer (City of Silk). The project also includes an Olympic stadium , residences, hotels,
and retail facilities. However, the project may take 25 years to complete. [19]

Another proposed tower which may surpass the height of Burj Dubai, is Al Burj , on a site near
Dubai Marina . Speculation has suggested various heights between 700 m (2,297 ft) and 1,200 m
(3,937 ft), but the developer is keeping the final height tightly under wraps. If built, it
will be only 22 km (14 mi ) from the Burj Dubai site.



Architecture and design

The tower is being constructed by a South Korean company, Samsung Engineering & Construction
[20] which also built the Petronas Twin Towers and the Taipei 101. The tower is designed by
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, who also designed the Sears Tower in Chicago and the Freedom
Tower in New York City , among numerous other famous high-rises. The building resembles the
bundled tube form of the Sears Tower, but is not a tube structure. The design of Burj Dubai is
reminiscent of the Frank Lloyd Wright vision for The Illinois , a mile high skyscraper
designed for Chicago, Illinois . Burj Dubai is expected to rise to 150% of the height of the
Sears Tower. Emaar has also engaged GHD [21] , an international multidisciplinary
consulting firm, to assist with the design, review and assessment involved in the
construction process.



Supertall cross-section comparisons

The design of Burj Dubai is ostensibly derived from the patterning systems embodied in
Islamic architecture , with the triple-lobed footprint of the building based on an
abstracted version of the desert flower hymenocallis native to the region. The tower is
composed of three elements arranged around a central core. As the tower rises from the flat
desert base, setbacks occur at each element in an upward spiralling pattern, decreasing the
cross section of the tower as it reaches toward the sky. At the top, the central core emerges and
is sculpted to form a finishing spire. A Y-shaped floor plan maximizes views of the Persian
Gulf . Viewed from above or from the base, the form also evokes the onion domes of Islamic
architecture. During the design process, engineers rotated the building 120 degrees from
its original layout to reduce stress from prevailing winds.

The exterior cladding of Burj Dubai will consist of 142,000 m² (1,528,000 sq ft) of
reflective glazing, and aluminium and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with
vertical tubular fins. The cladding system is designed to withstand Dubai's extreme summer
temperatures.

The interior will be decorated by Giorgio Armani . An Armani Hotel (the first of its kind) will
occupy the lower 37 floors. Floors 45 through 108 will have 700 private apartments on 64 floors
(which, according to the developer, sold out within eight hours of going on sale). An outdoor
zero-entry swimming pool will be located on the 78th floor of the tower. Corporate offices and
suites will fill most of the remaining floors, except for a 123rd floor lobby and 124th floor
(about 440 m (1,444 ft)) indoor/outdoor observation deck . The spire - itself over 200 m (700
ft) tall - will hold communications equipment.

It will also feature the world's fastest elevator , rising and descending at 18 m/s (59 ft/s).
[22] The world's current fastest elevator (in the Taipei 101) travels at 16.83 m/s (55.2
ft/s). Engineers had considered installing the world's first triple-decker elevators, but
the final design calls for double-deck elevators . [1] A total of 56 elevators will be
installed that can each carry 42 people at a time. [4]

Over 45,000 m³ (58,900 cu yd ) of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes (120,000 ST
/110,000 LT ) were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192
piles buried more than 50 m (164 ft) deep. [1] When completed, Burj Dubai's construction will
have used 330,000 m³ (431,600 cu yd) of concrete and 39,000 tonnes (43,000 ST/38,000 LT) of
steel rebar (enough to extend over a quarter of the way around the world if laid end-to-end);
and construction will have taken 22 million man hours. [4]



Purpose

Burj Dubai has been designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development
that will include 30,000 homes, nine hotels such as the Burj Dubai Lake Hotel & Serviced
Apartments , 0.03 km² (0.01 sq mi) of parkland, at least 19 residential towers, the Dubai Mall
, and the 0.12 km² (0.05 sq mi) man-made Burj Dubai Lake. Burj Dubai will cost US$ 800 million to
build and the entire 2 km² (0.77 sq mi) development will cost around US$ 20 billion.

The silvery glass-sheathed concrete building will give the title of Earth's tallest
free-standing structure to the Middle East — a title not held by the region since 1311 AD when
Lincoln Cathedral in England surpassed the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza , which had held
the title for almost four millennia .

The decision to build Burj Dubai is reportedly based on the government's decision to
diversify from a trade-based economy to one that is service- and tourism-oriented.
According to officials, it is necessary for projects like Burj Dubai to be built in the city to
garner more international recognition, and hence investment. "He [ Sheikh Mohammed bin
Rashid Al Maktoum ] wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational," said
Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at Nakheel Properties . [23]



Construction



Burj Dubai in December 2007

The primary structural system of the Burj Dubai is reinforced concrete. As construction of
the tower progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to vertically pump the thousands of
cubic metres of concrete that are required. The previous record for pumping concrete on any
project was set during the extension of the Riva del Garda Hydroelectric Power Plant in Italy
in 1994, when concrete was pumped to a height of 532 m (1,745 ft). Burj Dubai now holds this
record as of August 19 , 2007 , as it has a height of 536.1 m (1,759 ft), to hold the record for
concrete pumping on any project; and as of November 8 , 2007 concrete was pumped to a delivery
height of 601 m (1,972 ft). [24] .

Special mixes of concrete are made to withstand the extreme pressures of the massive weight of
the tower; each batch of concrete is tested and checked to see whether it can withstand certain
pressures. The head of Concrete Quality Checking on the Burj Dubai project is Alam Feroze, who
is in charge of concrete on the whole project. The concrete pumps, pipelines and booms are
provided by Putzmeister AG, of Aichtal , Germany .

As the consistency of the concrete on the project is essential, it was difficult to create a
concrete that could withstand the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it, but also to
withstand Gulf temperatures that can reach 50 °C (122 °F ). To combat this problem, the
concrete is not poured during the day. Instead, ice is added to the mixture and it is poured at
night when it is cooler and the humidity is higher. A cooler concrete mixture cures evenly
throughout and therefore is less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks
could put the whole project in jeopardy.



Labour controversy

Further information: Human rights in the United Arab Emirates

Burj Dubai is being built primarily by immigrant engineers and workers from Pakistan , India ,
Bangladesh , China and the Philippines . [25] Press reports indicate that skilled carpenters
at the site earn US $ 7.60 ( £ 4.34)/day, and laborers earn US$4.00 (£2.84). [25] [26] Unions
were forbidden in the United Arab Emirates up until recently, when the government announced
steps to allow construction unions. [27] On March 21 , 2006 , workers upset over low wages and
poor working conditions rioted, damaging cars, offices, computers, and construction
equipment. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused approximately US$1m
(£488k) in damage. Most workers returned the following day but refused to work. Workers
building a new terminal at Dubai International Airport also joined that day's strike action .

The United Arab Emirates dirham 's close connection with the low US Dollar, and the increased
cost-of-living in the region, has made it increasingly difficult for immigrant
construction workers to survive on their wages. An offer by the UAE government in June 2007 to
fly home illegal immigrant workers free-of-charge, with no questions asked, was met with
overwhelming demand, further threatening the supply of workers on the Burj Dubai and other
Dubai construction projects. Posted by

What Is Construction

In the fields of architecture and civil engineering , construction is a process that consists
of the building or assembling of infrastructure . Far from being a single activity , large
scale construction is a feat of multitasking . Normally the job is managed by the project
manager and supervised by the construction manager , design engineer , construction
engineer or project architect .

For the successful execution of a project , effective planning is essential. Those involved
with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider the
environmental impact of the job, the successful scheduling, budgeting , site safety ,
availability of materials, logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction
delays , preparing tender documents , etc. Posted by

Beam (structure)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation , search



A statically determinate beam, bending under an evenly distributed load.

A beam is a structural element that carries load primarily in bending (flexure). Beams
generally carry vertical gravitational forces but can also be used to carry horizontal loads
(i.e. loads due to an earthquake or wind). The loads carried by a beam are transferred to
columns , walls , or girders , which then transfer the force to adjacent structural
compression members . In Light frame construction the joists rest on the beam.

Beams are characterized by their profile (the shape of their cross-section), their length,
and their material . In contemporary construction , beams are typically made of steel ,
reinforced concrete , or wood . One of the most common types of steel beam is the I-beam or wide-
flange beam (also known as a "universal beam" or, for stouter sections, a "universal
column"). This is commonly used in steel-frame buildings and bridges . Other common beam
profiles are the C-channel , the hollow structural section beam, the pipe , and the angle .

[ edit ] Structural Characteristics

Internally, beams experience compressive , tensile and shear stresses as a result of the
loads applied to them. Typically, under gravity loads, the original length of the beam is
slightly reduced to enclose a smaller radius arc at the top of the beam, resulting in
compression, while the same original beam length at the bottom of the beam is slightly
stretched to enclose a larger radius arc, and so is under tension. The same original length of
the middle of the beam, generally halfway between the top and bottom, is the same as the radial
arc of bending, and so it is under neither compression nor tension, and defines the neutral
axis (dotted line in the beam figure). Above the supports, the beam is exposed to shear stress .
There are some reinforced concrete beams that are entirely in compression. These beams are
known as prestressed concrete beams, and are fabricated to produce a compression more than
the expected tension under loading conditions. High strength steel tendons are stretched
while the beam is cast over them. Then, when the concrete has begun to cure, the tendons are
released and the beam is immediately under eccentric axial loads. This eccentric loading
creates an internal moment, and, in turn, increases the moment carrying capacity of the beam.
They are commonly used on highway bridges.

The primary tool for structural analysis of beams is the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation .
Other mathematical methods for determining the deflection of beams include "method of
virtual work " and the "slope deflection method". Engineers are interested in determining
deflections because the beam may be in direct contact with a brittle material such as glass.
Beam deflections are also minimised for aesthetic reasons. A visibly sagging beam, though
structurally safe, is unsightly and to be avoided. A stiffer beam (high modulus of elasticity
and high second moment of area ) produces less deflection. Mathematical methods for
determining the beam forces (internal forces of the beam and the forces that are imposed on the
beam support) include the " moment distribution method", the force or flexibility method and
the matrix stiffness method .



[ edit ] General Shapes



Diagram of stiffness of a simple square beam (A) and I-beam (B). The I-beam flange sections are
three times further apart than the solid beam's upper and lower halves. The second moment of
inertia of the I-beam is nine times that of the square beam of equal cross section (I-beam web
ignored for simplification)

Mostly the beams have rectangular cross sections in reinforced concrete buildings, but the
most efficient cross-section is an I-shaped beam. The fact that most of the material is placed
away from the neutral axis (axis of symmetry in case of I beams) increases the second moment of
area of the beam which in turn increases the stiffness.

An I-beam is only the most efficient shape in one direction of bending: up and down looking at
the profile as an I. If the beam is bent side to side , it functions as an H and is less efficient.
The most efficient shape for both directions in 2D is a box (a square shell) however the most
efficient shape for bending in any direction is a cylindrical shell or tube. But, for
unidirectional bending, the I beam is king.

Efficiency means that for the same cross sectional area (Volume of beam per length) subjected
to the same loading conditions, the beam deflects less.

Other shapes, like L (angles), C (Channels) or tubes, are also used in construction when there
are special requirements. Posted by
