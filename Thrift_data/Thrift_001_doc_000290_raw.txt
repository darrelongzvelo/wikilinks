Demographic Data & Construction and Interpretation of Related Graphs

Posted: November 30, 2010 in Assignment 8

0

The purpose of this post was to estimate the relationships and implications of demographic
data and in a way construct the worldâ€™s population and analyze the given countries as
much as we can and develop an idea of the population geography using the World Population Data
Sheet 2010. Throughout this blog there are mentioned many interesting definitions as age sex
graph of countries, age dependency ratio as well as details about different countries
population issues which were chosen by Kostjan & Adam. Â

Pic.1 -Earth is suffering from overpopulation & cannot stand for long on her feet.

    1. China and India have the largest populations in the world. Which of these two countries
    adds more people to its population annually? [ Calculate the numbers added by applying
    the rate of natural increase to the population of each country. Â  Hint: the rate is a
    percent ] Country Number of people added annually China 6.690((1338.1*0.5)/100) India
    17.832((1188.8*1,5)/100)

    - Â India adds more people to its population annually than China.

    



Â 2. What proportion of the worldâ€™s people live the following continents/regions
and what are the projected proportions by 2025 and 2050? Continets % Living today % By 2025 % By
2050 Asia Â  60.3(4157/6892*100) 59.7(4845/8108*100) 57.2(5424/9485*100) North
America Â  5(344/6892*100) 4.8(391/8108*100) 4.9(471/9485*100) Latin America Â 
8.4(585/6892*100) 8.2(668/8108*100) 7.7(729/9485*100) Europe Â  10.7(739/6892*100)
9.2(747/8108*100) 7.6(720/9485*100) Oceania Â  0.5(37/6892*100) 0.5(45/8108*100)

-Use the data above and Excel to construct a bar chart showing the regional distributions of
the worldâ€™s population for the current year, 2025, and 2050.



Image: http://annaact.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/chart.jpg?w=835&h=348&h=410

- What trends are reflected in the bar chart?

As shown in Graph 1 above, the trends that are reflected are Oceania slightly increases in
percentage of people by 2050, Europe decreases in percentage of population by 2050, Latin
America very slightly decreases in percentage by 2050, North America slightly increases in
percentage by 2050, and Asia decreases in percentage by 2050.

3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  What proportion of the worldâ€™s people live in less
developed countries (LDCs) and in more developed countries (MDCs) today? What proportion is
projected to live in LDCs and MDCs in 2025 and in 2050? Countries % of worldâ€™s
population today % of worldâ€™spopulation in 2025 % of worldâ€™s population in
2050 LDCs 82% 84% 86% MDCs 18% 16% 14%

Â  Me and my partner discussed about the data above and we came to the conclusion that in the
less developed countries, the percentage of people will increase by 2050, and in the more
developed countries, the percentage of population will decrease by 2050.Â 
Economically, it does not seem good that the population will increase in less developed
countries from todayâ€™s point of view, but if as the population increases the country
becomes more developed, the increase in population will be good for the economy.Â  In the
more developed countries, the decrease in population will be bad for the economy because
there will be less people to spend money.Â  The social implications of the changing of
proportions of the worldâ€™s people will not really change because the changing of
proportions is small.Â  It is not as if more developed countries will have a higher
percentage of people than less developed countries; the proportion will basically remain
the same.

4. Â Â Â  Examine the crude birth rate, crude death rate, and rate of natural increase
of any three countries (one being your own country) listed on theÂ  World Population Data
Sheet . Country Crude birth rate (%) Crude death rate (%) Rate of natural increase (%) U.S. Â 
1.4 0.8 1.2 Albania Â  1.0 0.5 0.5 Egypt Â  2.7 0.6 2.1

    The mathematical relationship is that the rate of natural increase is the difference
    between birth rates and death rates.Â  The conclusion of the three countries we chose,
    which are the U.S., Albania, and Egypt have an annual increase in population.

    1 - Age-dependency ratio: Select 2 LDCs and 2 MDCs from the data sheet and compute the
    age-dependency ratios for each.

    

Country Age-dependency ratio LCD - Sudan Â  Â  78% LCD - Ethiopia Â  88% MDC - Canada Â 
44% MCD- Germany Â  51%

-What factors do you think contribute to a high age-dependency ratio? Â 

The factors that contribute to a high age dependency ratio are more people being economically
productive within the age group of 15 to 65 years.Â  The less developed countries seem to
have a higher age dependency ratio meaning that there is a larger percentage of people ranging
from ages 15 to 65 that are economically productive, especially compared to more developed
countries.Â  This makes sense because to keep a stable economy, less developed countries
require more people to be working and be economically productive.Â 

-What are some economic and social consequences of a high age-dependency ratio?

An economic consequence of having a high age dependency ratio is that the economy has a better
chance of growing because more people, especially in the age group of 15 to 65, are part of the
work force.Â  A social consequence is that more people simply have to work, so there is less
free time and it is socially unfortunate.

-What Is an Age-Sex Graph? Â 

AnÂ  age-sex graph , commonly referred to as a Â population pyramid Â even though the
graph for some countries is not actually a pyramid shape, displays a populationâ€™s age
and sex composition .

-From the following table select one country from each column (two countries) from for your
case. Column A Column B United Kingdom Bangladesh France Macedonia, FYROM Germany Egypt
Israel Ethiopia Japan * Albania Â  New Zealand Thailand Russia Turkey * Greece Vietnam

Table1. Two groups of countries classified based on several economic factors

-Â  Me and Adam choose Greece and Albania.

Ecological Footprints &Â Diet

Posted: October 23, 2010 in Assignment 5

0

Although a small percentage of humans worldwide spend a lot of time in order to find the
healthiest way to live, there are some of them that by not even carrying about themselves
damage the environment. Through this post I will show how total ecological equivalent
calories are compared between the plant consumers and the animal consumers.

The ecological footprint compares human demand with planet Earth’s environmental
capacity to redevelop. In terms of energy or nutrients flow through environment, organisms
can be classified as producers and consumers .Â  Plants can be the best example of
producers. As discussed in class what they do is, convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar
by using the energy from sunlight. This process is well known as photosynthesis. (Energy and
Nutrients flow through Ecosystems,2003)

Pic.1 Diet Source of calories Number of calories Ecologically equivalent calories Total
ecologically equivalent calories 100% plant 0% animal Plant 2,000 2,000 2,000 Animal 0 0 90%
plant 10% animal Plant 1,800 1,800 3,800 Animal 200 2,000 50% plant 50% animal Plant 1,000
1,000 3,000 Animal 1,000 2,000 0% plant 100% animal Plant 0 0 20,000 Animal 2,000 20,000

Â  Vegetarians vs Animal Consumers

Diet 1 - Vegetarians have lower number of calories. (2,000 x 365= 730,000)

Diet 2 - With 10% additional animal product the number of calories increases by 1800 calories
compared to those of the vegetarians. (3,800 x 365= 1,387,000)

Diet 3 - Consumers of animal products vs plant products. (3000 x 365= 1,095,000)

Diet 4 - The consumers of animal products get higher number of calories (20,000 x 365=
7,300,000)Â Â 

Â  Our Diet

Â Kostjan & Anna- (70% animal, 30% plant) â€“ (1400 x 10 + 600= 14,600)

Approximately we consume 70% animal products & 30% plant products. Based on the above
calculations our total ecological equivalent to the calories per day is 14,600, which I think
is way higher than the EEC of a vegetarian.Â 

Â  American style diet

Â  In our days human growing population is becoming a really hot issue. One of the aspects for
sure is the food supply. If we think of American way of living or their style diet which is rich of
animal fat and proteins than we have to consume a lot of animal products. The best way to choose
is to try and balance our diet by equaling the amount of animal and plant products. On the other
hand, if we only go for animals than we wont know for how long animals will be our first choice as a
product.Â Â

Extraordinary Animals..ExtremeÂ Conditions

Posted: October 17, 2010 in Assignment 4

0

Welcome to the world ofÂ Tardigrades-

Although most living things live in stable conditions, there are many animals who live in
extreme temperatures and learn to adapt to there outrageous environments, through this post
I will explain in great detail how the Tardigrade species manages to survive in temperatures
minus 200 degrees celsius as well as 151 degrees celsius.

As Molles (2010) opens up his Chapter 5 about Temperature relations, (p. 100) states how
temperature is one of the most ecologically significant environmental factors.
Tardigrades first were classified as nematodes but now they are classified
asÂ Tardigrada. Â The speciesÂ  Echiniscoides sigimunde from European and Asian
coastal habitats is the largest known to science.Â Tardigrades are able to Â withstand
hostile conditions for example, some can survive in temperatures as low as minus 200 degrees
Celsius while others can survive temperatures as high as 151 degrees. Â Tardigrades are
able to survive the process of freezing and changes in salinity. Surprisingly they can also
survive with no oxygen or a lack of oxygen. â€œTardigrades also are resistant to levels of
X-ray radiation that are hundreds of times more lethal to humans and other
organisms.â€� The tardigrade is part of the heterotardigrade class. Scientists
believe that tardigrades appeared probably 540 million years ago during the Cambrian
explosion. Â â€�Tardigrades are thought to be the most closely related to
onychophorans, caterpillar-like invertebrates that share traits with both arthropods and
worms. The tardigrade biomes are located mainly in Europe however traces have been found in
South America, Australia, Asia and Africa. Species have also been found in the poles.



Image: http://act20070161.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/eco-1.gif?w=614

Scientists have discovered thatÂ Â tardigrades most likely originally evolved in the
ocean, and only later moved to fresh water and terrestrial habitats. The first group of
tardigrades, the heterotardigrada is marine while the other group, the Eutardigrada is only
terrestrial. Tardigrades need to thermoregulate in order to achieve homeostasis. When
hydrated, tardigrades contain about 85 % of their weight in water. Shockingly, they can
survive even when they dehydrate to less than 2% and survive in their inactive state. As
explained by K. Schmidt- Nielsen (1983) when discussing how animals balance heat gain and
loss, tardigrades have an incredibleÂ ability to regulate their metabolism. While in
extreme conditions, they would change the metabolism speeds to a hundred times slower than
normal metabolism. That change makes it able to survive without water, air, atÂ high
temperatures, and lowÂ temperatures. This process is known as cryptobiosis.

a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Discuss the connotation of the words ecologist
and environmentalist. What could be a difference, if any? Would you like to be labeled either
of these names?

Ecology and environmental science are closely related disciplines, and familiarity with
the principles of one is essential to fully understanding the other.Ecology derives from the
Greek words Î¿ ik Î¿ s which means “house” or “living relations”; and logia ,
“study of”.

Image:
http://arlington-honors-bio.wikispaces.com/file/view/ecology.jpg/69291877/ecology.jpg
From my point of view Ecology is the scientific study of the distributions and/or relations of
different kinds of organisms and their interactions with the environment. From the word
itself ecology also includes the study of different hierarchyâ€™s such as plant and
animal populations, plant and animal communities and ecosystems. On the other hand though
the environmentalist itâ€™s the person that in a way or the other supports any goals or
changes from different environmental movements. Its most probably based on the prospective
technologies and how will this technologies prevent adverse effect on the natural
environment. An important difference between ecology and environmental science can be the
goal of research in each discipline. Unlike environmental scientists, ecologists tend to
focus their research on very specific populations of living things, such as a certain type of
grass or a group of fishes. Ecologists seek to understand how populations interact,
reproduce, and thrive within an ecosystem. They concentrate mainly on immediate factors
such as food preferences, predation, and sexual selection within a group. Through careful
observation and historical research, ecologists explain the developmental and
evolutionary adaptations that influence a species. Environmental scientists conduct
laboratory and field studies to learn about a range of factors that influence an area. Like
ecologists, they study living things and their behaviors in detail. In addition,
environmental scientists consider the impacts of climate, geological processes ,
temperature changes, and water cycles when investigating ecosystems . But at the end I think
that both sciences provide very important information about nature and what people can do to
better protect the planet and conserve resources. Thinking about it would be really good for
me to be called by one of these names. Thatâ€™s important for the environment because
knowing everything about it you can try and help it to not get worst.

About meâ€Š..

Hey, hello everyone, my name is Kostjan Ndrio and im a student in ACT , my major is Managment and
in my senior year. Im from Albania , and was born in a city which is called Korca 245 km from
Thessaloniki. I spent a portion of my teenage in Tirana , which is the city that iÂ  spend most
of the time when im go back in my country. I choose Ecology because its a mandatory class in ACT
but also because im interesting to learn more about the environment. From now on in this blog
you will allÂ learn more about me an also the interesting discussions that we will have
about ecology class.

About Albaniaâ€Š.

Albania has a total area of 28,748Â km2 (11,100 sqÂ mi). It shares a 172Â km (107 mi)
border with Montenegro to the n

Image:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Coastline_in_Albania.jpg
orthwest, a 115Â km (71 mi) border with Kosovo [a] to the northeast, a 151Â km (94 mi)
border with Skopje to the north and east, and a 282Â km (175 mi) border with Greece to the
south and southeast. Its coastline is 487Â km (303 mi) long. The lowlands of the west face
the Adriatic Sea and the strategically important Strait of Otranto , which puts less than
100Â km (62 mi) of water between Albania and the heel of the Italian “boot” (links
Adriatic Sea to Ionian Sea and Mediterranean Sea ).Albania has coastline on the Adriatic Sea
and the Ionian Sea . The 70% of the country that is mountainous is rugged and often
inaccessible. The remainder, an alluvial plain, receives precipitation seasonally, is
poorly drained, and is alternately arid or flooded. Far from offering a relief from the
difficult interior terrain, the alluvial plain is often as inhospitable as the mountains.
Good soil and dependable precipitation, however, are found in intermountain river basins,
in the lake district along the eastern frontier, and in a narrow band of slightly elevated land
between the coastal plains and the interior mountains. In the far north, the mountains are an
extension of the Dinaric Alps and, more specifically, the Montenegrin limestone plateau .
Albania’s northern mountains are more folded and rugged, however, than most of the
plateau. The rivers have deep valleys with steep sides and arable valley floors. Generally
unnavigable, the rivers obstruct rather than encourage movement within the alpine region.
Roads are few and poor. Lacking internal communications and external contacts, a tribal
society flourished in this area for centuries. Only after World War II were serious efforts
made to incorporate the people of the region into Albanian national life. A low coastal belt
extends from the northern boundary southward to the vicinity of VlorÃ« . On average, it
extends less than sixteen kilometers inland, but widens to about 50Â km (31 mi) in the
Elbasan area in central Albania. In its natural state, the coastal belt is characterized by
low scrub vegetation, varying from barren to dense. There are large areas of marshlands and
other areas of bare, eroded badlands. Where elevations rise slightly and precipitation is
regular–in the foothills of the central uplands, for example–the land is highly arable.
Marginal land is reclaimed wherever irrigation is possible.Just east of the lowlands, the
central uplands, called Ã‡ermenikÃ« by Albanians, are an area of generally moderate
elevations, between 305 and 915 m (1,001 and 3,002 ft), with a few points reaching above
1,520Â m (4,987 ft). Shifting along the fault that roughly defines the western edge of the
central uplands causes frequent, and occasionally severe, earthquakes. The mountains east
of the serpentine zone are the highest in Albania, exceeding 2,754Â m (9,035 ft) in the
Mount Korab ( Mali Korabit ) range at Korabi’s Peak ( Maja e Korabit ). Together with the
Prokletije and the serpentine zone, the eastern highlands are the most rugged and
inaccessible of any terrain on the Balkan Peninsula. The mountains east of the serpentine
zone are the highest in Albania, exceeding 2,754Â m (9,035 ft) in the Mount Korab ( Mali

the eastern highlands are the most rugged and inaccessible of any terrain on the Balkan
Peninsula. The three lakes of easternmost Albania, Lake Ohrid ( Liqeni Ohrit ), Big Prespa
Lake ( Prespa e Madhe ), and Small Prespa Lake ( Prespa e VogÃ«l ), are remote and picturesque.
Much of the terrain

their vicinity is not overly steep, and it supports a larger population than any other inland
portion of the country. Albania’s eastern border passes through Lake Ohrid; all but a small
tip of Prespa e VogÃ«l is in Greece; and the point at which the boundaries of three states meet
is in Lake Prespa. Each of the two larger lakes has a total surface areas of about 260 square
kilometers, and Prespa e VogÃ«l is about one-fifth as large. The surface elevation is about
695Â m (2,280 ft) for Lake Ohrid and 855Â m (2,805 ft) for the other two lakes. The Drin
River is the largest and most constant stream. Fed by melting snows from the northern and
eastern mountains and by the more evenly distributed seasonal precipitation of that area,
its flow does not have the extreme variations characteristic of nearly all other rivers in the
country. Its normal flow varies seasonally by only about one-third. Along its length of about
282Â km (175 mi), it drains nearly 5,957Â km 2 (2,300 sqÂ mi) within Albania.

For me the most significant environmental issue is Ocean Acidification , The word
“startling” above is not hype.Â  Ocean acidification seems to be the best kept secret
in environmental science despite that it may, in a matter of a few decades, devastate our
oceans. For more info watch this video.
