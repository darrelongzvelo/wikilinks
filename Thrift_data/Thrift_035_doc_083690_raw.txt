World War II , or the Second World War (often abbreviated as WWII or WW2 ), was a global Military
conflict lasting from 1939 to 1945, which involved most of the world's nations, including all
of the great powers: eventually forming two opposing military alliances, the Allies and the
Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, with more than 100 million military personnel
mobilised. In a state of "total war," the major participants placed their entire economic,
industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the
distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by significant events
involving the mass death of civilians, including the Holocaust and the only use of nuclear
weapoms in warfare, it was the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in 50 million to
over 70 million fatalities.

The war is generally accepted to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by
Germany and Slovakia, and subsequent declaration of war on Germany by France and most of the
countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth. Germany set out to establish a large empire
in Europe. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany
conquered or subdued much of continental Europe; amid Nazi-Soviet agreements, the
nominally neutral Soviet Union fully or partially occupied and annexed territories of its
six European neighbours. Britain and the Commonwealth remained the only major force
continuing the fight against the Axis in North Africa and in extensive naval warfare. In June
1941, the European Axis launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, giving a start to the largest
land theatre of war history, which, from this moment on, was tying down the major part of the
Axis military power. In December 1941, Japan, which had been at war with China since 1937, and
aimed to dominate Asia, attacked the United States and European possessions in the Pacific
Ocean, quickly conquering much of the region.

The Axis advance was stopped in 1942 after the defeat of Japan in a series of naval battles and
after defeats of European Axis troops in North Africa and, decisively, at Stalingrad. In
1943, with a series of German Defeats in Eastern Europe, the Allied Invasion of Facist Italy,
and American victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic
retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded France, while the Soviet Union
regained all territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies.

The war in Europe ended with the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the
subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. The Japanese Navy was defeated by
the United States, and invasion of the Japanese Archipelago ("Home Islands") became
imminent. The war in Asia ended on 15 August 1945 with the surrender of Japan.

The war ended with the total victory of the Allies over Germany and Japan in 1945. World War II
altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The United Nations (UN)
was established to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts. The
Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the
Cold War, which would last for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great
powers started to decline, while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began. Most countries
whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery. Political integration,
especially in Europe emerged as an effort to stabilise postwar relations.

Invasion of Poland

Edit



The Invasion of Poland , also known as the September Campaign or 1939 Defensive War ( Polish :
Kampania wrzeÅ›niowa or Wojna obronna 1939 roku ) in Poland and the Poland Campaign (
German : Polenfeldzug ) in Germany, was an invasion of Poland by Germany , the Soviet Union , and
a small Slovak contingent that marked the start of World War II in Europe . The invasion began on
1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact , and
ended on 6 October 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of
Poland .

The morning after the Gleiwitz incident , German forces invaded Poland from the north, south,
and west. As the Germans advanced, Polish forces withdrew from their forward bases of
operation close to the Polish-German border to more established lines of defence to the east.
After the mid-September Polish defeat in the Battle of the Bzura , the Germans gained an
undisputed advantage. Polish forces then withdrew to the southeast where they prepared for a
long defence of the Romanian Bridgehead and awaited expected support and relief from France
and the United Kingdom . The two countries had pacts with Poland and had declared war on Germany
on 3 September, though in the end their aid to Poland in the September campaign was very
limited.

The Soviet Red Army 's invasion of Eastern Poland on 17 September, in accordance with a secret
protocol of the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact, rendered the Polish plan of defence
obsolete. Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded the defence of the Romanian
Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all troops to
neutral Romania . On 6 October, following the Polish defeat at the Battle of Kock , German and
Soviet forces gained full control over Poland. The success of the invasion marked the end of
the Second Polish Republic , though Poland never formally surrendered.

On 8 October, after an initial period of military administration , Germany directly annexed
western Poland and the former Free City of Danzig and placed the remaining block of territory
under the administration of the newly established General Government . The Soviet Union
incorporated its newly acquired areas into its constituent Belarusian and Ukrainian
republics , and immediately started a campaign of sovietization . This included staged
elections, the results of which were used to legitimize the Soviet Union's annexation of
eastern Poland. In the aftermath of the invasion, a collective of underground resistance
organizations formed the Polish Underground State within the territory of the former Polish
state. Many of the military exiles that managed to escape Poland subsequently joined the
Polish Armed Forces in the West , an armed force loyal to the Polish government in exile .

Prelude to the Campaign



In 1933, the National-Socialist German Workers' Party â€”under its leader Adolf
Hitler â€”came to power in Germany . Germany sought to gain hegemony in Europe, and to
take over territory from the Soviet Union, acquiring "Living Space" ( Lebensraum ) and
expanding "Greater Germany" ( GroÃŸdeutschland ), to be eventually surrounded by a ring of
allied states, satellite or puppet states . As part of this long term policy, at first, Hitler
pursued a policy of rapprochement with Poland, trying to improve Germanâ€“Polish
relations , culminating in the Germanâ€“Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934. Earlier,
Hitler's foreign policy worked to weaken the ties between Poland and France , and to manoeuvre
Poland into the Anti-Comintern Pact , forming a cooperative front against the Soviet Union.
Poland would be granted territory of its own, to its northeast, but the concessions the Poles
were expected to make meant that their homeland would become largely dependent on Germany,
functioning as little more than a client state. The Poles feared that their independence
would eventually be threatened altogether.

In addition to Soviet territory, the National-Socialists were also interested in
establishing a new border with Poland because the German exclave of East Prussia was
separated from the rest of the Reich by the " Polish Corridor ". The Corridor constituted land
long disputed by Poland and Germany, and inhabited by both groups. The Corridor became a part
of Poland after the Treaty of Versailles . Many Germans also wanted the city of Danzig and its
environs (together the Free City of Danzig ) to be reincorporated into Germany. Danzig was an

Vyacheslav Molotov signs the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a Germanâ€“Soviet
non-aggression pact.

Added by Revan S. Smith important port city with 95% of the population German speakers. It had
been separated from Germany after Versailles and made into a nominally independent Free City
of Danzig. Hitler sought to reverse these territorial losses, and on many occasions made an
appeal to German nationalism , promising to "liberate" the German minority still in the
Corridor, as well as Danzig.

Poland participated in the partition of Czechoslovakia that followed the Munich Agreement ,
although they were not part of the agreement. It coerced Czechoslovakia to surrender the
region of ÄŒeskÃœ TÄ›Å¡Ã­n by issuing an ultimatum to that effect on 30 September
1938, which was accepted by Czechoslovakia on 1 October.

By 1937, Germany began to increase its demands for Danzig, while proposing that a roadway be
built in order to connect East Prussia with Germany proper, running through the Polish
Corridor. Poland rejected this proposal, fearing that after accepting these demands, it
would become increasingly subject to the will of Germany and eventually lose its
independence as the Czechs had. Polish leaders also distrusted Hitler. Furthermore,
Germany's collaboration with anti-Polish Ukrainian nationalists from the Organization of
Ukrainian Nationalists , which was seen as an effort to isolate and weaken Poland, weakened
Hitler's credibility from the Polish point of view. The British were also aware of the
situation between Germany and Poland. On 31 March, Poland was backed by a guarantee from
Britain and France which stated that Polish territorial integrity would be defended with
their support. On the other hand, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his Foreign
Secretary , Lord Halifax , still hoped to strike a deal with Hitler regarding Danzig (and
possibly the Polish Corridor), and Hitler hoped for the same. Chamberlain and his supporters
believed war could be avoided and hoped Germany would agree to leave the rest of Poland alone.
German hegemony over Central Europe was also at stake.

With tensions mounting, Germany turned to aggressive diplomacy as well. On 28 April 1939, it
unilaterally

Added by Revan S. Smith withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and
the London Naval Agreement of 1935. Nevertheless, talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke
down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During
this interim, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance
with the Soviet Union against Germany and the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with
Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible "solution
of the Polish problem by military means"â€”a Case White scenario.

However, with the surprise signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August, the
denouement of secret Nazi-Soviet talks held in Moscow , Germany neutralized the possibility
of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and war became imminent. In fact, the
Soviets agreed to aid Germany in the event of France or the UK going to war with Germany over
Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide
Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two spheres of influence; the western â…“ of the
country was to go to Germany and the eastern â…” to the Soviet Union.

The German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25
August, the Polish-British Common Defence Pact was signed as an annex to the Franco-Polish
Military Alliance . In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland,
guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles
were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussionsâ€”not at all how
Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1
September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion "in mid-leap".

However, there was one exception: in the night of 25â€“6 August, a German sabotage group
which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the Jablunkov Pass
and Mosty railway station in Silesia . On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by
Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident "caused by an insane
individual" (see JabÅ‚onkÃ³w Incident ).

On 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the
upcoming conflict, even pledging that the Wehrmacht forces would be made available to
Britain's empire in the future. The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little
chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the
lack of "territorial guarantees" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise
favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the number of increased
overflights by high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and cross border troop movements
signalled that war was imminent.

On 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with Fall
Weiss "Case White" yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a
communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish
Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitlerâ€™s demands) in addition to the
safeguarding of the German minority in Poland. It said that they were willing to commence
negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement
had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals. The
British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how Emil
Hacha had been forced to sign his country away under similar circumstances just months
earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with
full signing powers as an unacceptable ultimatum . On the night of 30/31 August, German
Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop read a 16-point German proposal to the British
ambassador. When the ambassador requested a copy of the proposals for transmission to the
Polish government Ribbentrop refused on the grounds that the requested Polish
representative had failed to arrive by midnight. When Polish Ambassador Lipski went to see
Ribbentrop later on 31 August to indicate that Poland was favorably disposed to
negotiations, he announced that he did not have the full power to sign, and Ribbentrop
dismissed him. It was then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germany's offer, and
negotiations with Poland came to an end. Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence
soon afterwards.

On 29 August, German saboteurs planted a bomb at the railway station in TarnÃ³w and killed 21
passengers, leaving 35 wounded.

On 30 August, the Polish Navy sent its destroyer flotilla to Britain, executing Operation
Peking . On the same day, Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-ÅšmigÅ‚y announced the
mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the
French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the
Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border. During the night of 31
August, the Gleiwitz incident , a false flag attack on the radio station, was staged near the
border city of Gleiwitz by German units posing as Polish troops, in Upper Silesia as part of the
wider Operation Himmler . On 31 August 1939, Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to
start at 4:45 the next morning. Because of the prior stoppage, Poland managed to mobilize only
70% of its planned forces, and many units were still forming or moving to their designated
frontline positions.

Edit



Germany had a substantial numerical advantage over Poland and had developed a significant
military prior to the conflict. The Heer (army) had some 2,400 tanks organized into six panzer
divisions, utilizing a new operational doctrine . It held that these divisions should act in
coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and
isolating selected units, which would be encircled and destroyed. This would be followed up
by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The Luftwaffe (air force) provided
both tactical and strategic air power , particularly dive bombers that disrupted lines of
supply and communications. Together, the so-called "new" methods, were nicknamed "
Blitzkrieg " (lightning war). Historian Basil Liddell Hart claimed "Poland was a full
demonstration of the Blitzkrieg theory." Some other historians , however, disagree.

Aircraft played a major role in the campaign. Bombers also attacked cities, causing huge
losses amongst the civilian population through terror bombing . The Luftwaffe forces
consisted of 1,180 fighters , 290 Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers , 1,100 conventional bombers
(mainly Heinkel He 111s and Dornier Do 17s ), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350
reconnaissance aircraft. In total, Germany had close to 4,000 aircraft, most of them modern.
A force of 2,315 aircraft was assigned to Weiss . Due to its prior participation in the Spanish
Civil War , the Luftwaffe was probably the most experienced, best trained and best equipped
air force in the world in 1939.

Poland

Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the Central Industrial Region .
Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans
assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development,
Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced. In 1936, a

Added by Revan S. Smith National Defence Fund was set up to collect funds necessary for
strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The Polish Army had approximately a million
soldiers, but less than Âœ of them were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained
significant casualties when public transport became targets of the Luftwaffe . The Polish
military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the
infantry, were unable to effectively engage the enemy.

Experiences in the Polish-Soviet War shaped Polish Army organizational and operational
doctrine. Unlike the trench warfare of World War I , the Polish-Soviet War was a conflict in
which the cavalry 's mobility played a decisive role. Poland acknowledged the benefits of
mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since
then. In spite of this, Polish cavalry brigades were used as a mobile mounted infantry and had
some successes against both German infantry and cavalry.

Added by Revan S. Smith The Polish Air Force ( Lotnictwo Wojskowe ) was at a severe disadvantage
against the German Luftwaffe , although it was not destroyed on the ground early on, as is
commonly believed. The Polish Air Force lacked modern fighters, but its pilots were among the
world's best trained, as proven a year later in the Battle of Britain , in which the Poles played
a major part.

Overall, the Germans enjoyed numerical and qualitative aircraft superiority. Poland had
only about 600 aircraft, of which only 37 P-37 Å�oÅ› bombers were modern and comparable
to its German counterparts. The Polish Air Force had roughly 185 PZL P.11 and some 95 PZL P.7
fighters, 175 PZL.23 KaraÅ› Bs, 35 KaraÅ› As, and by September, over 100 PZL.37s were
produced. However, for the September Campaign, only some 70% of those aircraft were
mobilized. Only 36 PZL.37s were deployed. All those aircraft were of indigenous Polish
design, with the bombers being more modern than fighters, according to the LudomiÅ‚
Rayski air force expansion plan, which relied on a strong bomber force. The Polish fighters
were a generation older than their German counterparts; the PZL P.11
fighterâ€”produced in the early 1930sâ€”had a top speed of only 365 km/h (227
mph), far less than German bombers. To compensate, the pilots relied on its maneuverability
and high diving speed.

The tank force consisted of two armored brigades, four independent tank battalions and some
30 companies of TKS tankettes attached to infantry divisions and cavalry brigades. A
standard tank of the Polish Army during the Polish Defensive War of 1939 was the 7TP light tank .
It was the first tank in the world to be equipped with a diesel engine and 360Â° Gundlach
periscope . The 7TP was significantly better armed than its most common opponents, the German
Panzer I and II , but only 140 tanks were produced between 1935 and the outbreak of the war.
Poland had also a few relatively modern imported designs, such as 50 Renault R35 tanks and 38
Vickers E tanks.

The Polish Navy was a small fleet of destroyers , submarines and smaller support vessels. Most
Polish surface units followed Operation Peking , leaving Polish ports on 20 August and
escaping by way of the North Sea to join with the British Royal Navy . Submarine forces
participated in Operation Worek , with the goal of engaging and damaging German shipping in
the Baltic Sea , but they had much less success. In addition, many merchant marine ships joined
the British merchant fleet and took part in wartime convoys .

Phoney War / Battle from September 1939-May 1940



The Phoney War was a phase early in World War II â€”in the months following Britain and
France's declaration of war on Germany (shortly after the German invasion of Poland ) in
September 1939 and preceding the Battle of France in May 1940â€”that was marked by a lack
of major military operations in Continental Europe . The various European powers had
declared war on one another but neither side had committed to launching a significant land
offensive, notwithstanding the terms of the Anglo-Polish military alliance and the
Franco-Polish military alliance , which obliged the United Kingdom and France to assist
Poland.

The period was also called at the time, the Twilight War by Winston Churchill , der Sitzkrieg in
German ("the sitting war": a play on the word Blitzkrieg ), the Bore War (a play on the Boer War ),
the Polish dziwna wojna ("strange war"), and the French drÃŽle de guerre ("strange/funny
war"). The American news magazine TIME called the period the Lullablitz .

The term Phoney War was possibly coined by U.S. Senator William Borah who stated in September
1939, "There is something phoney about this war."

Inactivity



While most of the German army was engaged in Poland , a much smaller German force manned the
Siegfried Line , their fortified defensive line along the French border. At the Maginot Line
on the other side of the border, British and French troops stood facing them, but there were
only some local, minor skirmishes . The Royal Air Force dropped propaganda leaflets on
Germany and the first Canadian troops stepped ashore in Britain, while

Added by Revan S. Smith western Europe was in a strange calm for seven months. Meanwhile, the
opposing nations clashed in the Norwegian Campaign . In their hurry to re-arm, Britain and
France had both begun buying large amounts of weapons from manufacturers in the U.S. at the
outbreak of hostilities, supplementing their own productions. The non-belligerent U.S.
contributed to the Western Allies by discounted sales, and, later, lend-lease of military
equipment and supplies.

Despite the relative calm on land, on the high seas the war was very real indeed. Within a few
hours of the declaration of war, the British liner Athenia was torpedoed off the Hebrides with
the loss of 112 lives in what was to be the beginning of the long running Battle of the Atlantic .
On 4 September, the Allies announced a blockade of Germany to prevent her importing food and
raw materials to sustain her war effort, and the Germans immediately declared a
counter-blockade.

At the Nuremberg Trials , Alfred Jodl said that "if we did not collapse already in the year 1939
that was due only to the fact that during the Polish campaign, the approximately 110 French and
British divisions in the West were held completely inactive against the 23 German
divisions."

Saar Offensive



The Saar Offensive was a French operation into Saarland on the German 1st Army defence sector
in the early stages of World War II . The purpose of the attack was to assist Poland , which was
then under attack . However, the assault was stopped and the French forces withdrew.

According to the Franco-Polish military convention , the French Army was to start
preparations for the major offensive three days after mobilisation started. The French
forces were to effectively gain control over the area between the French border and the German
lines and were to probe the German defenses. On the 15th day of the mobilization (that is on 16
September), the French Army was to start a full-scale assault on Germany. The preemptive
mobilization was started in France on August 26 and on September 1 full mobilization was
declared.

French mobilization suffered from an inherently out of date system. The French
militaryâ€²s ordnance lacked the tanks and planes of the mechanized German military
which greatly affected their ability to swiftly deploy their forces on the field, French
command still believed in tactics of the previous war which relied heavily on stationary
artillery which took time to transport and deploy (many pieces also had to be retrieved from
storage before any advance could be made).

A French offensive in the Rhine valley began on 7 September, four days after France declared
war on Germany. Then, the Wehrmacht was occupied in the attack on Poland, and the French
soldiers enjoyed a decisive numerical advantage along the border with Germany. However, the
French did not take any action that was able to assist the Poles. Eleven French divisions
advanced along a 32 km (20 mi) line near SaarbrÃŒcken against weak German opposition. The
French army had advanced to a depth of 8 km (5.0 mi) and captured about 20 villages evacuated by
the German army, without any resistance. However, the half-hearted offensive was halted
after France seized the Warndt Forest, 3 sq mi (7.8 km 2 ) of heavily- mined German territory.

The attack did not result in any diversion of German troops. The all-out assault was to be
carried out by roughly 40 divisions, including one armored division, three mechanized
divisions, 78 artillery regiments and 40 tank battalions. On 12 September, the Anglo French
Supreme War Council gathered for the first time at Abbeville in France. It was decided that all
offensive actions were to be halted immediately. General Maurice Gamelin ordered his troops
to stop "not closer than 1 kilometre" from the German positions along the Siegfried Line .
Poland was not notified of this decision. Instead, Gamelin informed Marshal Edward
Rydz-ÅšmigÅ‚y that 1/2 of his divisions were in contact with the enemy, and that French
advances had forced the Wehrmacht to withdraw at least six divisions from Poland. The
following day, the commander of the French Military Mission to Poland â€”General Louis
Faury â€”informed the Polish chief of staffâ€”General WacÅ‚aw Stachiewicz
â€”that the planned major offensive on the western front had to be postponed from 17
September to 20 September. At the same time, French divisions were ordered to retreat to their
barracks along the Maginot Line . The Phoney War had begun.

Winter War



The Winter War ( Finnish : Talvisota , Swedish : Vinterkriget , Russian :
Ð—ÐžÐŒÐœÑ�Ñ� Ð²ÐŸÐ¹ÐœÐ° ( trans. Zimnyaya voyna ) was a
military conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland . It began with a Soviet offensive on 30
November 1939 â€“ three months after the start of World War II and the Soviet invasion of
Poland â€“ and ended on 13 March 1940 with the Moscow Peace Treaty . The League of Nations
deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet

Added by Revan S. Smith Union from the League on 14 December 1939.

The Soviet forces had three times as many soldiers as the Finns, 30 times as many aircraft, and a
hundred times as many tanks . The Red Army , however, had been crippled by Soviet leader Joseph
Stalin 's Great Purge of 1937, reducing the army's morale and efficiency shortly before the
outbreak of the fighting. With more than 30,000 of its army officers executed or imprisoned,
including most of those of the highest ranks, the Red Army in 1939 had many inexperienced
senior officers. Because of these factors, and high commitment and morale in the Finnish
forces, Finland was able to resist the Soviet invasion for far longer than the Soviets
expected.

Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty. Finland ceded
11% of its pre-war territory and 30% of its economic assets to the Soviet Union. Soviet losses
on the front were heavy, and the country's international reputation suffered. The Soviet
forces did not accomplish their objective of the total conquest of Finland, but did gain
sufficient territory along Lake Ladoga to provide a buffer for Leningrad . The Finns,
however, retained their sovereignty and enhanced their international reputation.

The peace treaty thwarted the Franco-British plan to send troops to Finland through northern
Scandinavia. One of the Allied operation's major goals had been to take control of northern
Sweden's iron ore and cut its deliveries to Germany .

Battle of TolvajÃ€rvi



Prelude: After the Winter War broke out on November 30, the Finnish troops north of Lake Ladoga
began a pre-planned retreat before the overwhelming opposition. It was not thought possible
for the Soviets to deploy large number of troops in this rugged and almost roadless area, but
the Soviets deployed an entire division which advanced along the road between SuojÃ€rvi
and TolvajÃ€rvi (now Tolvayarvi, Russia). The Soviet advance was a serious threat to the
Finnish IV Corps' lines of communication. To counter this threat the Finnish high command
assembled "Group Talvela" commanded by Colonel Paavo Talvela .

Battle: The northern group consisting of two battalions soon met Soviet resistance. In fact,
they met the Soviet 718th regiment which was preparing to make its own attack on the Finnish
flank. By noon, the Finnish troops withdrew to their own lines. Although this attack was a
failure, it prevented the 718th from attacking the Finnish flank, and also from sending
reinforcements to the south.

While the second battalion of the Finnish 16th infantry regiment (II/JR 16) was preparing to
attack along the road it was interrupted by an attack from the Soviet 609th regiment. The Finns
were still able to attack after they got some artillery support. The Finnish attack continued
towards a hotel located on a thin isthmus between the two lakes. Pajari decided to commit his
reserves in a pincer attack at the Soviet troops around the hotel. In the end the hotel was
captured and in it were found a dead Soviet regimental commander and all the regiment's
papers.

The Finns withdrew back over the lakes for the night. In the morning Colonel Talvela demanded a
new attack and the 139th division was pushed back and later (20â€“22 December)
destroyed around Ã„glÃ€jÃ€rvi (now, Yaglyayarvi) (some 20 km from
TolvajÃ€rvi). Contact was also made with the 75th Soviet division which was sent as
reinforcements.

Battle of Suomussalmi

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



{C}On November 30, 1939, the Soviet 163rd division crossed the border between Finland and the
Soviet Union and advanced from the north-east towards the village of Suomussalmi . The Soviet
objective was to advance to the city of Oulu , effectively cutting Finland in half. This sector
had only one Finnish battalion (Er.P 15), which was placed near Raate , outside Suomussalmi.

Suomussalmi was taken with little resistance on December 7 (only two incomplete companies of
covering forces led a holding action between the border and Suomussalmi), but the Finns
destroyed the village before this, to deny the Soviets shelter, and withdrew to the opposite
shore of lakes NiskanselkÃ€ and HaukiperÃ€.

The first extensive fight started on December 8, when Soviet forces began to attack across the
frozen lakes to the west. Their attempt failed completely. The second part of Soviet forces
led the attack to the northwest on Puolanka, that was defended by the Er.P 16 (lit. 16th
detached battalion), that had just arrived. This attempt also failed.

On December 9, the defenders were reinforced with a newly founded regiment (JR 27). Colonel
Hjalmar Siilasvuo was given the command of the Finnish forces and he began immediate
counter-measures to regain Suomussalmi. The main forces advanced on Suomussalmi, but
failed to take the village, suffering serious losses.

On December 24, Soviet units counterattacked, but failed to break through the surrounding
Finnish forces.

Reinforced with two new regiments (JR 64 and JR 65), the Finns again attacked on December 27.
This time, they took the village, and the Soviets retreated in panic over the surrounding
frozen lakes.

During this time, the Soviet 44th Division (mostly composed of Ukrainians) had advanced from
the east towards Suomussalmi. It was entrenched on the road between Suomussalmi and Raate and
got caught up in the retreat of the other Soviet forces.

Between January 4 and January 8, 1940, the 44th Division was divided into isolated groups and
destroyed by the Finnish troops (in a tactic known as motti ), leaving much heavy equipment for
the Finnish troops.

Battle of Changsha



The Japanese launched the attacks on September 17, when their forces in northern Jiangxi
attacked westward toward Hunan. However, the Japanese stretched too far out westward and
were counter-attacked by Chinese forces from the south and the north, forcing them to retreat
eastward.

On September 19, the Japanese then proceeded to attack the Chinese along the Sinchiang River .
Even though the use of poison gas was prohibited by the Geneva Protocol , the Japanese army
employed it on Chinese positions. On September 23 the Japanese drove the Chinese out of the
Sinchiang river area, and the 6th and 13th Divisions crossed the river under artillery cover
and advanced further south along the Miluo River .

Heavy fighting continued after the 23rd and the Chinese retreated southward to attract the
Japanese while supporting battalions arrived on the east and the west for encirclement
maneuver. On September 29 the Japanese reached the outskirts of Changsha. However, they were
unable to conquer the city because their supply lines were cut off by the Chinese. By October 6
the Japanese forces at Changsha were decimated while the remnants retreated northward.

Battle of the River Plate

Edit



On 13 December, the ships sighted each other and closed. Admiral Graf Spee â€”despite
having correctly identified Exeter â€”initially suspected that the two light
cruisers were smaller destroyers and that the British ships were protecting a merchant
convoy, the destruction of which would be a major prize. Since Graf Spee â€²s
reconnaissance aircraft was out of service, Langsdorf relied on lookouts for this
information. He decided to engage, despite having received a broadly accurate report from
the German naval staff on 4 December outlining British activity in the River Plate area. This
report included information that Ajax , Achilles , Exeter and Cumberland were patrolling the
South American coast. Langsdorf realised too late that he was facing three cruisers. Calling
upon the immediate acceleration of his diesel engines, he closed the enemy squadron at 24 kn
(28 mph; 44 km/h) in the hope of engaging the steam-driven British ships before they could work
up from cruising speed to full power.This strategy may seem an inexplicable blunder.
Langsdorf could perhaps have manoeuvered to keep the British ships at a range where he could
destroy them with his 11 in (280 mm) guns while remaining out of the effective range of their
smaller 6- and 8-inch guns. On the other hand, he knew the British cruisers had a 4â€“6 kn
(4.6â€“6.9 mph; 7.4â€“11 km/h) speed advantage over Graf Spee and could in
principle stay out of range should they choose to do soâ€”standard cruiser tactics in
the presence of a superior forceâ€”while calling on reinforcements.

The British executed their battle plan: Exeter turned north-west, while Ajax and Achilles
â€”operating togetherâ€”turned north-east to spread Graf Spee â€²s fire.
Graf Spee opened fire on Exeter at 19,000 yd (17,000 m) with her six 11 in (280 mm) guns at 06:18.
Exeter opened fire at 06:20, Achilles at 06:21, Exeter â€²s aft guns at 06:22 and Ajax at
06:23. From her opening salvo, Graf Spee â€²s gunfire proved fairly accurate, her third
salvo straddling Exeter . At 06:23, an 11 in (280 mm) shell burst just short of Exeter , abreast
the middle of the ship. Splinters from this shell killed the torpedo tubes' crews, damaged the
ship's communications, riddled the ship's funnels and searchlights and wrecked the ship's
Walrus aircraft just as it was to be launched for gunnery spotting. Three minutes later,
Exeter suffered a direct hit in her "B"-turret, putting it and its two guns out of action. [7 ]
Shrapnel swept the bridge, killing or wounding all bridge personnel except the captain and
two others. Captain Bell's communications were wrecked. Communications from the aft
conning position were also destroyed, and the ship had to be steered via a chain of messengers
for the rest of the battle.

Meanwhile, Ajax and Achilles closed to 13,000 yd (12,000 m) and started making in front of Graf
Spee , causing her to split her main armament at 06:30, and otherwise use her 5.9 in (150 mm) guns
against them. At 06:32, Exeter fired two torpedoes from her starboard tubes but both missed.
At 06:37, Ajax launched her spotter aircraft from its catapult . At 06:38, Exeter turned so
that she could fire her port torpedoes, and received two more direct hits from 11 in (280 mm)
shells. One hit "A"-turret and put it out of action, the other entered the hull and started
fires. At this point Exeter was severely damaged, having only "Y"-turret still in action, a
7Â° list , was being flooded and being steered with the use of her small boat's compass . In
return, one of Exeter â€²s 8 in (200 mm) shells penetrated two decks, then exploded in Graf
Spee â€²s funnel area â€” destroying her raw fuel processing system and leaving her
with just 16 hours fuel, insufficient to allow her to return home.

Thus, from 06:38, Graf Spee was doomed; she could not make the fuel system repairs (of this
complexity) under fire. Two-thirds of her anti-aircraft guns were knocked out as well as one
of her secondary turrets. There were no friendly naval bases within reach. She was not
seaworthy and could only make the neutral port of Montevideo.

At approximately 06:36, Admiral Graf Spee hauled around from an easterly course, now behind
Ajax and Achilles , toward the northwest and laid smoke. This position brought Langsdorf
roughly parallel to Exeter . By 06:50, Exeter listed heavily to starboard, taking water
forward. Nevertheless, she still steamed at full speed and fired with her one remaining
turret. Forty minutes later, water splashed in by an 11 in (280 mm) near-miss short-circuited
Exeter â€²s electrical system for that turret. Captain Bell was forced to break off
action. This would have been the opportunity to finish off Exeter . Instead, the combined fire
of Ajax and Achilles drew Langsdorf's attention as both ships closed.

At 06:56, Ajax and Achilles turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear, at 07:10
causing Admiral Graf Spee to turn away and lay a smokescreen. At 07:10, the two light cruisers
turned to reduce the range from 8 mi (7.0 nmi ; 13 km ), even though this meant only their forward
guns could fire. At 07:16, Graf Spee turned to port and headed straight for the heavily damaged
Exeter , but fire from Ajax and Achilles forced her at 07:20 to turn and fire her 11 in (280 mm)
guns at them, who turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear. Ajax turned to starboard
at 07:24 and fired her torpedoes at a range of 4.5 mi (3.9 nmi; 7.2 km), causing Graf Spee to turn
away under a smokescreen. At 07:25, Ajax was hit by an 11 in (280 mm) shell that put "X"-turret
out of action and jammed "Y"-turret, causing some casualties. By 07:40, Ajax and Achilles
were running low on resources and the British decided to change tactics, moving to the east
under a smokescreen. Harwood decided to shadow Admiral Graf Spee and try to attack at night
when he could attack with torpedoes and better utilise his advantage of speed and
manoeuvrability while minimising his deficiencies in armour. Ajax was again hit by an 11 in
(280 mm) shell that destroyed her mast and caused some casualties. Graf Spee continued on a
south-westward course.

The Pursuit

Edit



The battle now turned into a pursuit. Captain Parry of Achilles wrote afterwards: 'To this day
I do not know why the Admiral Graf Spee did not dispose of us in the Ajax and the Achilles as soon as
she had finished with the Exeter . The British and New Zealander cruisers split up keeping
about 15 mi (13 nmi; 24 km) from Graf Spee . Ajax kept to the German's port and the Achilles to the
starboard. At 09:15, Ajax recovered her aircraft. At 09:46, Harwood signalled to the
Cumberland for reinforcement, and the Admiralty also ordered ships within 3,000 mi (2,600
nmi; 4,800 km) to proceed to the River Plate. At 10:05, Achilles had overestimated Graf Spee
â€²s speed, and she came into range of the German guns. Graf Spee turned and fired two
three-gun salvoes with her foreguns. Achilles turned away under a smokescreen.

According to Pope, at 11:03 a merchant ship was sighted close to Graf Spee . After a few minutes,
Graf Spee called Ajax on W/T using both ships' pre-war call-signs, with the signal: "please
pick up lifeboats of English steamer". The German call-sign was DTGS, confirming to Harwood
that the pocket-battleship he had engaged was indeed Graf Spee . Ajax did not reply but a little
later the British flagship closed with SS Shakespeare with its lifeboats still hoisted and
men still on board. Graf Spee had fired a gun and ordered them to stop, but when they did not obey
orders to leave the ship Langsdorff decided to continue on his way, and Shakespeare had a lucky
escape. The shadowing continued for the rest of the day until 19:15, when Graf Spee turned and
opened fire on Ajax , which turned away under a smokescreen.

It was now clear that Graf Spee was entering the River Plate Estuary . Since the estuary had
sandbanks , Harwood ordered the Achilles to shadow the Graf Spee while Ajax would cover any
attempt to double back through a different channel. The sun set at 20:48, with Graf Spee
silhouetted against the sun. Achilles had again closed the range and Graf Spee opened fire,
forcing Achilles to turn away. During the battle, a total of 108 men had been killed on both
sides, including 36 on Graf Spee .

Graf Spee entered Montevideo in neutral Uruguay, dropping anchor at about 00:10 on 14
December. This was a political error, since Uruguay, while neutral, had benefited from
significant British influence during its development, and it favoured the Allies. The
British Hospital, for example (where the wounded from the battle were taken) was the leading
hospital in the city. The port of Mar del Plata on the Argentine coast and 200 mi (170 nmi; 320 km)
south of Montevideo would have been a better choice for Graf Spee .

Also, had Graf Spee left port at this time, the damaged Ajax and Achilles would have been the
only British warships that it would have encountered in the area.

Trap of Montevideo

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



In Montevideo, the 13th Hague Convention came into play. Under Article 12, " ...belligerent
war-ships are not permitted to remain in the ports, roadsteads, or territorial waters of the
said Power for more than twenty-four hours... ", modified by Article 14 " A belligerent
war-ship may not prolong its stay in a neutral port beyond the permissible time except on
account of damage... " British diplomats duly pressed for the speedy departure of the Graf
Spee . Also relevant was Article 16, of which part reads, " A belligerent war-ship may not leave
a neutral port or roadstead until twenty-four hours after the departure of a merchant ship
flying the flag of its adversary. "

The Germans released 61 captive British merchant seamen who had been on board in accordance
with their obligations. Langsdorff then asked the Uruguayan government for two weeks to make
repairs. Initially, the British diplomats in Uruguayâ€”principally Eugen
Millington-Drake â€”tried to have Admiral Graf Spee forced to leave port immediately.
After consultation with London, which was aware that there were no significant British naval
forces in the area, Millington-Drake continued to openly demand that Graf Spee leave. At the
same time, the British secretly arranged for British and French merchant ships to steam from
Montevideo at intervals of 24 hours, whether they had originally intended to do so or not, thus
invoking Article 16. This kept Graf Spee in port and allowed more time for British forces to
reach the area.

At the same time, efforts were made by the British to feed false intelligence to the Germans
that an overwhelming British force was being assembled, including Force H (the aircraft
carrier HMS Ark Royal and the battlecruiser HMS Renown ), when in fact only the heavy cruiser
HMS Cumberland was nearby. Cumberland â€”one of the earlier County class cruisers
â€”was only a little more powerful than Exeter , with two more 8 in (200 mm) guns. She was no
match alone for Admiral Graf Spee , whose guns had much longer range and fired much heavier
shells. Cumberland arrived at 22:00 on 14 December, after steaming at full speed for 36 hours
from the Falkland Islands. Overwhelming British forces (HMS Renown , Ark Royal , Shropshire ,
Dorsetshire , and Neptune ) were en route , but would not assemble until 19 December. For the
time being, the total force comprised the undamaged Cumberland , and the damaged Ajax and
Achilles . To reinforce the propaganda effect, these shipsâ€”which were waiting just
outside the 3 mi (2.6 nmi; 4.8 km) limitâ€”were ordered to make smoke, which could be
clearly seen from the Montevideo waterfront.

The Germans, however, were entirely deceived, and expected to face a far-superior force on
leaving the River Plate. Graf Spee had also used two-thirds of her 11 in (280 mm) ammunition and
only had enough left for approximately a further 20 minutes of firing, which was hardly enough
to fight her way out of Montevideo, let alone get back to Germany.

While the ship was prevented from leaving the harbour, Captain Langsdorff consulted with his
command in Germany. He received orders that permitted some options, but not internment in
Uruguay. The Germans feared that Uruguay could be persuaded to join the Allied cause.
Ultimately, he chose to scuttle his ship in the River Plate estuary on 17 December, to avoid
unnecessary loss of life for no particular military advantage, a decision that is said to have
infuriated Adolf Hitler . The crew of Admiral Graf Spee was taken to Buenos Aires, Argentina ,
where Captain Langsdorff committed suicide on 19 December. He was buried there with full
military honours, and several British officers who were present attended. Many of the crew
members were reported to have moved to Montevideo with the help of local people of German
origin. The German dead were buried in the "Cementerio del Norte" in Montevideo.

Battle of the Atlantic (Skimishes in 1939)

Edit



In 1939, the Kriegsmarine lacked the strength to challenge the combined British Royal Navy
and French Navy ( Marine Nationale ) for command of the sea. Instead, German naval strategy
relied on commerce raiding using capital ships , armed merchant cruisers , submarines and
aircraft. Many German warships were already at sea when war was declared, including most of
the available U-boats and the " pocket battleships " ( Panzerschiffen ) Deutschland and
Admiral Graf Spee which had sortied into the Atlantic in August. These ships immediately
attacked British and French shipping. U-30 sank the liner SS Athenia within hours of the
declaration of warâ€”in breach of her orders not to sink passenger ships. The U-boat
fleet, which was to dominate so much of the Battle of the Atlantic, was small at the beginning of
the war; many of the 57 available U-boats were the small and short-range Type IIs , useful
primarily for minelaying and operations in British coastal waters. Much of the early German
anti-shipping activity involved minelaying by destroyers , aircraft and U-boats off
British ports.

With the outbreak of war, the British and French immediately began a blockade of Germany,
although this had little immediate effect on German industry. The Royal Navy quickly
introduced a convoy system for the protection of trade that gradually extended out from the
British Isles, eventually reaching as far as Panama , Bombay and Singapore . Convoys allowed
the Royal Navy to concentrate its escorts near the one place the U-boats were guaranteed to be
found â€” the convoys. Each convoy consisted of between 30 and 70 mostly unarmed
merchant ships.

Some British naval officials, particularly the First Lord of the Admiralty , Winston
Churchill, sought a more 'offensive' strategy. The Royal Navy formed anti-submarine
hunting groups based on aircraft carriers to patrol the shipping lanes in the Western
Approaches and hunt for German U-boats. This strategy was deeply flawed because a U-boat,
with its tiny silhouette, was always likely to spot the surface warships and submerge long
before it was sighted. The carrier aircraft were little help. Although they could spot
submarines on the surface, at this stage of the war they had no adequate weapons to attack them.
Any submarine found by an aircraft was long gone by the time surface warships arrived. The
hunting group strategy proved a disaster within days. On September 14 1939, Britain's most
modern carrier, HMS Ark Royal , narrowly avoided being sunk when three torpedoes from U-39
exploded prematurely. U-39 was promptly forced to surface and scuttle by the escorting
destroyers, becoming the first U-boat loss of the war. The British failed to learn the lesson:
another carrier, HMS Courageous , was sunk three days later by U-29 .

Escort destroyers hunting for U-boats continued to be a prominent, but misguided, feature of
British anti-submarine strategy for the first year of the war. U-boats nearly always proved
elusive, and the convoys, denuded of cover, were put at even greater risk.

German success in sinking Courageous was surpassed a month later when GÃŒnther Prien in
U-47 penetrated the British base at Scapa Flow and sank the old battleship HMS Royal Oak at
anchor. Prien immediately became a hero in Germany.

In the South Atlantic, British forces were stretched by the cruise of Admiral Graf Spee , which
sank nine merchant ships of 50,000 tons in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans during the
first three months of war. The British and French formed a series of hunting groups including
three battlecruisers , three aircraft carriers, and 15 cruisers to seek the raider and her
sister Deutschland , which was operating in the North Atlantic. These hunting groups had no
success until Graf Spee was caught off the mouth of the River Plate by an inferior British
force. After suffering damage in the subsequent action, she took shelter in neutral
Montevideo harbour and was scuttled on 17 December 1939.

After this initial burst of activity, the Atlantic campaign quieted down. Admiral Karl
DÃ¶nitz , commander of the U-boat fleet, had planned a maximum submarine effort for the
first month of the war, with almost all the available U-boats out on patrol in September. That
level of deployment could not be sustained; the boats needed to return to harbour to refuel,
re-arm, re-stock supplies, and refit. The harsh winter of 1939â€“40, which froze over
many of the Baltic ports, seriously hampered the German offensive by trapping several new
U-boats in the ice. Hitler 's plans to invade Norway and Denmark in the spring of 1940 led to the
withdrawal of the fleet's surface warships and most of the ocean-going U-boats for fleet
operations in Operation WeserÃŒbung .

The resulting Norwegian campaign revealed serious flaws in the magnetic influence pistol
(firing mechanism) of the U-boats' principal weapon, the torpedo . Although the narrow
fjords gave U-boats little room for manoeuver, the concentration of British warships,
troopships and supply ships provided countless opportunities for the U-boats to attack.
Time and again, U-boat captains tracked British targets and fired, only to watch the ships
sail on unharmed as the torpedoes exploded prematurely (due to the influence pistol), or hit
and failed to explode (because of a faulty contact pistol), or ran beneath the target without
exploding (due to the influence feature or depth control not working correctly). Not a single
British warship was sunk by a U-boat in more than 20 attacks. As the news spread through the
U-boat fleet, it began to undermine morale. The director in charge of torpedo development
continued to claim it was the crews' fault. In early 1942, the problems were determined to be
due to differences in magnetic fields at high latitudes [16 ] [ page needed ] and a slow leakage
of high-pressure air from the submarine into the torpedo's depth regulation gear.
Eventually those problems were solved by about March 1941, allowing the torpedos to become a
formidable weapon.

Battle Kollaa

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The Battle of Kollaa was fought from December 7, 1939 - March 13, 1940 in the Ladoga's Karelia,
Finland as a part of the Winter War .

Despite having far fewer troops than the Soviets , the Finnish forces (12th division)
repelled the Red Army because the Soviets were only prepared to proceed along roads . The
Kollaa area had very few roads, all of them guarded by Finnish troops, and the Soviets were not
able to proceed cross-country without skis .

Kollaa is often considered to have been one of the most difficult places to defend during the
Winter War . It has been estimated that the Red Army fired almost 40,000 artillery rounds at the
defence line during a single day, whereas the Finnish Artillery could fire only 1,000 rounds
per day at the very best.

Although they stopped the Red Army, the 12th Division suffered heavy losses, with the Battle
of Kollaa continuing until the end of the Winter War . The Red Army managed to penetrate the
Finnish defence line in Kollaa several times, thus pushing the Finns out of their positions
but the Finns systematically counter-attacked to restore the integrity of their defence
line. The Finnish defence came close to a collapse at the very end of the war - in fact, the
Soviets managed to form a 0,5 - 1,5 kilometers deep fracture point into the Finnish defense
line on March 12. As a result, the commander of the 12th division of the Finnish Army considered
abandoning the main defence line at Kollaa, but as the news from the sector were that the
situation was "not yet that alarming", the commander ordered a counter-attack and the
defence line to be retaken the following day. However, as the information of the concluded
peace treaty reached the front, those orders were cancelled and the men were told to hold their
current positions until the end of hostilities.

A memorable quote from the Battle of Kollaa is Major General HÃ€gglund's question, "Will
Kollaa hold? ( KestÃ€Ã€kÃ¶ Kollaa )", to which Lieutenant Aarne Juutilainen
replied, "Kollaa will hold ( Kollaa kestÃ€Ã€ ), unless the orders are to run."

The legendary sniper Simo HÃ€yhÃ€ served in the Kollaa front.

Battle of Honkaniemi

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



On the nights of February 25 and 26, members of the Jaeger Battalion 3 were carried by trucks to
Heponotko, which was about 3 km away from a depot in Honkaniemi (now Lebedevka) then they skied
to the starting point at 4:00 am. The tank company arrived around 30 minutes later from a 50 km
march. That march, however, cost them more than they would have liked. Since the conditions of
the weather and road were extremely bad, the tank company lost 5 of their 13 Vickers 6-Ton tanks
mostly due to engine failures.

Seeing this as a major blow to their offensive capabilities, Captain Kunnas split his
remaining tanks between the 2nd and 3rd Jaegers Companies and the 1st Jaegers Company. Six
tanks will support the Jaegers while two will help the 1st secure the left flank. It was chosen
that the attack would commence at 5:00 am, but the communication with the artillery
battalions failed so it was decided that they would try again at 6:15 am.

When communications with the artillery battalions were up and running, the time had come to
attack. However another setback had occurred. During the preliminary artillery barrage,
some of the shells landed at the starting point, resulting in the 30 Finns being killed or
injured. The attack had to be postponed by another hour.

The Beginning

Edit



After the initial artillery bombardment by the two artillery battalions (the 1st Battalions
of the 21st and 5th Artillery Regiments) the attack commenced. However, the Finns had had
another set-back, another two tanks had been lost to technical failures thereby reducing the
total Finnish Tanks to only six for the entire battle. Even after all those set-backs, there
was more to come. The 1st Jaegers Battalion had advanced some 200 meters before having to halt
under the tremendous firing powers of the Red Army . The 1st Jaegers Company which was covering
the left flank, advanced foreword towards the railroad only to be unable to cross it. The 2nd
and 3rd Jaegers Companies, which were the main attack forces, had advanced to 200 meters SW
from the rail road, but had to be stopped.

Tank Backup

Edit



The 4th Armoured Company had one of the worst days ever. One of its Vickers tanks got stuck in a
ditch; the turret was damaged in the process and it had to retreat back to the starting point.
The remaining five tanks were lost in a more honourable way, "being targeted by T-26s , T-28s
and the 45 mm AT guns ".

The platoon commander's tank, Lt.V. Mikkola's, advanced the farthest, almost 500 meters,
almost into Soviet areas. Only two Finnish tanks were able to destroy other Soviet tanks, the
tank of Corporal E. SeppÃ€lÃ€, which had kept on fighting after being immobilized, had
taken out two Soviet tanks before the crew had to abandon their vehicle. The other tank was
commanded by 2nd Lt. J. VirniÃ¶, which had destroyed one tank before being damaged.

Finnish Retreat

Edit



Captain Kunnas received orders at 10:00 pm that he was to abort the attack and retreat. The
Finns' first tank battle met with an unsuccessful end. The entire tank battle had been fought
with inexperienced crews and almost no radio communication, since the tanks had been bought
from the UK without guns, optics and radios, and some even without the driver's seat, in order
to save money. Due to the lack of vital equipment, communication between tanks was impossible
and the tanks would act upon their own judgement.

Battle of France - May 10-June 25, 1940

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



In the Second World War , the Battle of France was the German invasion of France and the Low
Countries , beginning on 10 May 1940, which ended the Phoney War . The battle consisted of two
main operations. In the first, Fall Gelb (Case Yellow), German armoured units pushed through
the Ardennes , to cut off and surround the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium. During
the fighting, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and many French soldiers were evacuated
from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo .

In the second operation, Fall Rot (Case Red), executed from 5 June, German forces outflanked
the Maginot Line and pushed deep into France. Italy declared war on France on 10 June and soon
afterwards the French government fled to Bordeaux . France's capital of Paris was occupied on
14 June. On 17 June, Philippe PÃ©tain publicly announced France would ask for an armistice.
On 22 June, an armistice was signed between France and Germany, going into effect on 25 June.
For the Axis Powers , the campaign was a spectacular victory.

Following the Battle of Britain , France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north
and west, a small Italian occupation zone in the southeast, and an unoccupied zone, the zone
libre , in the south. A rump state, Vichy France , administered all three zones according to the
terms laid out in the armistice. In November 1942, the Axis forces also occupied the zone libre
, and metropolitan France remained under Axis occupation until after the Allied landings in
1944. The Low Countries remained under German occupation until 1944 and 1945.

Edit



Germany initiated Fall Gelb on the evening prior to and the night of 10 May. During the late
evening of 9 May, German forces occupied Luxembourg . Army Group B launched its feint
offensive during the night into the Netherlands and Belgium. During the morning of 10 May,
FallschirmjÃ€ger (paratroopers) from the 7th Flieger and 22. Luftlande
Infanteriedivision under Kurt Student executed surprise landings at The Hague , on the road
to Rotterdam and against the Belgian fort at Eben-Emael in order to facilitate Army Group B's
advance.

The French command reacted immediately, sending its 1st Army Group north in accordance with
Plan D. This move committed their best forces, diminishing their fighting power by the
partial disorganisation it caused and their mobility by depleting their fuel stocks. By the
time the French 7th Army crossed the Dutch border, they found the Dutch already in full
retreat, and withdrew into Belgium to protect Brussels .

The Netherlands

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The Luftwaffe was guaranteed air superiority over the Netherlands by sheer numerical
superiority. They allocated 247 medium bombers , 147 fighter aircraft , 424 Junkers Ju 52
transports, and 12 Heinkel He 59 seaplanes to operations over the Netherlands. The Dutch Air
Force, the Militaire Luchtvaartafdeling (ML), had a strength of 144 combat aircraft, half of
which were destroyed within the first day of operations. The remainder was dispersed and
accounted for only a handful of Luftwaffe aircraft shot down. In total the ML flew a mere 332
sorties, losing 110 of its aircraft.

The German 18. Armee secured all the strategically vital bridges in and toward Rotterdam ,
which penetrated Fortress Holland and bypassed the New Water Line from the south. However, an
operation organised separately by the Luftwaffe to seize the Dutch seat of government , known
as the Battle for The Hague , ended in complete failure. The airfields surrounding the city
(Ypenburg, Ockenburg , and Valkenburg) were taken with heavy casualties and transport
aircraft losses. Some 96 aircraft in all were lost to Dutch shell fire. The Luftwaffe' ' s
Transportgruppen operations had cost it 125 Ju 52s destroyed and 47 damaged, representing
50% of the fleet's strength. Moreover, the airborne operation had cost the German
paratroopers 4,000 men, of whom 1,200 were prisoners of war , out of 8,000. The Dutch evacuated
them back to Britain. The total percentage cost of the defeat was 20% of NCOs and men and 42% of
German officers were lost.

The French 7th Army failed to block the German armoured reinforcements from the 9.
Panzerdivision , which reached Rotterdam on 13 May. That same day in the east, following the
Battle of the Grebbeberg in which a Dutch counter-offensive to contain a German breach had
failed, the Dutch retreated from the Grebbe line to the New Water Line. The Dutch Army, still
largely intact, surrendered in the evening of 14 May after the Bombing of Rotterdam by the
Luftwaffe . Heinkel He 111 medium bombers of Kampfgeschwader 54 (Bomber Wing 54) destroyed
the centre of the city, an act which has remained controversial. The Dutch Army considered its
strategic situation to have become hopeless and feared further destruction of the major
Dutch cities. The capitulation document was signed on 15 May. However, Dutch forces
continued fighting in Zeeland and the colonies while Queen Wilhelmina established a
government in exile in Britain. Dutch casualties amounted to 2,157 army, 75 air force, and 125
Navy personnel. 2,559 civilians were also killed.

Invasion of Belgium



The Germans were able to establish air superiority in Belgium. Having completed thorough
photographic reconnaissance missions, they destroyed 83 of the 179 aircraft of the
Aeronautique Militaire within the first 24 hours. The Belgians would fly 77 operational
missions but would contribute little to the air campaign. The Luftwaffe was assured air
superiority over the Low Countries.

Because Army Group B had been so weakened compared to the earlier plans, the feint offensive by
the German 6. Armee was in danger of stalling immediately, since the Belgian defences on the
Albert Canal position were very strong. The main approach route was blocked by Fort
Eben-Emael , a large fortress then generally considered the most modern in Europe,
controlling the junction of the Meuse and the Albert Canal. Any delay might endanger the
outcome of the entire campaign, because it was essential that the main body of Allied troops
was engaged before Army Group A established bridgeheads. To overcome this difficulty, the
Germans resorted to unconventional means in the assault on the fort . In the early hours of 10
May, DFS 230 gliders landed near the fort and unloaded assault teams that disabled the main gun
cupolas with hollow charges . The bridges over the canal were seized by German paratroopers.
The Belgians launched considerable counter attacks which were broken up by the Luftwaffe.
Shocked by a breach in its defences just where they had seemed the strongest, the Belgian
Supreme Command withdrew its divisions to the KW-line five days earlier than planned.
Similar operations against the bridges in the Netherlands, at Maastricht , failed. All were
blown up by the Dutch and only one railway bridge was taken. This stalled the German armour on
Dutch territory for a time.

The BEF and the French First Army were not yet entrenched, and the news of the defeat on the
Belgian border was unwelcome. The Allies had been convinced Belgian reistance would have
given them several weeks to prepare a defensive line at the Gembloux Gap. When General Erich
Hoepner 's XVI Panzerkorps, consisting of 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions , was launched over the
newly-captured bridges in the direction of the Gembloux Gap, this seemed to confirm the
expectations of the French Supreme Command that the German Schwerpunkt would be at that
point. Gembloux was located between Wavre and Namur , on flat, ideal tank terrain. It was also
an unfortified part of the Allied line. In order to gain time to dig in there, RenÃ© Prioux ,
commanding the Cavalry Corps of the French 1st Army, sent two French Light Mechanised
divisions, the 2nd DLM and 3rd DLM, forward to meet the German armour at Hannut , east of
Gembloux. They would provide an advanced guarding screen which would stall the Germans and
allow sufficient time for the French 1st Army to dig into formidable positions.

Battle of Hannut and Gembloux



The resulting Battle of Hannut , which took place on 12-13 May, was the largest tank battle
until that date, with about 1,500 armoured fighting vehicles participating. The French
disabled about 160 German tanks for the loss of 91 Hotchkiss H35 and 30 Somua S35 tanks
destroyed or captured. The Germans controlled the battlefield after a voluntary French
withdrawal. They recovered and eventually repaired or rebuilt many of their knocked-out
tanks so German irreparable losses amounted to just 49 tanks (20, 3rd Panzer and 29, 4th Panzer
). Prioux had achieved his mission in stalling the Panzer s and allowing the French 1st Army to
settle, so it was a tactical victory for the French. By contrast, although Hoepner had
succeeded in diverting the French First Army from Sedan, which was his most important
mission, he failed to destroy or forestall it. The French would escape the encirclement and
still render invaluable support to the British Army in Dunkirk just two weeks later.

On 14 May, having been tactically defeated at Hannut, Hoepner tried to break the French line
again, against orders, leading to The Battle of the Gembloux Gap . This was the only time in the
campaign when German armour frontally attacked a strongly held fortified position. The
attempt was repelled by the 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, costing 4. Panzerdivision
another 42 tanks, 26 of which were irreparable. This French defensive success was made
irrelevant by events further south. Following the battle with the French 1st Army on 15 May,
the war diary of the 4. Panzerdivision noted irreparable losses that day of nine Panzer Is,
nine Panzer IIs, six Panzer IIIs, eight Panzer IVs, and two command tanks; of an original total
of 314. 137 machines, of which 20 were mk IIIs and four were mk IVs, remained combat-ready.

Belgian and French Ardennes

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



In the centre, the progress of German Army Group A was to be delayed by Belgian motorised
infantry and French mechanised cavalry divisions ( Divisions LÃ©gÃšres de Cavalerie )
advancing into the Ardennes. The main resistance came from the Belgian 1st Chasseurs
Ardennais along with the 5th French Light Cavalry Division (DLC). These forces had
insufficient anti-tank capacity to block the surprisingly large number of German tanks they
encountered and quickly gave way, withdrawing behind the Meuse. The German advance was
greatly hampered by the sheer number of troops trying to force their way along the poor road
network. Kleistâ€²s Panzergruppe had more than 41,000 vehicles. This huge armada had
been allocated only four march routes through the Ardennes. The time-tables proved to be
wildly optimistic and there was soon heavy congestion, beginning well over the Rhine to the
east, which would last for almost two weeks. This made Army Group A very vulnerable to French
air attacks, but these did not materialise. Although Gamelin was well aware of the situation,
the French bomber force was far too weak to challenge German air superiority so close to the
German border. The French had tried in vain to stem the flow of the German armour during the
Battle of Maastricht , and failed with heavy losses. In two days, the bomber force had been
reduced to 72 out of 135.

On 11 May, Gamelin had ordered reserve divisions to begin reinforcing the Meuse sector.
Because of the danger the Luftwaffe posed, movement over the rail network was limited to
night-time, slowing the reinforcement, but the French felt no sense of urgency as they
believed the build-up of German divisions would be correspondingly slow. The French Army did
not conduct river crossings unless assured of heavy artillery support. While they were aware
that the German tank and infantry formations were strong, they were confident in their strong
fortifications and artillery superiority. However, the quality of the fighting men was
dubious. The German advance forces reached the Meuse line late in the afternoon of 12 May. To
allow each of the three armies of Army Group A to cross, three major bridgeheads were to be
established at: Sedan in the south, MonthermÃ© to the northwest and Dinant further to the
north. The first German units to arrive hardly had local numerical superiority; their
already insufficient artillery support was further limited by an average supply of just 12
rounds per gun. Fortunately for the German divisions, the French artillery was also limited
to a daily combat supply rate of 30 rounds per "tube" (gun).

Battle of Sedan



At Sedan, the Meuse Line consisted of a strong defensive belt 6 km (3.7 mi) deep, laid out
according to the modern principles of zone defence on slopes overlooking the Meuse valley and
strengthened by 103 pillboxes , manned by the 147th Fortress Infantry Regiment. The deeper
positions were held by the 55th Infantry Division . This was only a grade "B" reserve division.
On the morning of 13 May, the 71st Infantry Division was inserted to the east of Sedan, allowing
55th Infantry to narrow its front by one-third and deepen its position to over 10 km (6.2 mi).
Furthermore, it had a superiority in artillery to the German units present.

On 13 May, the German XIX Korps forced three crossings near Sedan, executed by the 1. , 2. and 10.
Panzerdivision s , reinforced by the elite GroÃŸdeutschland infantry regiment. Instead
of slowly massing artillery as the French expected, the Germans concentrated most of their
air power (as they lacked strong artillery forces) to smash a hole in a narrow sector of the
French lines by carpet bombing and by dive bombing . Hermann GÃ¶ring had promised Guderian
that there would be extraordinarily heavy air support during a continual eight hour air
attack, from 08:00am until dusk . The Luftwaffe executed the heaviest air bombardment the
world had yet witnessed and the most intense by the Germans during the war. The Luftwaffe
committed two Sturzkampfgeschwader (Dive Bomber Wings) to the assault, flying 300 sorties
against French positions. A total of 3,940 sorties were flown by nine Kampfgeschwader
(Bomber Wings).

Some of the forward pillboxes were unaffected, and repulsed the crossing attempts of the 2.
and 10. Panzerdivision s. However, it transpired the morale of the deeper units of the 55th
Infantry had been broken by the impact of the air attacks. The French supporting artillery
batteries had fled. At a cost of a few hundred casualties, the German infantry had penetrated
up to 8 km (5.0 mi) into the French defensive zone by midnight. Even by then, most of the infantry
had not crossed, much of the success being due to the actions of just six platoons, mainly
assault engineers.

The disorder that had begun at Sedan spread down the French lines. At 19:00 on 13 May, the 295th
regiment of 55th Infantry Division, holding the last prepared defensive line at the Bulson
ridge 10 km (6.2 mi) behind the river, was panicked by the false rumour that German tanks were
already behind its positions. It fled, creating a gap in the French defences, before even a
single German tank had crossed the river. This "Panic of Bulson" also involved the divisional
artillery. The Germans had not attacked their position, and would not do so until 12 hours
later, at 07:20 on 14 May. Still, the French had several hours to launch a counter offensive
before the Germans consolidated the bridgeheads, but failed to attack soon enough.

Recognising the gravity of the defeat at Sedan, General Gaston-Henri Billotte , commander of
the 1st Army Group, whose right flank pivoted on Sedan, urged that the bridges across the Meuse
be destroyed by air attack, convinced that "over them will pass either victory or defeat!".
That day, every available Allied light bomber was employed in an attempt to destroy the three
bridges, but failed to hit them while suffering heavy losses. Some 44% of the Allies' bomber
strength was destroyed.

Collapse of the Meuse front



Heinz Guderian, the commander of the German XIX. Armeekorps , had indicated on 12 May that he
wanted to enlarge the bridgehead to at least 20 km (12 mi). His superior, Ewald von Kleist ,
ordered him on behalf of Hitler to limit his moves to a maximum of 8 km (5.0 mi) before
consolidation. At 11:45 on 14 May, von Rundstedt confirmed this order, which implied that the
tanks should now start to dig in. Guderian was able to get to Ewald von Kleist to agree to
"reconnaissance in force", by threatening to resign and behind the scenes interventions.
This vague terminology allowed Guderian to move forward, effectively ignoring Ewald von
Kleist's order to halt.

In the original von Manstein Plan as Guderian had suggested, secondary attacks would be
carried out to the southeast, in the rear of the Maginot Line, to confuse the French command.
This element had been removed by Halder but Guderian now sent the 10th Panzerdivision and
GroÃŸdeutschland infantry regiment south to execute precisely such a feint attack, using
the only available route south over the Stonne plateau. The commander of the French 2nd Army,
General Charles Huntziger , intended to carry out a counterattack at the same spot by the
armoured 3e Division CuirassÃ©e de RÃ©serve (DCR) to eliminate the bridgehead. This
resulted in an armoured collision, both parties trying in vain to gain ground in furious
attacks from 15-17 May, the village of Stonne changing hands many times. Huntzinger
considered this at least a defensive success and limited his efforts to protecting his flank.
Holding Stonne and taking Bulson would have enabled the French to hold onto the high ground
overlooking Sedan. They could disrupt the Sedan bridgehead, even if they could not take it.
Heavy battles took place and Stonne changed hands 17 times. However, on the evening of 17 May,
it fell to the Germans for the last time.

Meanwhile, Guderian had turned his other two armoured divisions, the 1. and 2.
Panzerdivision s , sharply to the west on 14 May. They began to advance at speed to the English
Channel.

On 15 May, in heavy fighting, Guderian's motorised infantry dispersed the reinforcements of
the newly formed French 6th Army in their assembly area west of Sedan, undercutting the
southern flank of the French 9th Army. The 9th Army collapsed, and surrendered en masse . The
102nd Fortress Division, its flanks unsupported, was surrounded and destroyed on 15 May at
the MonthermÃ© bridgehead by the 6. and 8. Panzerdivision s acting without air support. The
French 2nd Army had also been seriously mauled and had rendered itself impotent. The 9th Army
was giving way because they also did not have time to fortify their lines. Erwin Rommel had
breached its defences within 24 hours of its conception. This allowed the impetuous Rommel to
break free with his 7. Panzerdivision , refusing to allow his division rest and advancing both
by day and night. The Ghost division advanced 30 mi (48 km) in just 24 hours.

Rommel's lines of communication with his superior, General Hermann Hoth , and his
headquarters were cut. Disobeying orders and not waiting for the French to establish a new
line of defence, he continued to advance north-west to Avesnes-sur-Helpe , just ahead of the
1. and 2. Panzerdivision s. Rommel was lucky, because the French 5th Motorised Infantry
Division had set up its overnight bivouac in his path, leaving its vehicles neatly lined up
along the roadsides. At this stage, Rommel's tanks dashed right through them. The slow speed,
overloaded crews and lack of any means of communication in battle undid the French. The 5.
Panzerdivision joined in the fight. The French did inflict significant losses on the
division, but they could not cope with the speed of the German mobile units, which closed fast
and dispatched the French armour at close range. During this battle, the remaining elements
of the 1st DCR, resting after losing all but 16 of its tanks in Belgium, were also engaged and
defeated. The French unit retreated, with just three remaining tanks. The 1st DCR was
effectively destroyed on 17 May. The Germans lost 50 out of 500 tanks in the battle.

By 17 May, Rommel claimed to have taken 10,000 prisoners and suffered only 36 losses. Guderian
was delighted with the fast advance, and encouraged his XIX Korps , consisting of the 1., 2. and
10. Panzerdivision s to head for the channel, continuing until fuel was exhausted. However,
the success of his commanders on the ground began to have effects on Hitler who worried that the
German advance was moving too fast. Halder recorded in his diary on 17 May that " Fuhrer is
terribly nervous. Frightened by his own success, he is afraid to take any chance and so would
pull the reins on us ... [he] keeps worrying about the south flank. He rages and screams that we
are on the way to ruin the whole campaign." Through deception and different interpretations
of orders to stop from Hitler and von Kleist, the commanders on the ground were able to ignore
Hitler's attempts to stop the northern advance to the sea.

Low French morale

Edit



The Panzerkorps now slowed their advance considerably and put themselves in a very
vulnerable position. They were stretched out, exhausted, low on fuel, and many tanks had
broken down. There was now a dangerous gap between them and the infantry. A determined attack
by a fresh and large enough mechanised force might have cut the Panzers off and wiped them out.

The French High Command, however, was reeling from the shock of the sudden offensive and was
now stung by a sense of defeatism. On the morning of 15 May, French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud
telephoned the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill and said "We have
been defeated. We are beaten; we have lost the battle." Churchill, attempting to offer some
comfort to Reynaud, reminded the Prime Minister of all the times the Germans had broken
through the Allied lines in World War I only to be stopped. Reynaud was, however,
inconsolable.

Churchill flew to Paris on 16 May. He immediately recognised the gravity of the situation when
he observed that the French government was already burning its archives and was preparing for
an evacuation of the capital. In a sombre meeting with the French commanders, Churchill asked
General Gamelin, " OÃ¹ est la masse de manoeuvre ?" ["Where is the strategic reserve?"] that
had saved Paris in the First World War. " Aucune " ["There is none"] Gamelin replied. After the
war, Gamelin claimed his response was "There is no longer any." Churchill described hearing
this later as the single most shocking moment in his life. Churchill asked Gamelin where and
when the general proposed to launch a counterattack against the flanks of the German bulge.
Gamelin simply replied "inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority of
methods".

Failed Allied Counter-Attacks



Some of the best Allied units in the north had seen little fighting. Had they been kept in
reserve they might have been used in a decisive counter-strike. In a twist of irony, pre-war
General Staff Studies had asserted the main reserves were to be kept on French soil, to resist
an invasion of the Low Countries, deliver a counter attack or "re-establish the integrity of
the original front".

Despite having a numerically superior armoured force, the French failed to use it properly,
or to deliver an attack on the vulnerable German bulge. The Germans combined their fighting
vehicles in major, operational formations and used them at the point of main effort. The bulk
of French armour was scattered along the front in tiny formations. Most of the French reserve
divisions had by now been committed. The 1st DCR had been wiped out when it had run out of fuel and
the 3rd DCR had failed to take its opportunity to destroy the German bridgeheads at Sedan. The
only armoured division still in reserve, 2nd DCR, was to attack on 16 May west of
Saint-Quentin, Aisne . The division's commander could locate only seven of its 12 companies,
which were scattered along a 49 Ã—37 mi (79 Ã—60 km) front. The formation was overrun by
the 8. Panzerdivision while still forming up and was effectively destroyed as a fighting
unit.

Colonel Charles de Gaulle , in command of France's hastily formed 4th DCR, attempted to launch
an attack from the south at Montcornet where Guderian had his Korps headquarters and the 1.
Panzerdivision had its rear service areas. The Germans hastily improvised a defence while
Guderian rushed up the 10. Panzerdivision to threaten De Gaulle's flank. This flank pressure
and attacks by the Luftwaffe ' s VIII Fliegerkorps broke up the attack. French losses on 17 May
were 32 tanks and armoured vehicles, but had "inflicted loss on the Germans". On 19 May, after
receiving reinforcements, De Gaulle made another effort, and was repulsed with the loss of 80
of 155 vehicles. von Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII had done most of the work, by targeting
French units moving into position to attack the vulnerable German flanks it was able to stop
most counter attacks from starting. The defeat of de Gaulle's unit and the disintegration of
the French 9th Army was caused mainly by Richthofen's air units.

Although De Gaulle had achieved a measure of success, his attacks on 17 and 19 May did not
significantly alter the overall situation. It was the only French counter-attack on the
German forces advancing to the channel.

German spearheads reach the Channel



The Allies did little to either threaten the Panzerkorps or to escape from the danger that they
posed. The Panzer troops used 17-18 May to refuel, eat, sleep and return more tanks to working
order. On 18 May, Rommel caused the French to give up Cambrai by merely feinting an armoured
attack toward the city.

On 19 May, General Edmund Ironside , the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff ,
conferred with General Lord Gort, commander of the BEF, at his headquarters near Lens . He
urged Gort to save the BEF by attacking south-west toward Amiens. Gort replied that seven of
his nine divisions were already engaged on the Scheldt River , and he had only two divisions
left with which he would be able to mount such an attack. Ironside then asked Gort under whose
command he was acting. Gort replied that this was General Billotte, the commander of the
French 1st Army Group, but that Billotte had issued no orders for eight days. Ironside
confronted Billotte, whose own headquarters was nearby, and found him apparently incapable
of taking decisive action. He returned to Britain concerned that the BEF was already doomed,
and ordered urgent anti-invasion measures .

The German land forces could not remain inactive any longer since it would allow the Allies to
reorganise their defence or escape. On 19 May, Guderian was permitted to start moving again
and smashed through the weak British 18th and 23rd Territorial Divisions located on the Somme
river. The German units occupied Amiens and secured the westernmost bridge over the river at
Abbeville . This move isolated the British, French, Dutch, and Belgian forces in the north. On
20 May, a reconnaissance unit from Rudolf Veiel â€²s 2. Panzerdivision reached
Noyelles-sur-Mer , 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the west of their positions on the 17th. From
there, they were able to see the Somme estuary and the English Channel. A huge pocket,
containing the Allied 1st Army Group (the Belgian, British, and French 1st, 7th and 9th
Armies), was created.

VIII. Fliegerkorps , under the command of Wolfram von Richthofen , covered the dash to the
channel coast. Heralded as the Ju 87sâ€² ( Stuka ) "finest hour", these units responded
via an extremely efficient communications system to the Panzer Divisionsâ€² every
request for support, which effectively blasted a path for the Army. The Ju 87s were
particularly effective at breaking up attacks along the flanks of the German forces,
breaking fortified positions, and disrupting rear-area supply chains. The Luftwaffe also
benefitted from excellent ground-to-air communications throughout the campaign.
Radio-equipped forward liaison officers could call upon the Stuka s and direct them to attack
enemy positions along the axis of advance. In some cases, the Luftwaffe responded to requests
in 10â€“20 minutes. Oberstleutnant Hans Seidemann (Richthofen's Chief of Staff ) said
that "never again was such a smoothly functioning system for discussing and planning joint
operations achieved". Closer examination reveals the army had to wait 45â€“75 minutes
for Ju 87 units, and just 10 minutes for the Henschel Hs 123 units.

Weygand Plan

Edit



On the morning of 20 May, Maurice Gamelin ordered the armies trapped in Belgium and northern
France to fight their way south and link up with French forces that would be pushing northward
from the Somme river. However on the evening of 19 May, French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud had
dismissed Gamelin for his failure to contain the German offensive, and replaced him with
Maxime Weygand . Weygand had little sense of urgency. He claimed his first mission as
Commander-in-Chief would be to get a good night's sleep. Weygand was guilty of wasting
valuable time, time which was needed to form a quick and powerful counter-attack. He
cancelled Gamelin's planned offensive, then wasted several days making courtesy visits to
dignitaries in Paris. He then ordered a similar plan to Gamelin, proposing a
counter-offensive from the north and south against the German "corridor", which entailed a
combined thrust by the encircled armies in the pocket and French forces on the Somme front (the
newly-created French 3rd Army Group, under the command of General Antoine-Marie-BenoÃ®t
Besson ). The situation demanded an all-out offensive on the corridor.

On 22 May, Weygand ordered his forces to pinch off the German armoured spearhead by combining
attacks from the north and the south. On the map, this seemed like a feasible mission, as the
corridor through which von Kleist's two Panzer Corps had moved to the coast was narrow. On
paper, Weygand had sufficient forces to execute it: to the north were the three DLM and the BEF;
to the south, was de Gaulle's 4th DCR. However, while the German position was far from safe, the
opportunity had been lost. The delays had allowed the Germans to push more infantry divisions
into the corridor and they had pushed further along the channel coast. Weygand flew into the
pocket on 21 May and met General Billotte, commander of the First Army Group, and King Leopold
III of Belgium. The Belgian position on any offensive move was made clear by Leopold. As far as
he was concerned, the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks
and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also made clear that in the rapidly
shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not
expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position in order to keep contact with the Belgian Army,
but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would
be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was
to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports.

Gort doubted the French Army's ability to prevail in the offensive. On 23 May, making matters
worse, Billotte was killed in a road traffic accident , leaving the Allied First Army Group in
the pocket leaderless for three days. Billotte was the only member of the Allied armies
thoroughly informed on the Weygand plan's details. The same day, the British decided to
evacuate from the Channel ports. In the event, communications broke down and only two minor
offensives, by the British at Arras on 21 May and the French at Cambrai on 22 May, would be acted
upon.

Major-General Harold Edward Franklyn , commanding two tank battalions, had moved into the
Arras area. Franklyn was not aware of a French push north toward Cambrai, and the French were
unaware of a British attack heading south, out of the pocket, toward Arras. Ignorant as to the
importance of the operation, Franklyn assumed he was to relieve the Allied garrison at Arras
and to sever German communications in the immediate area. He did not therefore want to risk
throwing his main units, the 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions into the fight, especially if the
objectives were limited. He also had the French 3rd DLM available, from the French 1st Army. It
had caused the German armour severe trouble at the Battle of Hannut with its SOMUA S35 heavy
tanks. They were given no more than a flank protection role. Only two infantry battalions and
two tank battalions were made available for the attack. British armour numbers had dwindled
owing to mechanical failures. However they still fielded 74 Matilda tanks and 14 light tanks.

The resulting Battle of Arras achieved surprise and initial success against German forces
which were stretched, but it still failed. Radio communication between tanks and infantry
was poor and there was little combined arms coordination as practiced by the Germans. In the
end, hastily set up German defences (including 88 mm (3.46 in) FlaK guns and 105 mm (4.1 in)
field guns ) stopped the attack. The French inflicted heavy losses on German armour as they
retreated, but the Luftwaffe broke up the counter-attacks. Just 28 of the 88 British tanks
survived. The French V Corps' attack at Cambrai also failed. V Corps had been too disorganised
after previous fighting in Belgium to launch a serious effort.

Although this attack was not part of any coordinated attempt to destroy the Panzerkorps , the
German High Command panicked even more than Rommel. They thought that hundreds of Allied
tanks were about to smash into their elite forces. It was unjustified panic. The operational
and strategic effects of the British attack was out of proportion to its tactical
achievements. On the morning of the 22 May, the German High Command had regained confidence
and ordered Guderianâ€²s XIX Panzerkorps to press north and push on to the Channel ports:
the 1. Panzerdivision to Calais , the 2. Panzerdivision to Boulogne and the 10.
Panzerdivision to Dunkirk . [182 ] Later, the missions of the 1st and 10. Panzerdivision s were
reversed. The 1. Panzer was ordered to Dunkirk while the 10. Panzer was to take Calais.

Halt Order

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



On 23 May, GÃŒnther von Kluge proposed that the German 4. Armee , which was poised to continue
the attack against the Allied forces at Dunkirk, should "halt and close up". Seeing the Allies
were trapped in the city, Gerd von Rundstedt agreed with von Kluge. In the 4. Armee diary, it is
recorded on 23 May "will, in the main, halt tomorrow [May 24] in accordance with
Colonel-General von Rundstedt's order." General Walther von Brauchitsch , commander in
chief of the German Army, disagreed with his colleagues and wanted to continue the attack
against Dunkirk by putting the 4. Armee under Bock. Bock was busy and Halder agreed with Von
Rundstedt and with von Kluge to stop action against Dunkirk. The disagreement went to Hitler,
who overruled Brauchitsch and agreed with stopping action against Dunkirk. Hitler's error
wasn't in making the command to halt the German army but in allowing the orders already drawn up
by the German generals to stand. It appears that Kleist also agreed with the halt order, which
Hitler "rubber-stamped". The halt order remains extremely controversial.

At the same time, Army Group B under Bock was stripped of most of its divisions, including its
reserves and air support. Its complement shrank to just 21 divisions, while Army Group A
swelled to 70 divisions, including all ten Panzer Divisions. Army Group B was to be used as a
"hammer" against Army Group A's "anvil". Halder later claimed Hitler's motivation for the
transfer was his wish that the decisive battle be fought on French, not Flemish soil.

Hermann GÃ¶ring convinced Hitler that the Luftwaffe could prevent any evacuation and von
Rundstedt warned him that any further effort by the armoured divisions would lead to a much
longer refitting period. The delay and failure of the Luftwaffe to stop the evacuation wasted
some three days (24-27 May) and allowed the Allies to build a defence to the approaches of
Dunkirk, the main evacuation port. It would seem that Hitler, GÃ¶ring and Rundstedt shared
responsibility for the mistake.

Battle of Calais



In the early hours of 23 May, Gort ordered a retreat from Arras. By now, he had no faith in the
Weygand plan, nor in Weygand's proposal to at least try to hold a pocket on the Flemish coast, a
so-called RÃ©duit de Flandres . Gort knew that the ports needed to supply such a foothold
were already being threatened. That same day, the 2. Panzer Division had assaulted Boulogne .
The British garrison there surrendered on 25 May, although significant numbers were
evacuated by Royal Navy ships. The RAF also provided air superiority over the port, denying
the Luftwaffe an opportunity to attack the shipping. Some 4,286 men were evacuated.

The 10. Panzerdivision attacked Calais, beginning on 24 May. British reinforcements (the
3rd Royal Tank Regiment , equipped with cruiser tanks , and the 30th Motor Brigade ) had been
hastily landed 24 hours before the Germans attacked. The defenders held on to the port as long
as possible, aware that an early capitulation would free up German forces to advance on
Dunkirk. The British and French held the town despite the best efforts of Ferdinand Schaal 's
division to break through. Frustrated, Guderian ordered that if Calais had not fallen by
14:00 on 26 May, he would withdraw the 10. Panzer division and ask the Luftwaffe to destroy the
town. Eventually, the French and British ran out of ammunition and the Germans were able to
break into the fortified city at around 13:30 on 26 May, 30 minutes before Schaal's deadline
was up. Despite the French surrender of the main fortifications, the British held the docks
until the morning of 27 May. Around 440 men were evacuated. The Siege of Calais lasted for four
crucial days. However, the delaying action came at a price. Some 60% of Allied personnel were
killed or wounded.

Operation Dynamo

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The Allies launched Operation Dynamo which evacuated the encircled British, French and
Belgian troops from the northern pocket in Belgium and Pas-de-Calais , beginning on 26 May.
About 28,000 men were evacuated on the first day. The French 1st Armyâ€”the bulk of which
remained in Lille â€”owing to Weygand's failure to pull it back along with other French
forces to the coast, mounted a long defence of the city , the 50,000 men finally capitulating on
31 May. While the 1st Army was mounting its sacrificial defence at Lille, it drew German forces
away from Dunkirk, allowing 70,000 Allied soldiers to escape. [ Total Allied evacuation
rates stood at 165,000 on 31 May. The Allied position was complicated by Belgian King
LÃ©opold III 's surrender the following day, which was postponed until 28 May. The gap left
by the Belgian Army stretched from Ypres to Dixmude. Nevertheless, a collapse was prevented
and 139,732 British and 139,097 French soldiers were evacuated. Between 31 May and 4 June,
some 20,000 British and 98,000 French had been saved. Still, some 30-40,000 French soldiers
of the rearguard remained to be captured. The overall total evacuated was 338,226.

During the Dunkirk battle, the Luftwaffe did its best to prevent the evacuation. It flew 1,882
bombing and 1,997 fighter sorties. British losses totalled 6% of their total losses during
the French campaign, including 60 precious fighter pilots. The Luftwaffe failed in its task
of preventing the evacuation, but had inflicted serious losses on the Allied forces. A total
of 89 merchantmen (of 126,518 grt) were lost; the Royal Navy lost 29 of its 40 destroyers sunk or
seriously damaged. The Germans lost around 100 aircraft confirmed destroyed, and the RAF 106
fighters. Other sources put Luftwaffe losses in the Dunkirk area at 240.

Confusion still reigned. After the evacuation at Dunkirk and while Paris was enduring a
short-lived siege, part of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division was sent to Brittany but was
withdrawn after the French capitulation. The British 1st Armoured Division under General
Evans, without its infantry which had earlier been diverted to the defence of Calais, had
arrived in France in June 1940. It was joined by the former labour battalion of the 51st
(Highland) Division and was forced to fight a rearguard action. At the end of the campaign,
Erwin Rommel praised the staunch resistance of British forces, despite being
under-equipped and without ammunition for much of the fighting.

On 26 February 1945, Hitler claimed he had let the BEF escape as a "sporting" gesture, in the
hope Churchill would come to terms. Few historians accept Hitler's word in light of Directive
No. 13, which called for "the annihilation of French, British and Belgian forces in the
[Dunkirk] pocket".

Fall Rot



French Problems

Edit



The best and most modern French armies had been sent north and lost in the resulting
encirclement; the French had also lost much of their heavy weaponry and their best armoured
formations. Overall, the Allies had lost 61 divisions in Fall Gelb . Weygand was faced with the
prospect of defending a long front (stretching from Sedan to the Channel ), with a greatly
depleted French Army now lacking significant Allied support. Weygand had only 64 French and
one remaining British division (the 51st Highland ) available. [210 ] Weygand lacked the
reserves to counter a breakthrough or to replace frontline troops, should they become
exhausted from a prolonged battle on a front of 96 in (2.4 m)965 kilometres. The Germans had 142
divisions to use.

Adding to this grave situation, on 10 June, Italy declared war on France and Britain. The
country was not prepared for war and made little impact during the last twelve days of fighting
. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was aware of this and sought to profit from German
successes. Mussolini felt the conflict would soon end. As he said to the Army's
Chief-of-Staff, Marshal Badoglio , "I only need a few thousand dead so that I can sit at the
peace conference as a man who has fought." However, French General RenÃ© Olry commanding
the Army of the Alps resisted all Italian attacks, and then repulsed German attacks from the
Rhone valley.

Collapse of the Weygand line

Image:

Edit



{C}The Germans renewed their offensive on 5 June on the Somme . During the next three weeks, far
from the easy advance the Wehrmacht expected, they encountered strong resistance from a
rejuvenated French Army. [213 ] It had fallen back on its communications, and had closer
access to repair shops, supply dumps and stores. Moreover, 112,000 evacuated French
soldiers were repatriated via the Normandy and Brittany ports. It was some substitute for the
lost divisions in Flanders. The French were also able to make good a significant amount of its
armoured losses and raised the 1st and 2nd DCR (heavy armoured divisions). De Gaulle's
divisionâ€”the 4th DCRâ€”also had its losses replaced. Morale rose and was very
high by the end of May 1940.

A central explanation for the high morale was threefold; most French soldiers that knew about
the defeats, and were now joining the line, only knew of German success by hearsay; surviving
French officers had increased tactical experience against German mobile units; increased
confidence in their weapons after seeing their artillery, which the Wehrmacht post-battle
anaylsis recognised as technically very good, and their tanks perform better in combat than
the German armour. The French tanks were now known to have heavier armour and armament.

Between 23 and 28 May, they reconstituted the French 7th and 10th Armies. Weygand decided on
hedgehog tactics, which were to implement defence in depth operations, and perform delaying
strategies designed to inflict maximum attrition on enemy units. He employed units in towns
and small villages, as well as major towns and cities, and fortified them 360Â° along their
perimeter. Behind this, the new infantry, armoured, and half-mechanised divisions formed
up, ready to counter attack and relieve the surrounded units, which were ordered to hold out at
all costs.

Army Group B attacked either side of Paris. Of its 47 divisions it had the majority of the mobile
units. In fact, only 48 hours into the offensive, the Germans had not made any major
breakthroughs. The Germans had been "stopped in their tracks". On the Aisne, Erich Hoepner 's
XVI Panzerkorps employed over 1,000 AFVs, two Panzer Divisions and a motorised division
against the French. The assault was crude, and Hoepner soon lost 80 out of 500 AFVs in the first
attack. The German 4. Armee succeeded in capturing bridgeheads over the Somme river, but the
Germans struggled to get over the Aisne . Weygand had organised a defence in depth and
frustrated the crossing. In a series of examples at Amiens , the Germans were repeatedly
driven back by powerful French artillery concentrations, and came to recognise improved
French tactics. Once again, the German Army relied on the Luftwaffe to help decisively, by
silencing French guns and enabling the German infantry to inch forward. German progress was
made only late on the third day of operations, finally forcing crossings. The French Air Force
attempted to bomb them but failed. German sources acknowledged the battle was, "hard and
costly in lives, the enemy putting up severe resistance, particularly in the woods and tree
lines continuing the fight when our troops had pushed passed the point of resistance".
However, south of Abbeville , the French 10th Army under General Robert Altmayer had its front
broken and it was forced to retreat to Rouen and south along the Seine river. The rapid German
advances were the sign of a weakening enemy. Rommel and his 7. Panzerdivision headed west over
the Seine river through Normandy and capturing the port of Cherbourg on 18 June. On the way to
Cherbourg, Rommel forced the surrender of the British 51st (Highland) Division on 12 June. In
close-quarter combat, the Luftwaffe was struggling to have an impact. However, in an
operational sense, they helped disperse French armour. The German spearheads were
overextended and vulnerable to counter strokes, but the concentration of the Luftwaffe
denied the French the ability to concentrate, and the fear of air attack negated their mass and
mobile use by Weygand.

On 10 June, the French government declared Paris an open city . The German 18. Armee now
deployed against Paris. The French resisted the approaches to the capital strongly, but the
line was broken in several places. Weygand now asserted it would not take long for the French
Army to disintegrate. On 13 June, Churchill attended a Allied Supreme War Council Meeting at
Tours . He suggested a union between the two countries. It was rejected. On 14 June, Paris fell.
Those Parisians who stayed in the city found that in most cases the Germans were extremely well
mannered.

On top of this added danger, the situation in the air had also grown critical. The Luftwaffe
established air supremacy (as opposed to air superiority ) as the French air arm was on the
verge of collapse. The French Air Force ( ArmÃ©e de l'Air ) had only just begun to make the
majority of bomber sorties; between 5 and 9 June (during Operation Paula ), over 1,815
missions, of which 518 were by bombers, were flown. The number of sorties flown declined as
losses were now becoming impossible to replace. The RAF attempted to divert the attention of
the Luftwaffe with 660 sorties flown against targets over the Dunkirk area but losses were
heavy; on 21 June alone, 37 Bristol Blenheims were destroyed. After 9 June, French aerial
resistance virtually ceased, some surviving aircraft withdrew to French North Africa . The
Luftwaffe now "ran riot". Its attacks were focused on the direct and indirect support of the
German Army. The Luftwaffe subjected lines of resistance to ferocious assault, which then
quickly collapsed under armoured attack.

Collapse of the Maginot line

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



Meanwhile, to the east, Army Group C was to help Army Group A encircle and capture the French
forces on the Maginot line . The goal of the operation was to envelop the Metz region, with its
fortifications, in order to prevent a French counter offensive from the Alsace region
against the German line on the Somme. Guderian's XIX Korps was to advance to the French border
with Switzerland and trap the French forces in the Vosges Mountains while the XVI Korps
attacked the Maginot Line from the west, into its vulnerable rear to take the cities of Verdun ,
Toul and Metz. The French, meanwhile, had moved the French 2nd Army Group from the Alsace and
Lorraine to the 'Weygand line' on the Somme, leaving only small forces guarding the Maginot
line. After Army Group B had begun its offensive against Paris and into Normandy, Army Groups A
began its advance into the rear of the Maginot line. On 15 June, Army Group C launched Operation
Tiger , a frontal assault across the Rhine river and into France.

German attempts to break open or into the Maginot line prior to Tiger had failed. One assault
lasted for eight hours on the extreme north of the line, costing the Germans 46 dead and 251
wounded, while just two French were killed (one at Ferme-Chappy and one at Fermont fortress).
On 15 June, the last well-equipped French forces, including the French 4th Army were
preparing to leave as the Germans struck. The French now holding the line were skeletal. The
Germans greatly outnumbered the French. They could call upon the I Armeekorps of seven
divisions and 1,000 artillery pieces, although most were First World War vintage, and could
not penetrate the thick armour of the fortresses. Only 88 mm guns could do the job, and 16 were
allocated to the operation. To bolster this, 150 mm and eight railway batteries were also
employed. The Luftwaffe deployed the V Fliegerkorps to give air support.

The battle was difficult and slow progress was made against strong French resistance.
However, each fortress was overcome one by one. One fortress ( Schoenenbourg ) fired 15,802 75
mm rounds at attacking German infantry. It was the most heavily shelled of all the French
positions. Nevertheless, its armour protected it from fatal damage. The same day Tiger was
launched, Operation Kleiner BÃ€r began. Five assault divisions of the VII Armeekorps
crossed the Rhine into the Colmar area with a view to advancing to the Vosges Mountains. It had
400 artillery pieces bolstered by heavy artillery and mortars. They drove the French 104th
and 105th Divisions back into the Vosges Mountains on 17 June. However, on the same day
Guderian's XIX Korps reached the Swiss border and the Maginot defences were cut off from the
rest of France. Most units surrendered on 25 June, and the Germans claimed to have taken
500,000 prisoners. Some main fortresses continued the fight, despite appeals for
surrender. The last only capitulated on 10 July, after a request from General Alphonse Joseph
Georges , and only then under protest. Of the 58 major fortifications on the Maginot Line, just
10 were captured by the Wehrmacht in battle.

        Further information: Operation Cycle and Operation Ariel

    



The evacuation of the second BEF took place during Operation Ariel between 15 and 25 June. The
Luftwaffe , with complete domination of the French skies, was determined to prevent more
Allied evacuations after the Dunkirk debacle. I. Fliegerkorps was assigned to the Normandy
and Brittany sectors. On 9 and 10 June, the port of Cherbourg was subject to 15 t (17 short tons )
of German bombs, whilst Le Havre received 10 bombing attacks which sank 2,949 long tons (2,996
t ) of escaping Allied shipping. On 17 June, Junkers Ju 88s â€”mainly from
Kampfgeschwader 30â€”sank a "10,000 tonne ship" which was the 16,243 long tons (16,504
t) liner RMS Lancastria off St Nazaire, killing some 5,800 Allied personnel. Nevertheless,
the Luftwaffe failed to prevent the mass evacuation of some 190,000â€“200,000 Allied
personnel.

        Main article: Armistice with France (Second CompiÃšgne)

    



Discouraged by his cabinet's hostile reaction to a British proposal to unite France and
Britain to avoid surrender, and believing that his ministers no longer supported him, Prime
Minister Paul Reynaud resigned on 16 June. He was succeeded by Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain ,
who delivered a radio address to the French people announcing his intention to ask for an
armistice with Germany. When Hitler received word from the French government that they
wished to negotiate an armistice, he selected the CompiÃšgne Forest as the site for the
negotiations.

CompiÃšgne had been the site of the 1918 Armistice , which had ended the First World War with a
humiliating defeat for Germany, Hitler viewed the choice of location as a supreme moment of
revenge for Germany over France. The armistice was signed on 22 June 1940 in the very same
railway carriage in which the 1918 Armistice was signed (it was removed from a museum building
and placed on the precise spot where it was located in 1918), Hitler sat in the same chair in
which Marshal Ferdinand Foch had sat when he faced the defeated German representatives.
After listening to the reading of the preamble, Hitler, in a calculated gesture of disdain to
the French delegates, left the carriage, leaving the negotiations to the Chief of Staff of the
OKW, Wilhelm Keitel . The armistice and the cease-fire went into effect at 01:35 on 25 June.

Battle of Britain



The Battle of Britain (German: Luftschlacht um England or Luftschlacht um
GroÃŸbritannien , literally "Air battle for England" or "Air battle for Great Britain") is
the name given to the World War II air campaign waged by the German Air Force ( Luftwaffe )
against the United Kingdom during the summer and autumn of 1940. The objective of the campaign
was to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF), especially Fighter Command . The
name derives from a famous speech delivered by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the House
of Commons : "...the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to
begin."

The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces, and was
also the largest and most sustained aerial bombing campaign to that date. From July 1940
coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres, such as Portsmouth , were the main targets;
one month later the Luftwaffe shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure. As the
battle progressed the Luftwaffe also targeted aircraft factories and ground
infrastructure . Eventually the Luftwaffe resorted to attacking areas of political
significance and using terror bombing tactics .

The failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defences , or
forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or an outright surrender, is considered its first
major defeat and one of the crucial turning points in the war. If Germany had gained air
superiority over England, Adolf Hitler might have launched Operation Sea Lion , an
amphibious and airborne invasion of Britain.

Channel Battle's

Edit



The Kanalkampf comprised a series of running fights over convoys in the English Channel and
occasional attacks on the convoys by Stuka dive bombers . It was launched partly because
Kesselring and Sperrle were not sure about what else to do, and partly because it gave German
aircrews some training and a chance to probe the British defences. These battles off the coast
tended to favour the Germans, whose bomber escorts massively outnumbered the convoy
patrols. The need for constant patrols over the convoys put a severe strain on RAF pilots and
machines. It cost fuel and engine hours and exhausted pilots. Eventually, ship losses became
so great the British Admiralty cancelled all further convoys through the Channel. However,
these early combat encounters provided both sides with experience. They also gave the first
indications some aircraft, such as the Defiant and Bf 110, were not up to the intense
dog-fighting that would characterise the battle.

Main Assault

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The main attack upon the RAF's defences was code-named Adlerangriff ("Eagle Attack").

Poor weather delayed Adlertag ("Eagle Day") until 13 August 1940. On 12 August, the first
attempt was made to blind the Dowding system, when aircraft from the specialist
fighter-bomber unit Erprobungsgruppe 210 attacked four radar stations . Three were briefly
taken off the air but were back working within six hours. The raids appeared to show that
British radars were difficult to knock out. The failure to mount follow-up attacks allowed
the RAF to get the stations back on the air, and the Luftwaffe neglected strikes on the
supporting infrastructure, such as phone lines and power stations, which could have
rendered the radars useless, even if the towers themselves (which were very difficult to
destroy) remained intact.

Adlertag opened with a series of attacks, led again by Epro 210, on coastal airfields used as
forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, as well as 'satellite airfields' (including
Manston and Hawkinge ). As the week drew on, the airfield attacks moved further inland, and
repeated raids were made on the radar chain. 15 August was "The Greatest Day" when the
Luftwaffe mounted the largest number of sorties of the campaign. Luftflotte 5 attacked the
north of England. Believing Fighter Command strength to be concentrated in the south,
raiding forces from Denmark and Norway ran into unexpectedly strong resistance.
Inadequately escorted by Bf 110s, bombers were shot down in large numbers. North East England
was attacked by 65 Heinkel 111s escorted by 34 Messerschmitt 110s, and RAF Great Driffield was
attacked by 50 unescorted Junkers 88s. Out of 115 bombers and 35 fighters sent, 16 bombers and 7
fighters were destroyed. As a result of these casualties, Luftflotte 5 did not appear in
strength again in the campaign.

18 August, which had the greatest number of casualties to both sides, has been dubbed " The
Hardest Day ". Following the grinding battles of 18 August, exhaustion and the weather
reduced operations for most of a week, allowing the Luftwaffe to review their performance.
"The Hardest Day" had sounded the end for the Ju 87 in the campaign. This veteran of Blitzkrieg
was too vulnerable to fighters to operate over Britain, and to preserve the Stuka force,
GÃ¶ring withdrew them from the fighting. This removed the main Luftwaffe
precision-bombing weapon and shifted the burden of pinpoint attacks on the
already-stretched Erpro 210. The Bf 110 proved too clumsy for dogfighting with
single-engined fighters, and its participation was scaled back. It would only be used when
range required it or when sufficient single-engined escort could not be provided for the
bombers.

GÃ¶ring made yet another fateful decision: to order more bomber escorts at the expense of
free-hunting sweeps. To achieve this, the weight of the attack now fell on Luftflotte 2, and
the bulk of the Bf 109s in Luftflotte 3 were transferred to Kesselring's command, reinforcing
the fighter bases in the Pas-de-Calais . Stripped of its fighters, Luftflotte 3 would
concentrate on the night bombing campaign. GÃ¶ring, expressing disappointment with the
fighter performance thus far in the campaign, also made sweeping changes in the command
structure of the fighter units, replacing many Geschwaderkommodore with younger, more
aggressive pilots like Adolf Galland and Werner MÃ¶lders .

Finally, GÃ¶ring stopped the attacks on the radar chain. These were seen as unsuccessful,
and neither the Reichsmarschall nor his subordinates realised how vital the Chain Home
stations were to the defence. It was known that radar provided some early warning of raids, but
the belief among German fighter pilots was that anything bringing up the " Tommies " to fight
was to be encouraged.

The Blitz



The Blitz (from German, "lightning") was the sustained strategic bombing of Britain by Nazi
Germany between 7 September 1940 and 10 May 1941, during the Second World War . The city of
London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 76 consecutive nights and many towns and cities across
the country followed. More than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged, and more
than 40,000 civilians were killed, half of them in London. [3 ]

Other important military and industrial centres such as Glasgow , Belfast , Birmingham ,
Bristol , Cardiff , Coventry , Liverpool , Manchester , Portsmouth , Plymouth , and
Southampton , Swansea , also suffered heavy air attacks and high numbers of casualties.
Bootle and Hull were the most badly damaged cities after London, with a significant
percentage of their buildings destroyed or made uninhabitable. Birmingham and Coventry
were heavily targeted due to the Spitfire and tank factories in Birmingham and the many
munitions factories in Coventry. Both cities were badly damaged, and the city centre of
Coventry was almost completely destroyed.

The bombing did not achieve its intended goals of demoralising the British into surrender or
significantly damaging their war economy. In fact, the eight months of bombing never
seriously hampered British production and the war industries continued to operate and
expand. The Blitz did not facilitate Operation Sea Lion , the planned German invasion of
Britain. By May 1941, the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention
was focused on Operation Barbarossa in the East.

Several reasons have been suggested for the failure of the German air offensive. First, the
Luftwaffe High Command ( Oberkommando der Luftwaffe , or OKL) failed to develop a coherent
long-term strategy for destroying Britain's war industries. It frequently switched from
bombing one type of industry to another, and no sustained pressure was put on any one of them.
Second, the Luftwaffe was not equipped to carry out a long-term strategic air campaign. It was
not armed in depth, and its intelligence on British industry and capabilities was poor. All of
these shortcomings denied the Luftwaffe the ability to make a strategic difference.

Italian conquest of British Somaliland







The Italian force attacking British Somaliland in August 1940 was commanded by Lieutenant
General Guglielmo Nasi , General Officer Commanding Eastern Sector. The force included
twenty-three colonial battalions in five brigades, three Blackshirt battalions, and three
bands ( bande ) of native troops. The Italians also had armoured vehicles (a small number of
both light and medium tanks), artillery, and, most important, superior air support. The
Italians numbered about 24,000.

On Italy's declaration of war in June 1940, the British forces in Somaliland had been placed
under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater , the commander of the
Somaliland Camel Corps . At the start of August, the newly-promoted Brigadier Chater
commanded a contingent of about 4,000 soldiers comprising the lightly armed Somaliland
Camel Corps, the 2nd ( Nyasaland ) Battalion King's African Rifles (KAR), the 1st Battalion
Northern Rhodesian Regiment (KAR), the 3/ 15th Punjab Regiment and 1st East African Light
Battery (four 3.7 in (94 mm) howitzers). They were joined from Aden on 7 August by the 1/ 2nd
Punjab Regiment and 8 August by 2nd Battalion Black Watch . Chaters' force was not only
critically short of artillery but it had no tanks or armoured cars nor did it have any anti-tank
weapons to oppose the Italian medium and light tanks.

Invasion of French Indochina

Edit



{C}{C}{C Within a few hours, columns from the IJA 5th Division under Lieutenant-General
Akihito Nakamura moved over the border at three places and closed in on the railhead at Lang Son
, near Longzhou. This contravened the new agreement. In the Battle of Lang Son , a brigade of
French Indochinese colonial troops and Foreign Legionaires opposed the IJA until 25
September. The Japanese victory opened the way to Hanoi. Still the Vichy French had defenders
in the north and south, and fresh battalions in position on the route from Lang Son to Hanoi.

On 23 September, Vichy France protested the breach of the agreements by the IJA to the Japanese
government.

On the morning of 24 September, Japanese aircraft from aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin
attacked French positions on the coast. A Vichy envoy came to negotiate; in the meantime,
shore defenses remained under orders to open fire on any attempted landing.

On 26 September, Japanese forces came ashore at Dong Tac , south of Haiphong, and moved on the
port. A second landing put tanks ashore, and Japanese planes bombed Haiphong, causing some
casualties. By early afternoon the Japanese force of some 4,500 troops and a dozen tanks was
outside Haiphong.

By the evening of 26 September fighting had died down. Japan took possession of Gia Lam Airbase
outside Hanoi, the rail marshalling yard on the Yunnan border at Lao Cai , and Phu Lang Thuong on
the railway from Hanoi to Lang Son, and stationed 900 troops in the port of Haiphong and 600 more
in Hanoi. Japanese forces remained in Indochina until the end of World War II .

Battle of Dakar

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



On September 23, the Fleet Air Arm dropped propaganda leaflets on the city of Dakar. Then, Free
French aircraft flew off Ark Royal and landed at the airport, but their crews were immediately
taken prisoner. A boat with representatives of de Gaulle entered the port, but were fired
upon. At 10:00, Vichy ships trying to leave the port were given warning shots from Australia .
As the ships returned to port the coastal forts opened fire on Australia . This led to an
engagement between the British fleet and the forts. In the afternoon Australia intercepted
and fired on the Vichy destroyer L'Audacieux , setting it on fire and causing it to be beached.

Also in the afternoon, an attempt was made to set Free French troops ashore on a beach at
Rufisque , to the south-east of Dakar. The attack failed due to fog and heavy fire from
strongpoints defending the beach. General de Gaulle declared he did not want to "shed the
blood of Frenchmen for Frenchmen" and called off the assault.

During the next two days, the Allied fleet continued to attack the coastal defences and the
Vichy forces continued to defend them. Richelieu was hit by two 15" shells from Barham . On the
first day of action guns 7 and 8 in turret number 2 of Richelieu failed on the first round. For day
2, the crews were switched and main turret number 1 was used. Lower propellant charges were
used but these gave a significant reduction in range and caused problems of fire control. Over
the two days Richelieu fired a total of 24 rounds. No hits were recorded by Richelieu .

During these engagements, two Vichy submarines ( PersÃ©e and Ajax ) were sunk, and a
destroyer damaged.

The Allied fleet also suffered damage: Resolution was torpedoed by the BÃ©vÃ©ziers and
Barham was hit by two shells from the coastal defence batteries which had been manned by crew
from the No 1 main turret of Richelieu . Two cruisers were also damaged.

Overall, the Battle of Dakar did not go well for the Allies. The Vichy forces did not back down.
Resolution was so heavily damaged she had to be towed to Cape Town . During most of this
conflict, bombers of the Vichy French Air Force ( ArmÃ©e de l'Air de Vichy ), based in North
Africa , bombed the British base at Gibraltar . On September 24 about 50 aircraft dropped 150
bombs while on September 25 about 100 aircraft dropped 300 bombs on the harbor and dockyards.
Most of the bombs missed. Some damage, but few casualties were caused. Only the British armed
trawler HMT Stella Sirius was sunk by direct hits. Finally, the Allies withdrew, leaving
Dakar and French West Africa in Vichy hands.

Greco-Italian War

PÃ³lemos tou SarÃ¡nda , "War of '40", Italian : Guerra di Grecia , "War of Greece") was a
conflict between Italy and Greece which lasted from 28 October 1940 to 23 April 1941. It marked
the beginning of the Balkans Campaign of World War II. From 6 April 1941 intervention of Nazi
Germany onwards, the conflict is known as the Battle of Greece .

Battle of Pindus

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The primary objective of the Julia Division was to advance towards the Pindus mountain range
and to capture the strategic pass at the town of Metsovo . This move would have a crucial effect
on the outcome of the battle, since it would break the Greek supply lines and separate the Greek
forces in Epirus from those in Macedonia. The Julia Division managed to cover 40 kilometres
(25 mi) of mountain terrain in icy rain and captured the village of Vovousa , but couldn't reach
Metsovo. On November 2, Colonel Davakis, was gravely wounded during a reconnaissance
mission near Fourka , however, it had become clear for the Italians that they lacked the
manpower and the supplies to continue in the face of the arriving Greek reserves.

On November 3, the Italian spearhead, after the initial advance, was surrounded from all
sides. The commander of the Julia Division requested from the Italian headquarters relief
attacks and Italian reserves were thrown into the battle. However, reinforcements from
Albania were unable to reach the cut-off Italian forces and the Julia Division sustained
heavy losses. In the meantime, Greek reinforcements were arriving in the Pindus sector,
while the assistance of the local population, including men, women, and children, was
invaluable. The situation became difficult for the Italians and their pocket came under
pressure from Greek units that had advanced to the area, while the Julia Division was
virtually wiped out. The villages that had been initially captured during the Italian
advance, Samarina and Vovousa , were recaptured by the advancing Greek forces on November 3
and 4. Within less than a week, the remaining Italian troops were in roughly the same positions
they occupied before the declaration of the war.

By 13 November, the entire frontier area had been cleared of Italian units, thereby ending the
Battle of Pindus in a complete Greek victory. Highly significant for the Greek success was the
failure of the Italian air force to disrupt the mobilization and the deployment of the Greek
forces. Due to this factor, the geographical and technical obstacles faced by the Greeks to
transport men and material to the front proved surmountable.

Battle of Gabon

On 8 November 1940, the Shoreham class sloop HMS Milford sank the Vichy submarine Poncelet .
Koenig's force landed at Pointe La Mondah. His forces included French Legionnaires
(including the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade ), Senegalese , and Cameroonian troops.

On 9 November, Lysander aircraft operating out of Douala bombed the Libreville aerodrome.
The aerodrome was eventually captured, despite the stiff resistance encountered by
Koenig's force during their approach. Free French naval forces, including the colonial
sloop Savorgnan de Brazza attacked and sank the Vichy colonial sloop Bougainville .
Bougainville was the sister ship to Savorgnan de Brazza .

On 12 November, the final Vichy forces capitulated at Port Gentil . Governor
Massonâ€”despairing of his actionsâ€”committed suicide.

Battle of Taranto

data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The first wave of 12 A/C led by Lt.-Cdr. M. W. Williamson, 815 Sqn. left Illustrious just before
21:00, followed by a second wave of nine about 90 minutes later. Of the second wave, one turned
back with a problem with its auxiliary fuel tank, and one aircraft launched 20 minutes late,
after requiring emergency repairs to damage from a minor taxiing accident.

The first wave, which consisted of a mixture of six armed with aerial torpedoes and six with
aerial bombs , was split into two sections when three of the bombers and one torpedo bomber
strayed from the main force while flying through thin clouds. The smaller group continued to
Taranto independently. The main group approached the harbor at 22:58. A flare was dropped
east of the harbor and the flare dropper and another aircraft made a dive bombing attack to set
fire to oil tanks. The next three aircraft, led by Lt Cdr K. Williamson RN of 815 Squadron,
attacked over San Pietro Island, and struck the battleship Conte di Cavour with a torpedo that
blasted a 27 ft (8.2 m) hole in her side below her waterline. Williamson's plane was shot down by
the anti-aircraft guns of the Italian battleship. The two remaining aircraft in this
sub-flight continued, dodging barrage balloons and receiving heavy anti-aircraft fire, to
press home an unsuccessful attack on the battleship Andrea Doria . The next sub-flight of
three attacked from a more northerly direction, attacking the battleship Littorio , hitting
it with two torpedoes and launching one torpedo at the flagshipâ€”the battleship
Vittorio Veneto â€”which failed to hit its target. The bomber force led by Capt O. Patch
RN next attacked. They found the targets difficult to identify but attacked two cruisers from
1,500 ft (460 m) followed by another aircraft which straddled four destroyers .

The second wave of 9 A/C led by Lt.-Cdr. J. W. Hale, 819 Sqn.was now approaching, two of the four
bombers also carrying flares, the remaining five carrying torpedoes. Flares were dropped
shortly before midnight. Two

Added by Revan S. Smith aircraft aimed their torpedoes at Littorio , one of which hit home. One
aircraft, despite having been hit twice by anti-aircraft fire, aimed a torpedo at Vittorio
Veneto but that torpedo missed its target. One aircraft hit the battleship Caio Duilio with a
torpedo blowing a large hole in her hull and flooding both of her forward magazines . The
aircraft flown by Lt G. W. L. A. Bayly RN was shot down by the heavy cruiser Gorizia while
following the attack on Littorio , this being the only aircraft lost from the second wave. The
final aircraft to arrive on the scene 15 minutes behind the others made a dive bombing attack on
an Italian cruiser despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, and then made a safe getaway, returning
to Illustrious at 02:39.

Of the two aircraft shot down, the two crew members of the first plane were taken prisoner. The
other two fliers died in their plane.

    The Italian battleships received very heavy damage:

    - Conte di Cavour had a 12 Ã—8 m (39 Ã—26 ft) hole in the hull, and in the six hours
    following the attack all the attempts to save her failed (later, she was raised and
    partially repaired, but never regained service in the Navy, so she was in effect lost that
    night);

    

    - Andrea Doria had only a slightly smaller hole (11 Ã—7 m (36 Ã—23 ft)) and was saved
    by running her aground;

    

    - Littorio had considerable flooding caused by three torpedo strikes. Despite the
    underwater protection (Pugliese system, standard in all the Italian battleships), the
    damage was extensive. She suffered 32 lives lost and many wounded, and the ship was
    totally disabled. She was holed in three places, once on the port side (7 Ã—1.5 m (22 ft
    10 in Ã— 4 ft 10 in)), and twice on the starboard side (15 Ã—10 m (49 Ã—33 ft) and 12
    Ã—9 m (39 Ã—30 ft)). She too was saved by running her aground. Despite this, in the
    morning the ship's bows were totally submerged.

    



Italian defences fired roughly 13,489 shells from the land batteries, while several
thousand were fired from the ships. The anti-aircraft barrage was, at least on paper,
extremely powerful, having 101 guns and 193 machine-guns. There were also 87 balloons, but
strong wind caused the loss of 60 of these. Additionally, only 4.2 km (2.3 nmi; 2.6 mi) of
anti-torpedo nets were actually fielded around the ships, up to 10 m (33 ft) in depth, while the
need was for 12.8 km (6.9 nmi; 8.0 mi). Finally, there were also 13 aerophonic stations and 22
searchlights (ships had two searchlights each).

Later, Littorio was repaired with all available resources, while repairs to the older
battleships proceeded at a much slower pace (seven months for Doria , never completed for
Cavour ). In all, the Swordfish attack was made with just 21 aircraft. Two Italian aircraft
were destroyed by the bombing, and two unexploded ordnance hit cruiser Trento and destroyer
Libeccio . Near misses damaged destroyer Pessagno .

In the meanwhile, X-Force cruisers attacked an Italian convoy . This force had three cruisers
( HMS Ajax , Orion and HMAS Sydney ) and two Tribal -class destroyers ( HMS Nubian and Mohawk ).
Just past midnight, they met and destroyed four Italian merchantmen ( Capo Vado , Catalani ,
Locatelli and Premuda ), damaging the torpedo-boat Fabrizi , while the auxiliary cruiser
RAMB III fled.

Cunningham and Lyster wanted to strike Taranto again the next night with Swordfish (six
torpedo-bombers, seven bombers, and two flare-dispensers), but bad weather prevented the
action.

Hundred Regiments Offensive

Edit



The Japanese North China Area Army estimated the strength of communist regulars to be about
88,000 in December 1939. Two years later, they revised the estimate to 140,000. On the eve of
the battle, the Communist forces grew to 400,000 men strong, in 115 regiments. The
extraordinary success and expansion of the 8th Route Army against the Japanese had Zhu De and
the rest of the military leadership hoping that they could engage the Japanese army and win.

Added by Revan S. Smith By 1940, growth was so impressive that Zhu De ordered a coordinated
offensive by most of the communist regulars (46 regiments from the 115th Division, 47 from the
129th, and 22 from the 120th) against the Japanese-held cities and the railway lines linking
them. From 20 August-10 September, communist forces attacked the railway line that
separated the communist base areas, chiefly those from Dezhou to Shijiazhuang in Hebei ,
Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan in central Shanxi , and Taiyuan to Datong in northern Shanxi.

They succeeded in blowing up bridges and tunnels and ripping up track, and went on for the rest
of September to attack Japanese garrisons frontally. About 600 mi (970 km) of railways were
destroyed, and the Chingching coal mineâ€”which was important to the Japanese war
industryâ€”was rendered inoperative for six months. It was the greatest victory the
CCP fought and won during the war.

However, from October to December, the Japanese responded in force, reasserting control of
railway lines and conducting aggressive "mopping up operations" in the rural areas around
them.

Edit



The Battle of Koh Chang took place on 17 January 1941 during the French-Thai War and resulted in
a decisive victory by the French over the Royal Thai Navy . During the battle, a flotilla of
French warships attacked a smaller force of Thai vessels, including a coastal battleship .

In the end, Thailand lost two ships sunk and one heavily damaged and grounded. Within a month of
the engagement, the Vichy French and the Thais negotiated a peace which ended the war.

Background

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The Royal Thai Navy had been modernized with the recent acquisition of vessels from Japan and
Italy. The major units of the fleet included two Japanese-built armoured coast defence
vessels, which displaced 2,500 long tons (2,500 t) and carried 8 in (200 mm) guns, two older
British-built armoured gunboats with 6 in (150 mm) guns, 12 torpedo boats and four
submarines.

Thai Navy;

In addition, the Royal Thai Air Force had in its inventory over 140 aircraft, including
relatively modern Mitsubishi Ki-30 light bombers , which saw extensive service against the
French. These aircraft in themselves were quite capable of causing severe damage to any
French naval mission which might be mounted. Other less capable aircraft in the Thai
inventory included P-36 Hawk fighters , 70 Chance-Vought O2U-2 Corsair biplanes, six Martin
B-10 bombers and several Avro 504 trainers.

French Navy;

Despite the strengths of the Thai forces the French Governor General of Indochina and
Commander-in-Chief Naval Forces, Admiral Jean Decoux , decided that the naval mission
should go ahead. A small squadron, the Groupe Occasionnel, was formed on 9 December 1940 at Cam
Ranh Bay , near Saigon, under the command of Capitaine de Vaisseau RÃ©gis BÃ©renger.

The squadron consisted of the light cruiser Lamotte-Piquet , the avisos Dumont d'Urville PG
77 (2) and Amiral Charner PG 81 (2) , and the older avisos Tahure and Marne . There was no air cover
to speak of, apart from eight Loire 130 seaplanes based at Ream which provided
reconnaissance. Additional scouting was provided by three coastal survey craft, and
intelligence gleaned from the local fishermen.

BÃ©renger's squadron began training manoeuvres in Cam Ranh Bay shortly after coming
together. Early in the new year, on 13 January 1941, Admiral Decoux formally requested
BÃ©renger to send the squadron against the Thais to act in support of a land offensive
planned for 16 January. This operation was intended to throw back Thai forces which had been
advancing along the coast. Because of the disparate speeds of the French ships, BÃ©renger
sent the slower sloops on ahead, while he remained in Saigon to complete the final elements of
the plan.

Several options were currently being prepared, the Admiralty in Paris having recently given
its formal blessing to the use of naval forces in support of the army. The final planning
meeting of the 13th saw an immediate delay in the execution of the operation for 24 hours. With
the plans finalised, BÃ©renger sailed in Lamotte-Picquet , the delay in the start of the
operation allowing him to refuel at Cap St. Jacques before the rendezvous with the slower
ships at 16:00 on the 15th, 20 mi (17 nmi ; 32 km ) North of Poulo Condore .

The orders from Admiral Decoux were simple: "attack the Siamese coastal cities from Rayong to
the Cambodian frontier to force Siamese government to withdraw its forces from the Cambodian
frontier". On the evening of the 15th, following a final conference on board the flagship, the
squadron weighed anchor at 21:15 and closed the Thai coast at 14 kn (16 mph; 26 km/h), the best
speed of the sloops. The French ships remained undetected as they entered the Gulf of Siam , but
their quarry was not as fortunate. The Loire 130s from Ream had completed a sweep of the coast
from Trat to Sattahib . They had located one coast defence ship and two torpedo boats at Koh
Chang , and one gunboat, four torpedo boats and two submarines at Satahib.

Their report was sent to Marine Headquarters in Saigon, who re-transmitted the report to the
Lamotte-Picquet . BÃ©renger considered his options and decided on a dawn attack on the Thai
ships at Koh Chang. He ignored Sattahib because the sloops could not reach there until later in
the day, by which time the element of surprise would have been lost. Also, the contribution the
harbour defences at Satahib could make was unknown. Moreover, the force at Koh Chang was the
weaker of the two and offered the best chance of victory.

BÃ©renger's plan of attack was as follows. The squadron would approach at dawn from the
South West. Because the anchorage at Koh Chang was surrounded by islands and islets, many of
which were over 200 metres high, the squadron would break up and use the cover of the islands to
concentrate fire on portions of the Thai squadron whilst covering all the avenues of escape.
The easternmost channel was regarded as the most likely route by which a breakout would be made
â€” this was the most suitable route and was also the area in which the recce report had
placed the largest Thai ships. Lamotte-Picquet would head to the eastern side of the
anchorage to block this route whilst the colonial sloops blocked the centre and pounded the
Thai ships there. The smaller French ships would concentrate to the West.

Edit



The French squadron closed on the anchorage at 05:30 on 17 January. At 05:45, they split into
the three groups as planned, Lamotte-Picquet heading for the eastern part of the anchorage,
Dumont d'Urville and Amiral Charner continuing to the central position and Tahure and Marne
heading for the western side. Conditions were perfect â€” the weather was fine, the seas
calm and almost flat. Sunrise was due at 06:30, and the scene was lit only by the first rays of
light on the horizon and by the dim moonlight.

A final aerial reconnaissance of the target area had been arranged using one of the Ream-based
Loire 130s. Lamotte-Picquet carried two such aircraft, but these could not be launched due to
catapult problems. At 06:05, the Loire 130 overflew the anchorage and reported two torpedo
ships. This came as a nasty surprise to the French â€” previous reports led them to
believe that only one of the torpedo boat was present, but during the night, HTMS Chonburi had
arrived to relieve Chantaburi , which was to return to Satahib later that day for repairing.

Once their presence had been passed to Lamotte-Picquet the aircraft attempted an attack of
its own using bombs, but was forced off by a heavy barrage of AA fire. The effect of this mission
was double edged â€” the French were now aware that they faced both the Thai units, but the
element of surprise had been wasted and there was still thirty minutes to go until sunrise.
Caught napping by the oncoming French the Thais desperately began to raise steam and prepared
to slip their anchors, but the torpedo boats were sunk by gunfire from Lamotte-Picquet .

At 06:38, the lookouts in Lamotte-Picquet spotted the coastal defence ship HTMS Thonburi ,
heading northwest, at a range of 10,000 metres (11,000 yd). A running battle ensued, with the
fire of both ships frequently blocked by the towering islets. The fire from the Thai ship was
heavy, but inaccurate. By 07:15, fires could be seen on Thonburi , which then found herself
engaged not only by the cruiser but also by the sloops. In the beginning of the engagement, a
lucky shot from Lamotte-Picquet killed the captain of Thonburi , Commander Luang Phrom
Viraphan , and disrupted her operations. Believing they had a better chance of hurting the
smaller French ships the Thais shifted their fire onto Admiral Charner , which soon found 8 in
(200 mm) salvoes falling around her.

Thonburi shifted fire back to Lamotte-Picquet after a salvo from the French cruiser put her
after turret out of action. Soon she reached the safety of shallow water which the French ships
could not enter for fear of grounding, but it all came too late for the hapless Thais as Thonburi
was burning fiercely and listing heavily to starboard. Her remaining turret was manned and
hand and could not fire unless the maneuvers of the ship put it in appropriate position. At
07:50, Lamotte-Picquet fired a final salvo of torpedoes at 15,000 metres (16,000 yd), but
lost sight of Thonburi behind an island from which she was not seen to emerge.

For the next hour, the French ships patrolled the area, picking up survivors and ensuring
their victory was total. At 08:40, BÃ©renger ordered the squadron to head for home, but this
coincided with the start of the expected Thai air attacks. Thai planes dropped several bombs
close to Lamotte-Picquet and scored one hit, although the bomb failed to explode.
Lamotte-Picquet ' s anti-aircraft guns put up a vigorous barrage and further attacks were not
pressed home. The final raid departed at 09:40, after which the victorious French squadron
returned to Saigon.

Battle of Litani River



The Battle of the Litani River (9 June 1941) was a battle of the Second World War that took place
between during the advance on Beirut during the Syria-Lebanon campaign . The Australian 7th
Division , commanded by Major-General John Lavarack , crossed the Litani River and later
clashed with Vichy French troops.

During the first hour of 8 June 1941, Australian forces in northern Palestine crossed the
border into southern Lebanon . Guides from the Palmach supported many of the lead units.
Initial resistance from Vichy forces south of the Litani River was scattered and generally
disorganised.

The 21st Australian Brigade advanced along the coast road heading for Beirut and attempted to
cross the Litani River. The crossing was stubbornly contested by the Vichy French . The
Australians came under fire from two Vichy French destroyers , the GuÃ©pard and the Valmy .
Australian artillery had to drive off the warships which had come inshore to shell the
advancing troops.

On 9 June, because the bridge over the Litani River was destroyed by Vichy French, two platoons
of the Australian 7th Division had to cross the Litani River in canvas boats. They crossed the
river successfully and captured several Vichy French positions on the far shore.

The British No. 11 (Scottish) Commando , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel R.L.Pedder
(Highland Light Infantry) who was subsequently killed in action during the operation, were
transported by the HMS Glengyle landing ship. On 9 June, after a delay caused by rough seas, the
commandos landed on the coast near the Litani River and led the crossing.

Battle of Damascus



The plan called for the troops of 5th Indian Brigade to advance northwards from their
positions at Aartouz on the Quneitra to Damascus road cross country west of the road towards
Mezzeh . Mezzeh was a large village on the junction with the Beirut to Damascus road, some 3
miles west of Damascus. Their supplies, ammunition and anti-tank element would follow
closely behind on the road proper. Meanwhile, the Free French forces would advance along the
KissouÃ© - Damascus road to capture Qadim as a preliminary to entering Damascus, some

Added by Revan S. Smith four miles further north.

At 20.30 on 18 June, the Indian troops set out and skirmished their way north. They reached
Mezzeh at 04.15. By 05.30, after an hour of fierce hand to hand fight, Mezzeh was captured.
However, there was a major problem: the equipment and anti-tank guns travelling up the main
road had earlier got ahead of the infantry and run into a Vichy roadblock where most of the
vehicles were knocked out. Furthermore, the planned advance by the Free French to Qadim had
been delayed so that the Vichy forces were able to concentrate on the Mezzeh action, applying
intense pressure on the Allied position whilst thwarting any attempt to relieve them and
bring in vitally needed anti-tank weapons.

On 19 June, Maj.-Gen. John Evetts , commander of British 6th Infantry Division , arrived to
relieve Lloyd and take control of the Allied forces east of Merdjayoun. With the depletion
suffered by the Indian brigade he requested that British 16th Infantry Brigade be detached
from 7th Australian Division and sent to his sector.

By nightfall on 19 June, the Allied position at Mezzeh was desperate. Ammunition was running
low, no food had been eaten for 24 hours, casualties were severe, and medical supplies
exhausted. During the night (when Vichy attacks were suspended) three men managed to reach
Gentforce headquarters with the news of the position in Mezzeh. Early on 20 June, Brigadier
Lloyd, having handed over to Evetts, resumed command of 5th Indian Brigade and sent a force
comprising two companies from the 3/ 1st Punjab Regiment , two companies of French Marines and
a battery of artillery to fight its way through to Mezzeh. But they could not blast a way through
and they progressed only slowly against determined opposition from French tanks. A Free
French attack on Qadim the previous night had failed expensively so that they were unable to
exert pressure on Qadim that morning to draw Vichy forces away from Mezzeh. That night,
however, the Free French with support from British anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns and an
Australian machine-gun battalion, advanced against light Vichy defences and captured
Qadim in the morning of 21 June.

Through the night of 19â€”20 June, the Indian defenders at Mezzeh had continued to hold
out. By 13.30 on 20 June, with ammunition exhausted and having had no rations for 50 hours, they
were being shelled at point blank range. A decision was made to ask for a truce to evacuate the
wounded, to try to buy time for the relieving column (which could be heard fighting in the
distance) to reach them. However, the white flag was mis-read as a signal of surrender by the
Vichy forces who rushed the positions of the remaining bayonet-wielding defenders and
overpowered them. The relieving column, reinforced by a battalion of Australian infantry,
recaptured Mezzeh at 19.00 that evening to find it empty save for the dead.

By noon on 21 June, the Allied forces were in Damascus and the Vichy forces were retreating west
along the Beirut road.

Battle of Beirut

Edit



The Battle of Beirut (12 July 1941) marked the end of hostilities in the Syria-Lebanon
campaign of World War II .

On 8 July, even before the fall of Damour , the Vichy French commanderâ€”General Henri
Dentz â€”had sought an armistice: the advance on Beirut together with the Allied
capture of Damascus in late June and the rapid advance of Allied troops into Syria from Iraq in
early July to capture Deir ez Zor and then push on towards Aleppo had made the Vichy position
untenable. At one minute past midnight on 12 July, a ceasefire came into effect. For all
intents and purposes, this ended the campaign and an armistice was signed on 14 July at the "
Sidney Smith Barracks" on the outskirts of the city of Acre .

The triumphant entry of the Australian 7th Division into Beirut successfully established
the Allied occupation of Lebanon. Beirut later became an important Allied base for
Mediterranean naval operations.

Battle of Keren

Edit



The Battle of Keren ( Cheren ) was fought as part of the East African Campaign during World War II
. The Battle of Keren was fought from 5 February-1 April 1941 between the colonial Italian army
defending Eritrea and the invading British and Commonwealth forces. In 1941, Keren was a town
located in the Italian colony of Eritrea. Keren was of strategic importance to both the
Italian and the British forces. The road and railway routes through Keren were the key to
access the city of Asmara (colonial capital of Eritrea) and the Red Sea port of Massawa .

Added by Revan S. Smith Keren where the Ponte Mussolini had been blown and the approaches to the
river heavily mined. By noon on 2 February, however, they were across the river and winding up
the Ascidera Valley until brought to a halt at the Dongolaas Gorge, some 4 mi (6.4 km) from
Keren, where the road had been blocked by the retreating Italians who had blown the
overhanging crags to fill the gorge with boulders and rocks.

4th Indian Division's 11th Indian Infantry Brigade arrived on 3 February, and having made
reconnaissance the next day, launched their offensive to the left of the gorge on 5 February.
The 2nd Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders fought their way to the top of the ridge, feature 1616,
in front of Sanchil and the next night, 6 February, the 3/ 14th Punjab Regiment passed through
them and advanced onto Brig's Peak but were counter attacked by elements of the 65 Infantry
Division "Savoia Grenadiers" ( Granatieri di Savoia ) who forced them from their newly taken
positions back toward Cameron Ridge which was being reinforced by 1 (Wellesley's)/ 6th
Rajputana Rifles . The ridge became a focus of fighting for the next ten days. The ridge was
overlooked in front by Sanchil, to the left by Mount Sammana and even from behind by other
mountains along the Ascidera Valley. The Cameron Highlanders and Rajputana Rifles narrowly
hung on to their positions despite being under near constant attack and having to carry all
food, water and ammunition up 1,500 ft (460 m) across the exposed terrain.

By 6 February, 4th Indian Division's 5th Indian Infantry Brigade had arrived. On 7 February,
they attacked the Dologorodoc feature east of the gorge, looping right through the
Scescilembi Valley (sarcastically renamed the Happy Valley by the attacking troops) and
then thrusting from the south east towrd the ridge joining Mount Zelele and Mount Falestoh,
known as Acqua Col. On the night of 7 February, a company of the 4(Outram's)/ 6th Rajputana
Rifles â€”led by Subadar Richhpal Ram (who had assumed command when the company
commander had been wounded)â€”took the col and held it until 04:30 when they ran out of
ammunition and were driven back to the rest of the battalion on a lower feature. In turn, later
on 8 February and having spent most of the day under heavy artillery and mortar fire, they were
obliged to withdraw back to their starting positions.

Second battle: 10 - 13 February

Edit



On the afternoon of 10 February, 3/ 1st Punjab Regiment attacked Brig's Peak and by the morning
of 11 February were on top of Sanchil. However, the requirement for men to handle and carry
supplies, ammunition and wounded meant there were only two platoons to hold the feature.
Having endured heavy shelling and mortar fire throughout the day, they were forced off
Sanchil and Brig's Peak with heavy casualties by a determined counter attack from the Savoia
Grenadiers. Once again the attackers were thrown onto desperate defence on Cameron Ridge.

Despite the failure by the Punjabis to hold the important observation posts on Sanchil, the
renewed attack on Acqua Colâ€”planned for 12 Februaryâ€”went ahead. 5th Indian
Infantry Division 's 29th Indian Infantry Brigade was brought up from Barentu and put under
command of 4th Division's Major-General Beresford-Peirse and held in readiness to exploit
the hoped-for break-through. At 05:30, supported by an intensive artillery barrage, 4/6th
Rajputana Rifles once again led the way. This time, Richhpal Ram was less fortunate and having
gained the crest, had a foot blown off and shortly thereafter was mortally wounded. He was
awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his exploits on the Col. Meanwhile, the 4/ 11th Sikh
Regiment were pushing up around the side of Acqua Col but the overall attack could not be
carried through, lacking the extra impact that might have come from the 2/ 5th Mahratta Light
Infantry which had been diverted to reinforce the hard-pressed defences on Cameron Ridge.

Third battle: 15 - 27 March

Edit



Platt decided to pause, regroup and train before making a further attempt at Keren. In order to
free up road transport to bring forward the necessary stockpiles for a new attack, 5th Indian
Division returned to Kessala where it could be maintained by the railhead for a period of
intensive training until such time as preparations were complete and the division could be
brought forward again for the offensive. Skinners Horse and most of the Motor Machine Gun
companies assembled in front of Arressa and Adi Ugri to pose a threat to the Italian line of
reinforcement to Keren. From the north, Briggs Force â€”consisting of two battalions
from 4th Indian Division's 7th Indian Infantry Brigade and two Free French
battalionsâ€”had arrived under Brigadier Briggs , the 7th Indian Brigade commander.
After crossing the border into Eritrea on the Red Sea coast, Briggsforce had captured Karora
and then moved south to take Kubkub. On 1 March, the force had broken through the Mescelit pass
some 15 mi (24 km) northeast of Keren. Briggsforce provided not only a third potential
direction of attack to occupy the Keren defenders but also created a threat to Massawa on the
coast and pinning valuable reserves there.

Plan of Attack

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



The scene was set for a set-piece battle with Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirse 's 4th
Indian Infantry Division concentrated on the Sanchil side of the gorge and Lewis Heath 's 5th
Indian Infantry Division, brought forward from Kessala once again, on the Happy Valley side.
The Keren defences had been reinforced with the arrival of 6th Colonial Brigade from Metemma
and also the 11th Blackshirt Battalion of the Savoia Grenadiers. The defenders now totaled
25,000 strong facing an attacking force which had grown to more than 13,000.
Beresford-Pierce would launch 11th Brigade, expanded to five battalions under command,
against the peaks of the Sanchil mass and 5th Brigade against Mount Sammana on the left of his
front.

On the 5th Division front, the Italian reinforcements on Dologorodoc meant Happy Valley was
dominated by the defenders and the attackers' artillery had had to be withdrawn from their
forward positions in the valley to safer locations. Without the artillery, it was no longer
considered practical to continue the flanking attack through Acqua Col to threaten the
Dologorodoc lines of supply. Instead, Major-General Lewis Heath determined that Fort
Dologorodoc would be the key objective for his Indian 5th Infantry Division. Gaining the fort
would not only give the attacking forces the artillery observation post to direct fire on both
sides of the gorge but would expose the reverse slopes of the Dologorodoc mass (which had been
immune to his artillery fire and so a haven to the defenders for supplies and reserves) to
direct fire from the fort.

The two offensives were planned to take place one after the other on 15 March so that the full
force's artillery could be employed for the preliminary bombardment of them both. At the
final meeting on 14 March with his commanders Platt said:

Do not let anybody think this is going to be a walkover. It is not. It is going to be a bloody
battle: a bloody battle against both enemy and ground. It will be won by the side which lasts
longest. I know you will last longer than they do. And I promise you I will last longer than my
opposite number.

At 07:00 on 15 March, the British and Commonwealth troops of 4th Indian Infantry Division
attacked from Cameron Ridge making for Sanchil, Brig's Peak, Hog's Back and the three peaks of
Mount Sammana. That night, the battle ebbed and flowed with attack and counter-attack
inflicting very heavy casualties on both sides.

Meanwhile, on the right, 5TH Indian Infantry Division launched its attack on the Dologorodoc
feature at 10:30 on 15 March. 2nd Highland Light Infantry led the attack on the lower features
("Pimple" and "Pinnacle") but made no progress in the daylight because of fire from the
overlooking Sanchil peak where the Italian defenders had resolutely beaten off the 11th
Brigade assault. They were pinned down, taking casualties and without supply until darkness
provided the opportunity to withdraw.

Added by Revan S. Smith

By moonlight that evening, the attack on Dologorodoc was taken up by 9th Brigade, now
commanded by the recently promoted Brigadier Messervy. Heath and Messervy planned a near two
battalion attack on Pimple and Pinnacle with a third battalion ready to pass through and
strike for the fort.

The capture of Pinnacle that night by the 3/5th Mahratta Light Infantry led by
Lieutenant-Colonel Denys Reid (with 3/ 12th Frontier Force Regiment less two companies
under command to take Pimple ) is described by Compton Mackenzie in Eastern Epic , his official
history of the British Indian Army during the war, as

one of the outstanding small actions of World War II, decisive in its results and formidable in
its achievement... Next morning Messervy scrambled up Pinnacle to congratulate Reid and his
Mahrattas and wondered how they had been able to scramble up with their equipment against
fierce opposition, when he was finding it a pretty tough job without [either]... At the top,
when he saw the victors, he was overcome by the splendor of their feat and his combative amber
eyes filled with tears.



In the early hours of 16 February, the defenders of Fort Dologorodoc made a fierce
counterattack on Pinnacle and Pimple which went on for several hours. Crucially, this left
the defences at the fort weakened and whilst the counter attack was taking place, the 2nd West
Yorkshire Regiment had made their way over a seemingly impossible knife-edge to surprise the
fort's defenders and after a savage fight the fort was captured by 06:30 with 400 prisoners
taken. Finally, Platt had the artillery observation point so greatly needed.

Through 16 March, the Italians repeatedly counterattacked whilst 29 Brigade made an
unsuccessful attack in the evening to Falestoh and Zeban which was abandoned after dark on 17
March after a day exposed to blistering heat, fierce fighting and no supply. For the next 10
days, the 5th Indian Division position at Fort Dologorodocâ€”exposed to the enemy on
three sidesâ€”was subject to intense fighting as the Italians threw in more new units in
ultimately unsuccessful attempts to regain this key position.

Meanwhile on the Sanchil feature 4th Division, having been given 10th Indian Infantry
Brigade under command, continued to batter away to no avail. On the night of 17 March, having
sustained heavy losses, they withdrew from the slopes of Sanchil and Brig's Peak and the
damaged 10th Brigade returned to 5th Division to reform. 4th Indian Division continued to
hold Hog's Back and Flat Top. Over the next three days, the Italian forces continued to make
fierce counter-attacks on both sides of the gorge involving desperate, often hand to hand,
fighting.

Final Assault

Edit



Platt and his commanders decided that the supreme attack should be made through the Dongolaas
Gorge. Heath felt that because of its physical defensive advantages, the Italians may have
neglected their defenses. On the nights of 16/17 and 17/18 March, escorted engineers
reconnoitered the road block and attempted to make a start to clear it. This failed because of
interfering fire from the Italian lines. However, the information gathered made clear to
Heath that the key to the gorge was not Sanchil but two smaller features (informally named the
Railway Bumps ) which overlooked the roadblock and could be approached with much less
opposition along the railway line from the tunnel below Cameron Ridge.

An attack on the defenders at the head of the gorge was planned to give the sappers and miners the
48 hours they needed free of interference from mortar and machine gun fire required to clear
the road. For this Heath would need his full division and had to wait until 10th Brigade had
refitted after its mauling on the Sanchil feature. The plan was for 10th Brigade to advance
into the gorge whilst 9th Brigade (which was holding the Fort Dologorodoc positions) would
move down to take three smaller hills overlooking the far end of the gorge and 29th Brigade
would then attack to take Mount Zeban and beyond it to the east Mount Canabai, which looked down
on Keren and guarded the road to Asmara. Command of 10th Brigade was taken over by one of Heath's
divisional staff officers, Thomas "Pete" Rees while his predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel
Bernard Fletcher was released to form Fletcher Force , a mobile force comprising Central
India Horse and 12 Matilda II tanks , which would be used to exploit the planned break-through
in the gorge and move rapidly into the defenders' rear position and attack their reserves.

On 24 March, diversionary attacks were made on Sanchil while just before midnight the West
Yorkshires and the 3/5th Mahrattas in Fort Dologorodoc moved down to take the lower hills
overlooking the gorge. The West Yorkshires were able to take their hill unopposed but the
Mahrattas met heavy opposition which was well dug-in. However, by 07:30 all three hills were
taken and the gorge's defenses on its south eastern side silenced.

At 03:00 on 25 March, the 2nd Highland Light Infantry and the 4/ 10th Baluch Regiment on their
right advanced from the shelter of the railway tunnel, previously cleared by the sappers and
miners, up the gorge. A 100-gun artillery bombardment was raining down on the ridge on Sanchil
above (to suppress any defensive fire from this dominating height) and the attack in the gorge
achieved complete surprise, with the defenders' attention focused on Sanchil. The 3/ 2nd
Punjab Regiment then advanced between the Baluchis and the West Yorkshire's to clear the
gorge. By 05:30, the railway bumps and most of the objectives were captured and the defenders
no longer held positions from which to direct fire into the gorge below.

The sappers and miners laboured on the road while the battles on the Sanchil and Dologorodoc
features continued. By midday on 26 March, they had completed remaking the road through the
gorge.

In the early hours of 27 March, the British artillery turned onto Zeban and Falstoh. 29th
Brigade passed through 9th Brigade's positions to launch their attack at 04:30, but when they
made their assault they found the defenders had withdrawn and were able to occupy Falestoh
Ridge and the two Zeban summits unopposed.

The Italian position was now untenable and by first light the Royal Air Force was reporting
their withdrawal along the road from Keren to Asmara. The defenders on the Sanchil ridge were
less fortunate and now effectively cut off the Savoia Grenadiers and Bersaglieri were left
with no option but surrender. Fletcher Force was in Keren by 10:30 and was then sent in pursuit
along the Asmara road.

Battle of Cape Matapan



The Battle of Cape Matapan ( Greek : Î�Î±Ï…ÎŒÎ±Ï‡Î¯Î± Ï„Î¿Ï…
Î€Î±Î¯ÎœÎ±Ï�Î¿Ï…) was a Second World War naval battle fought from
27â€“29 March 1941. The cape is on the southwest coast of Greece 's Peloponnesian
peninsula. A force of British Royal Navy ships accompanied by several Royal Australian Navy
ships, under command of British Admiral Andrew Cunningham , intercepted and sank or severely
damaged the ships of the Italian Regia Marina under Admiral Angelo Iachino . The opening
actions of the battle are also known in Italy as the Battle of Gaudo .

Prelude

Edit



    The Allied force was the British Mediterranean fleet, consisting of the aircraft
    carrier HMS Formidable , the modernised World War I battleships HMS Barham , Valiant and
    Warspite (as flagship ). The main fleet was accompanied by two flotillas of destroyers :

    - 10th Flotilla: HMS Greyhound , Griffin and HMAS Stuart commanded by Commander Hec.
    Waller, RAN

    

    

    - 14th Flotilla: HMS Jervis , Janus , Mohawk and Nubian commanded by Philip Mack

    



Also present were HMS Hotspur and Havock .

A second force, under Admiral Sir Henry Pridham-Wippell , consisted of the British light
cruisers HMS Ajax , Gloucester and Orion , the Australian light cruiser HMAS Perth and the
British destroyers HMS Hasty , Hereward and Ilex . The Australian HMAS Vendetta had returned
to Alexandria .

In addition, Allied warships attached to convoys were available: HMS Defender , Jaguar and
Juno waited in the Kithira Channel and Decoy , Carlisle , Calcutta , Bonaventure and HMAS
Vampire were nearby.

The Italian fleet was led by Iachino's vessel, the modern battleship Vittorio Veneto . It also
included almost the entire Italian heavy cruiser force: Zara (under Vice-Admiral Carlo
Cattaneo), Fiume and Pola ; four destroyers of the 9th Flotilla ( Alfredo Oriani , GiosuÃ©
Carducci , Vincenzo Gioberti and Vittorio Alfieri ). The heavy cruisers Trieste (carrying
Vice-Admiral Luigi Sansonetti ), Trento and Bolzano were accompanied by three destroyers of
the 12th Flotilla ( Ascari , Corazziere and Carabiniere ), plus the light cruisers Duca degli
Abruzzi (Vice-Admiral A. Legnano) and Giuseppe Garibaldi (7th cruiser division) and two
destroyers of the 16th Flotilla (namely Emanuele Pessagno and Nicoloso de Recco ) from
Brindisi . [2 ] None of the Italian ships had radar, although several Allied ships did.

The 13th Flotilla of Italian destroyers, Alpino , Bersagliere , Fuciliere , Granatiere was
also involved screening the flagship.

Edit



On 27 March, Vice-Admiral Pridham-Wippellâ€”with the cruisers Ajax , Gloucester ,
Orion and Perth and a number of destroyersâ€”sailed from Greek waters for a position
south of Crete. Admiral Cunningham with Formidable , Warspite , Barham and Valiant left
Alexandria on the same day to meet the cruisers.

The Italian Fleet was spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat at noon, thus Iachino lost the
advantage of surprise. The Italian Admiral also learned that Formidable was at sea thanks to
the decryption team aboard Vittorio Veneto . Nevertheless, after some discussion, the
Italian headquarters decided to go ahead with the operation, in order to show the Germans
their will to fight and confidence in the higher speed of their warships.

Action off Gavdos

Edit

On 28 March, an IMAM Ro.43 floatplane launched by Vittorio Veneto spotted the British cruiser
squadron at 06:35. At 07:55, the Trento group encountered Admiral Pridham-Wippell's
cruiser group south of the Greek island of Gavdos . The British squadron was heading to the
southeast. Thinking they were attempting to run from their larger ships, the Italians gave
chase, opening fire at 08:12 from 24,059 yd (22,000 m). The Italian guns had trouble grouping
their rounds, which had little effect. The rangefinders also performed poorly, with the
exception of those of Bolzano . After an hour of pursuit, the Italian cruisers broke off the
chase and turned northwest, under orders to rejoin Vittorio Veneto . The Allied ships also
reversed course, and followed the Italians at extreme range. Iachino's plan was to lure the
British cruisers into the range of Vittorio Veneto ' s guns.

At 10:55, Vittorio Veneto met the Italian cruisers, and immediately opened fire on the
shadowing Allied cruisers. She fired 94 rounds from a distance of 25,153 yd (23,000 m), all
well aimed, but again with the excessive spreading of her individual salvoes. The Allied
cruisers, until then unaware of the presence of a battleship, withdrew, suffering slight
damage from 15 in (380 mm) shell splinters. A series of photographs showing the Italian
salvoes falling around the Allied warships and taken from HMS Gloucester was published by
Life magazine on 16 June 1941.

Air-Attacks

Edit



By this point, Cunningham's forces, which had been attempting to join up with
Pridham-Wippell's, had launched a sortie of Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers from HMS
Formidable at 09:38. They attacked Vittorio Veneto without direct effect, but the required
manoeuvring made it difficult for the Italian ships to maintain their pursuit. Realising
that they might not be so lucky next time, Iachino broke off the pursuit at 12:20, retiring
towards his own air cover at Taranto .

A second sortie surprised the Italians at 15:09. Lieutenant-Commander Dalyell-Stead flew
his Albacore to 1,094 yd (1,000 m) from Vittorio Veneto , hitting her outer port propeller and
causing 4,000 long tons (4,100 t) of water

Added by Revan S. Smith to be taken on. The ship stopped while damage was repaired, but was able
to get underway again at 16:42, making 19 kn (22 mph; 35 km/h). Cunningham heard of the damage to
Vittorio Veneto , and started to pursue her. Dalyell-Stead and his crew were killed when their
aircraft was shot down.

A third strike by six Albacores and two Swordfish from 826 and 828 Squadrons on Formidable
â€”as well as two Swordfish from 815 Squadron on Creteâ€”was made between 19:36
and 19:50. A torpedo, apparently dropped by Lieutenant F.M.A. Torrens-Spence , crippled the
cruiser Pola , forcing her to stop. Unaware of Cunningham's pursuit, a squadron of cruisers
and destroyers were ordered to return and help Pola , formed on Pola ' s sister ships , Zara and
Fiume . The squadron did not start to return towards Pola until about an hour after the order had
been given by Iachino, officially due to communication problems, while Vittorio Veneto and
the other ships continued to Taranto.

Night Action

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



At 20:15, HMS Ajax ÂŽs radar picked up a ship six miles to port, apparently dead in the water;
she was the crippled Pola . The bulk of the Allied forces detected the Italian squadron on radar
shortly after 22:00, and were able to close without being uncovered. Italian ships were not
supposed to meet enemy ships by night and had their main gun batteries disarmed; they also had
no radar and could not detect British ships by means other than direct sight. They managed to
spot the Allied squadron at 22:20, which they thought to be Italian ships. Therefore the
British battleships Barham , Valiant and Warspite were able to close to 3,828 yd (3,500 m)
unnoticed by the Italian ships â€“ extremely close range for battleship guns â€“
from where they opened fire. The Allied searchlights illuminated their enemy. Some British
gunners witnessed the cruiser's main turrets popping up dozens of metres into the air. After
just three minutes, two Italian heavy cruisersâ€” Fiume and Zara â€”had been
destroyed. Fiume sank at 23:30, while Zara was finished off by a torpedo from the destroyer HMS
Jervis at 02:40 of 29 March.

Two Italian destroyers, Vittorio Alfieri and GiosuÃ© Carducci , were sunk in the first five
minutes. The other two destroyers, Gioberti and Oriani , managed to escape, the former with
heavy damage. Towing Pola to Alexandria as a prize was considered, but daylight was
approaching and it was thought that the danger of enemy air attack was too high. The British
boarding parties seized a number of the much needed Breda anti-aircraft machine guns.

Pola was eventually sunk with torpedoes by the destroyers Jervis and Nubian after her crew was
taken off, shortly after 04:00. The only known Italian reaction after the shocking surprise
was a fruitless torpedo charge by some destroyers and the aimless fire of one of Zara ' s 40 mm
guns in the direction of the British warships.

The Allied ships took on survivors, but left the scene in the morning, fearing Axis air
strikes. Admiral Cunningham ordered a signal to be made on the Merchant Marine emergency
band. This signal was received by the Italian High Command. It informed them that due to air
strikes the Allied ships had ceased their rescue operations, and it granted safe passage to a
hospital ship for rescue purposes. The location of remaining survivors was broadcast and the
Italian hospital ship Gradisca came to recover them.

Allied casualties during the battle were a single torpedo bomber shot down by Vittorio Veneto
' s 3.5 in (89 mm) anti-aircraft batteries, with the loss of the three-man crew. Italian losses
were up to 2,303 sailors, most of them from Zara and Fiume . The Allies rescued 1,015 survivors,
while the Italians saved another 160.

Battle of Denmark Strait



The Battle of the Denmark Strait was a Second World War naval battle between ships of the Royal
Navy and the German Kriegsmarine , fought on 24 May 1941. The British battleship HMS Prince of
Wales and the battlecruiser HMS Hood fought the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy
cruiser Prinz Eugen , both of which were attempting to break out into the North Atlantic to
destroy Allied merchant shipping.

Less than 10 minutes after the British opened fire, a shell from Bismarck struck Hood near her
aft ammunition magazines. Soon afterwards Hood exploded, and sank within three minutes with
the loss of all but three of her crew. Prince of Wales continued to exchange fire with Bismarck
but suffered serious malfunctions in her main armament as the battleship had not fully worked
up after being completed in late March 1941. This, combined with the effects of the battle,
caused her to break off the engagement. Bismarck , damaged but still very much operational,
declined to chase Prince of Wales and instead headed for the Atlantic along with Prinz Eugen .

Plan gone Awry

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



Holland's battle plan was to have Hood and Prince of Wales engage Bismarck while Suffolk and
Norfolk engaged Prinz Eugen (which, Holland assumed, still steamed behind Bismarck and not
ahead of her). He signalled this to Captain John C. Leach of Prince of Wales but did not radio
Rear Admiral Frederic Wake-Walker , who as Commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron directed
Suffolk and Norfolk for fear of disclosing his location. Instead, he observed radio silence .
Holland hoped to meet the enemy at approximately 02:00. Sunset in this latitude was at 01:51.
Bismarck and Prinz Eugen would be silhouetted against the sun's afterglow while Hood and
Prince of Wales could approach rapidly, unseen in darkness, to a range close enough not to
endanger Hood with plunging fire from Bismarck . The Germans would not expect an attack from
this quarter, giving the British the advantage of surprise.

This plan's success depended on Suffolk ' s continually unbroken contact with the German
ships. Suffolk lost

Added by Revan S. Smith contact, however, beginning at 00:28. For 90 minutes, Holland neither
sighted the enemy nor received any further news from Norfolk or Suffolk . Reluctantly, he
ordered Hood and Prince of Wales to turn south-south-west while the destroyers would
continue searching to the north.

Before contact was re-established, the two squadrons missed each other by a hairsbreadth.
Had the German ships not altered course to the west at 01:41 to follow the line of the Greenland
icepack, the British would have intercepted them much earlier than they did. The British
destroyers were just 10 mi (8.7 nmi; 16 km) to the southeast when the Germans made this course
change. Had visibility not been reduced to 3â€“5 mi (2.6â€“4.3 nmi;
4.8â€“8.0 km), the German ships would likely have been spotted.

Just before 03:00, Suffolk regained contact with Bismarck . Hood and Prince of Wales were 35 mi
(30 nmi; 56 km) away, slightly ahead of the Germans. Holland signalled to steer toward the
Germans and increased speed to 28 kn (32 mph; 52 km/h). Suffolk ' s loss of contact had placed the
British at a disadvantage. Instead of the swiftly closing head-on approach Holland had
envisioned, he would have to converge at a wider angle, much more slowly. This would leave Hood
vulnerable to Bismarck ' s plunging shells for a much longer period. The situation worsened
further when, at 03:20, Suffolk reported that the Germans had made a further course
alteration to the west, placing the German and British squadrons almost abeam of each other.

At 05:35, lookouts on Prince of Wales spotted the German ships 17 mi (15 nmi; 27 km) away. The
Germans, already alerted to the British presence through their hydrophonic equipment ,
picked up the smoke and masts of the British ships 10 minutes later. Holland at this point had
the option of joining Suffolk in shadowing Bismarck and waiting for Tovey to arrive with King
George V and other ships to attack or to order his squadron into action, which he did at 05:37.
The rough seas in the Strait kept the destroyers' role to a minimum. The cruisers Norfolk and
Suffolk would be too far behind the German force to reach the battle.

The Battle Begins

Edit



Hood opened fire at 05:52 at a distance of approximately 26,500 yd (24,200 m). Holland had
ordered firing on the leading ship, Prinz Eugen , believing from her position that she was
Bismarck . Holland soon amended his order and directed both ships to engage the rear ship,
Bismarck . Prince of Wales had already correctly identified and targeted Bismarck , whereas
Hood is believed to have continued to fire at Prinz Eugen for some time.

Holland, himself a gunnery expert, was well aware of the danger posed by Hood ' s weak
horizontal protection. Therefore, he wanted to reduce the range as quickly as possible. At a
shorter range, the trajectory of Bismarck ' s shells would be flatter and they would be more
likely to hit the sides of the ship rather than the decking, or to glance off the top deck.
However, he closed the range at an angle that placed the German ships too far forward of the
beam. This meant he could use only 10 of his capital ships' 18 heavy guns while presenting the
Germans more at which to aim than necessary. Those 10 guns became nine when a defect in one of
Prince of Wales ' forward guns rendered it inoperative after the first salvo. Both Suffolk and
Norfolk attempted to engage Bismarck during the action, but both were out of range and neither
cruiser had a sufficient speed advantage over Bismarck to rapidly close the range during the
brief engagement.

The Germans also had the weather gauge , meaning the British ships were steaming into the wind,
spray drenching the lenses of Prince of Wales "A" turret' 42 ft (13 m) Barr and Stroud
coincidence rangefinder and both British ships' "B" turret 30 ft (9.1 m) rangefinders. This
necessitated using smaller 15 ft (4.6 m) rangefinders in the director towers instead. In
addition, Admiral Holland had Prince of Wales stay close to Hood , conforming to Hood ' s
movements instead of varying course and speed. This made it easier for the Germans to find the
range to both British ships, although it would have aided Holland's gunners if they had both
fired upon Bismarck as originally planned, since they could then precisely time each other's
salvos to avoid mistaking one ship's fire for the other. They could also use Concentration
Fire , where both ships' main armament salvos would be controlled by one ship's fire control
computer, probably Prince of Wales' modern Admiralty Fire Control Table .

Prince of Wales struck her target first. She would ultimately hit Bismarck three times. One
shot struck the commander's boat and put the seaplane catapult amidships out of action (the
latter damage not being discovered until much later, during an attempt to fly off the ship's
War Diary on the eve of her final battle). The second shell passed through the bow from one side
to the other without exploding. The third struck the hull underwater and burst inside the
ship, flooding a generator room and damaging the bulkhead to an adjoining boiler room,
partially flooding it. These last hits two caused damage to Bismarck ' s machinery and medium
flooding. More importantly, the damage to the bow cut access to the forward fuel tanks' 1,000
long tons (1,000 t) of fuel oil. It also caused Bismarck to trail a visible oil slick and reduced
her speed by 2 kn (2.3 mph; 3.7 km/h). Bismarck was soon listing 9Â° to port and her bow lost 2 m
(6.6 ft) of freeboard.

The Germans held fire until 05:55, when both German ships targeted Hood . Admiral LÃŒtjens
did not immediately give the order to commence firing. After multiple inquiries by Bismarck '
s first gunnery officer KorvettenkapitÃ€n Adalbert Schneider , " Frage Feuererlaubnis
"? (Permission to open fire?) did the commander of Bismarck KapitÃ€n zur See Ernst
Lindemann impatiently respond: " Ich lasse mir doch nicht mein Schiff unter dem Arsch
wegschieÃŸen. Feuererlaubnis! " (I'm not letting my ship get shot out from under my arse.
Open fire!) A shell hit Hood ' s boat deck, starting a sizable fire in the ready-use 4 in (100 mm)
ammunition stored there, but this fire did not spread to other areas of the ship or cause the
later explosion. Although unconfirmed, it is possible that Hood was struck again at the base
of her bridge and in her foretop radar director.

There has been some contention over which German vessel struck Hood at this time. Prinz Eugen ,
under the command of KapitÃ€n zur See Helmuth Brinkmann , was targeting Prince of Wales by
this stage, following an order from the fleet commander. However, Prinz Eugen ' s Gunnery
Officer, Paul Schmalenbach is quoted as confirming that Prinz Eugen' s target was Hood .

Sinking of Hood

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



At 06:00, Holland ordered his force to turn once again to port to ensure that the aft main guns on
both Hood and Prince of Wales could bear on the enemy. During the execution of that turn, a salvo
from Bismarck , fired at a range of about 9 mi (7.8 nmi; 14 km), was seen by men aboard Prince of
Wales to straddle Hood abreast her mainmast. It is likely that one 15 in (380 mm) shell struck
somewhere between Hood ' s mainmast and "X" turret aft of the mast.

This was immediately followed by a huge pillar of flame that shot upward like a giant
blowtorch, in the vicinity of the mainmast. This was followed by an explosion that destroyed a
large portion of the ship from amidships clear to the rear of "Y" turret. The ship broke into
two. The stern broke away and sank. The bow, pointed upward and pivoting about, followed
shortly thereafter. The forward turret did manage to fire one last salvo while upwards,
possibly from the doomed gun crew, just before the bow section sank.

Splinters rained down on Prince of Wales .5 mi (0.43 nmi; 0.80 km) away. Hood sank in about three
minutes, taking 1,415 men, including Vice-Admiral Holland, with her. Only three of her crew (
Ted Briggs , Bob Tilburn and Bill Dundas) survived to be rescued two hours later by the
destroyer HMS Electra .

The British Admiralty later concluded that the most likely explanation for the loss of Hood
was a penetration of her magazines by a single 15 in (380 mm) shell from Bismarck , causing the
subsequent catastrophic explosion. Recent research by submersible craft suggests that the
initial explosion was in the after 4 in (100 mm) magazine and that it spread to the 15 in (380 mm)
magazines via the ammunition trunks.

It has been suggested from examination of the wreckage, found in 2001, that the magazine
explosion in the 4 in (100 mm) armament near the mainmast caused the vertical blast of flame
seen there, and this in turn ignited the magazines of the aft 15 in (380 mm) guns that caused the
explosion that wrecked the stern. This explosion might have travelled through the starboard
fuel tanks, igniting the fuel oil there, setting off the forward magazines and completing the
destruction of the ship. The wreck of Hood revealed the bow section bereft of any structure and
a huge section of its side is missing, from the 'A' barbette to the foredeck. The midship
section had its plates curled outward. Moreover, the main parts of the forward structure
including the 600 long tons (610 t) conning tower were found about 1.1 km (0.59 nmi; 0.68 mi)
away from the main wreckage. This has sparked theories that the 15 in (380 mm) forward
magazines exploded as a result of the force, flames and pressure, caused by the detonation of
the aft magazines. A team of marine forensic scientists has found that implosion damage to the
forward hull due to the rapid sinking of the Hood, is the most likely cause of the state of the
forward hull, and they do not support any theory that the forward magazines exploded.

Prince of Wales Alone

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



Prince of Wales found herself steering towards the sinking Hood . Her commanding officer,
Captain Leach, ordered an emergency avoidance turn away from Hood ' s wreckage. This violent
change of course disrupted her aim and put her in a position that made it easier for the Germans
to target her. She resumed her previous course, but was now under the concentrated fire of both
German ships.

Prince of Wales was struck four times by Bismarck and three times by Prinz Eugen . One shell
passed through her upper superstructure , killing or wounding several crewmen in the Compass
Platform and Air Defence Platform. Pieces of another shell struck her radar office aft,
killing crewmen within. An 8 in (200 mm) shell from Prinz Eugen found its way to the propelling
charge/round manipulation chamber below the aft 5.25 in (133 mm) gun turrets, and a 15 in (380
mm) shell from Bismarck hit underwater below the armour belt, and penetrated about 13 ft (4.0
m) into the ship's hull, about 25 ft (7.6 m) below the waterline, but was stopped by the
anti-torpedo bulkhead. Fortunately for Prince of Wales , neither shell exploded, but she
still suffered minor flooding and the loss of some fuel oil. Contrary to some mistaken
opinion, the 15 in (380 mm) shell that struck Prince of Wales below the waterline did not
endanger her magazines, as it came to rest abreast an auxiliary machinery room.

By this time, serious gunnery malfunctions had caused intermittent problems with the main
armament, leading to a 26% reduction in output. Captain Leach realised that continuing the
action would risk losing Prince of Wales without inflicting further damage on the enemy. He
therefore ordered the ship to make smoke and withdraw, 'pending a more favourable
opportunity'. Prince of Wales turned away just after 06:04, firing from her rear turret under
local control until the turret suffered a jammed shell ring, cutting off the ammunition
supply and making the guns inoperable. Despite efforts by crew members and civilian
technicians to repair the shell ring, all four guns were not back in service until 08:25,
although two of the four guns were serviceable by 07:20.This temporarily left only five 14 in
(360 mm) guns operational, but nine of the ten were operational in five hours. The final salvos
fired were ragged and are believed to have fallen short. She retired from the battle around
06:10. Thirteen of her crew were killed, nine wounded. The timing of Prince of Wales '
withdrawal was fortunate for her, as she had come into torpedo range of Prinz Eugen and turned
away as the German cruiser was about to fire.

Breaking of Action

Image:
data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



On Bismarck , there was tremendous elation at the sinking of Hood . There was also a keen
expectation that they would close on Prince of Wales and possibly finish her off. Bismarck ' s
captain â€” KapitÃ€n zur See Ernst Lindemann â€” requested that
GroÃŸadmiral LÃŒtjens allow Bismarck to do just that. KaptitÃ€n Lindemann was a
master naval gunner and knew he had Prince of Wales within reach. Even if British Admiral John
Tovey 's squadron had left Scapa Flow the previous day, he would still be more than 300 nmi (350
mi; 560 km) away from Bismarck even after diverting to sink Prince of Wales â€” a chase
Lindemann figured would take only two or three hours. LÃŒtjens refused to allow Lindemann
to give chase, giving no explanation. Lindemann repeated his request, this time more
assertively. LÃŒtjens held firm to orders from the German Naval Commander â€”
GroÃŸadmiral Erich Raeder â€” to avoid unnecessary combat with the Royal Navy,
especially when it could lead to further damage that could hasten delivering Bismarck toward
the waiting hands of the enemy. He broke off combat instead of pursuing Prince of Wales and
ordered a course of 270Â°, due west. Bismarck had fired 93 of her 353 base-fused Armour
Piercing (AP) shells during the engagement.

This clash between the two senior German officers reflected their disparate and distinct
command functions. As commander of Bismarck , Lindemann operated first and foremost as a
tactician. As such, he had no question about his ship's immediate objective to destroy Prince
of Wales , and he had pressed his case as far and hard as he should. LÃŒtjens, as fleet chief and
task force commander, operated at the strategic and operational levels. To some degree, his
orders were clear â€” attacking convoys was his priority, not risking "a major
engagement for limited, and perhaps uncertain, goals." Nevertheless, Raeder had also
ordered LÃŒtjens to be bold and imaginative, to accept battle if unavoidable and conduct it
vigorously to the finish.

The bottom line was that LÃŒtjens' orders did not cover a spectacular success like the one
just achieved. His priority therefore was to stick to his instructions, focus on sinking
merchant shipping and avoid encounters with enemy warships whenever possible. Moreover,
before leaving Germany, LÃŒtjens had told Admirals Conrad Patzig and Wilhelm Marschall ,
that he would adhere to Raeder's directives. This meant he did not intend to become the third
fleet chief to be relieved for contradicting Raeder's orders; Marschall, one of his two
predecessors, had been relieved of command for not following his orders to the letter despite
the fact that Marschall's analysis of the changes in the tactical situation since the orders
were issued resulted in the sinking of the British aircraft carrier HMS Glorious and its two
escorting destroyers. Nor was he predisposed to discuss his command decisions with a
subordinate officer.

Even if he had known it was the untried Prince of Wales he was fighting and not King George V ,
LÃŒtjens would probably have stuck to his decision. Following her would have meant
exposing the squadron to further gunfire as well as to torpedo attacks from Norfolk and
Suffolk . He would have risked his ships and crews on an expressly forbidden opportunity.

Between 06:19 and 06:25, Suffolk fired six salvoes in the direction of Bismarck , having
mistaken Bismarck for a radar contact with an aircraft. Suffolk was actually out of gun range
of both Bismarck and Prinz Eugen at the time.

Invasion of Yugoslavia



The Invasion of Yugoslavia (code-name Directive 25 or Operation 25 ), also known as the April
War ( Croatian : Travanjski rat , Serbian / Bosnian : Aprilski rat , Slovene : aprilska vojna ),
was the Axis Powers ' attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia which began on 6 April 1941 during
World War II . The invasion ended with the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army
on 17 April 1941, annexation and occupation of the region by the Axis powers and the creation of
the Independent State of Croatia ( Nezavisna DrÅŸava Hrvatska , or NDH).

Battle of Greece

Edit



The Battle of Greece (also known as Operation Marita , German : Unternehmen Marita ) [11 ] is the
common name for the invasion and conquest of Greece by Nazi Germany in April 1941. Greece was
supported by British Commonwealth forces, while the Germans' Axis allies Italy and Bulgaria
played secondary roles. The Battle of Greece is usually distinguished from the
Greco-Italian War fought in northwestern Greece and southern Albania from October 1940, as
well as from the Battle of Crete fought in late May. These operations, along with the Invasion
of Yugoslavia , comprise the Balkans Campaign of World War II .

The Balkans Campaign began with the Italian invasion of Greece on 28 October 1940. Within
weeks, the Italians were driven out of Greece and Greek forces pushed on to occupy much of
southern Albania. In March 1941, a major Italian counterattack failed, and Germany was
forced to come to the aid of its ally. Operation Marita began on 6 April 1941, with German troops
invading Greece through Bulgaria in an effort to secure its southern flank. The combined
Greek and British Commonwealth forces fought back with great tenacity, but were vastly
outnumbered and out-gunned, and finally collapsed. Athens fell on 27 April, however the
British managed to evacuate about 50,000 troops. The Greek campaign ended in a quick and
complete German victory with the fall of Kalamata in the Peloponnese ; it was over within 24
days. The conquest of Greece was completed through the capture of Crete a month later. Greece
remained under occupation by the Axis powers until October 1944.

Some historians regard the German campaign in Greece as decisive in determining the course of
World War II, maintaining that it fatally delayed the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union .
Others hold that the campaign had no influence on the launching of Operation Barbarossa as
monsoon conditions in the Ukraine would have postponed Axis operations regardless. Others
believed British intervention in Greece as a hopeless undertaking, a "political and
sentimental decision" or even a "definite strategic blunder." It has also been suggested the
British strategy was to create a barrier in Greece, to protect Turkey , the only (neutral)
country standing between an Axis block in the Balkans and the oil-rich Middle East .

Battle of Crete

Edit



The Battle of Crete ( German : Luftlandeschlacht um Kreta ; Greek : ÎœÎ¬Ï‡Î·
Ï„Î·Ï‚ ÎšÏ�Î®Ï„Î·Ï‚) was a battle during World War II on the Greek
island of Crete . It began on the morning of 20 May 1941, when Nazi Germany launched an airborne
invasion of Crete under the code-name Unternehmen Merkur ("Operation Mercury "). Greek and
Allied forces , along with Cretan civilians, defended the island.

After one day of fighting, the Germans had suffered very heavy casualties and none of their
objectives had been achieved. The next day, through miscommunication and the failure of
Allied commanders to grasp the situation, Maleme airfield in western Crete fell to the
Germans, enabling them to fly in reinforcements and overwhelm the defenders. The battle
lasted about 10 days.

The Battle of Crete was unprecedented in three respects: it was not only the first battle where
the FallschirmjÃ€ger ("parachute rangers") were used on a massive scale, but also the
first mainly airborne invasion in military history; the first time the Allies made
significant use of intelligence from the deciphered German Enigma code; and the first time
invading German troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population. Because of
the heavy casualties suffered by the paratroopers , Adolf Hitler forbade further large scale
airborne operations. However, the Allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers
and started to build their own airborne divisions.

Operation Barbossa

data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



Operation Barbarossa (named for Frederick Barbarossa , the medieval German ruler) was the
code name for Germany 's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II that began on 22 June
1941. Over 4.5 million troops of the Axis powers invaded the USSR along a 2,900 km (1,800 mi)
front. In addition to the large number of troops, it also involved 600,000 motor vehicles and
750,000 horses. Planning for Operation Barbarossa started on 18 December 1940; the secret
preparations and the military operation itself lasted almost a year, from spring to winter
1941. The Red Army repelled the Wehrmacht 's strongest blow, and Adolf Hitler did not achieve
the expected victory, but the Soviet Union's situation remained dire. Tactically, the
Germans had won some resounding victories and occupied some of the most important economic
areas of the country, mainly in Ukraine . Despite these successes, the Germans were pushed
back from Moscow and could never mount an offensive simultaneously along the entire
strategic Soviet-German front again.

Operation Barbarossa's failure led to Hitler's demands for further operations inside the
USSR, all of which eventually failed, such as continuing the Siege of Leningrad , Operation
Nordlicht , and Battle of Stalingrad , among other battles on the occupied Soviet territory.

Operation Barbarossa was the largest military operation in human history in both manpower
and casualties. Its failure was a turning point in the Third Reich 's fortunes. Most
important, Operation Barbarossa opened up the Eastern Front , to which more forces were
committed than in any other theatre of war in world history. Operation Barbarossa and the
areas that fell under it became the site of some of the largest battles, deadliest atrocities,
highest casualties, and most horrific conditions for Soviets and Germans alike â€” all
of which influenced the course of both World War II and 20th century history. The German forces
captured 3 million Russian POWs, who did not enjoy the protection stipulated in the Geneva
Conventions . Some 2/3 of them never returned alive

At 03:15 on Sunday, 22 June 1941, the Axis bombed major cities in Soviet-occupied Poland. It is
hard to pinpoint the opposing sides' strength in this initial phase, as most German figures
include reserves allocated to the East but not yet committed, as well as several other
comparability issues between the German and USSR's

figures. Roughly three million Wehrmacht troops went into action on 22 June, and they faced
slightly fewer Soviet troops in the border Military Districts . The contribution of the
German allies would generally not make itself felt until later. The surprise was complete:
though the Stavka , alarmed by reports that Wehrmacht units were approaching the border, had
at 00:30 ordered that the border troops be warned that war was imminent, only a small number of
units were alerted in time.

Aside from the roughly 3.2 million German ground troops engaged in, or earmarked for the
Eastern Campaign, about 500,000 Romanian, Hungarian, Slovakian, Croatian, and Italian
troops accompanied the German forces, while the Army of Finland made a major contribution in
the north. The 250th Spanish "Blue" Infantry Division was a formation of volunteered Spanish
Falangists and Nazi sympathisers.

Luftwaffe reconnaissance units worked frantically to plot troop concentration, supply
dumps, and airfields, and mark them for destruction. The Luftwaffe ' s task was to neutralize
the Soviet Air Force . This was not achieved in the first days of operations, despite the
Soviets having concentrated aircraft in huge groups on the permanent airfields rather than
dispersing them on field landing strips, making them ideal targets. The Luftwaffe claimed to
have destroyed 1,489 aircraft on the first day of operations. Hermann GÃ¶ring â€”
Chief of the Luftwaffe â€” distrusted the reports and ordered the figure checked.
Picking through the wreckages of Soviet airfields, the Luftwaffe ' s figures proved
conservative, as over 2,000 destroyed Soviet aircraft were found. The Luftwaffe lost 35
aircraft on the first day of combat. The Germans claimed to have destroyed only 3,100 Soviet
aircraft in the first three days. In fact Soviet losses were far higher: some 3,922 Soviet
machines had been lost (according to Russian Historian Viktor Kulikov). The Luftwaffe had
achieved air superiority over all three sectors of the front, and would maintain it until the
close of the year. The Luftwaffe could now devote large numbers of its Geschwader (see
Luftwaffe Organization ) to support the ground forces.

Army Group North

Opposite Army Group North were two Soviet armies. The Wehrmacht OKH thrust the 4th Panzer
Group, with a strength of 600 tanks, at the junction of the two Soviet armies in that sector. The
4th Panzer Group's objective was to cross the Neman and Daugava Rivers which were the two
largest obstacles in the advance to Leningrad . On the first day, the tanks crossed the River
Neman and penetrated 50 mi (80 km). Near Raseiniai , the armoured

Added by Revan S. Smith units were counter attacked by 300 tanks of the 3rd and 12th Soviet
Mechanized Corps. It took four days for the Germans to encircle and destroy the Soviet armour
who lacked fuel, ammunition and coordination. By the end of the first week the Soviet
Mechanized Corps had lost 90% of its strength. The Panzer Groups then crossed the Daugava near
Daugavpils . The Germans were now within striking distance of Leningrad. However, due to
their deteriorated supply situation, Hitler ordered the Panzer Groups to hold their
position while the infantry formations caught up. The orders to hold would last over a week,
giving time for the Soviets to build up a defence around Leningrad and along the bank of the Luga
River . Further complicating the Soviet position, on 22 June the anti-Soviet June Uprising in
Lithuania began, and on the next day an independent Lithuania was proclaimed. An estimated
30,000 Lithuanian rebels engaged Soviet forces, joined by ethnic Lithuanians from the Red
Army. As the Germans reached further north, armed resistance against the Soviets broke out in
Estonia as well. The " Battle of Estonia " ended on 7 August, when the 18th Army reached the Gulf
of Finland coast.

Army Group Centre

Edit

Opposite Army Group Centre were four Soviet armies: the 3rd , 4th , 10th and 11th Armies . The
Soviet Armies occupied a salient that jutted into German occupied Polish territory with the
Soviet salient's center at BiaÅ‚ystok . Beyond BiaÅ‚ystok was Minsk , both the capital
of Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and a key railway junction . AG Centre's two Panzer
Groups' goal was to meet at Minsk, denying the Red Army an escape route from the salient. The 3rd
Panzer Group broke through the junction of two Soviet Fronts in the north of the salient, and
crossed the River Neman while the 2nd Panzer Group crossed the Bug River river in the South.
While the Panzer Groups attacked, the Wehrmacht Army Group Centre infantry Armies struck at

Moscow at first failed to grasp the dimensions of the catastrophe that had befallen the USSR.
Marshall Timoshenko ordered all Soviet forces to launch a general counter-offensive, but
with supply and ammunition dumps destroyed, and a complete collapse of communication, the
uncoordinated attacks failed. Zhukov signed the infamous Directive of People's
Commissariat of Defence No. 3 (he later claimed under pressure from Stalin), which ordered
the Red Army to start an offensive. He commanded the troops â€œto encircle and destroy the
enemy grouping near SuwaÅ‚ki and to seize the SuwaÅ‚ki region by the evening of 26 June"
and â€œto encircle and destroy the enemy grouping invading in Vladimir-Volynia and
Brody directionâ€� and even â€œto seize the Lublin region by the evening of
24.6â€�This maneuver failed and disorganized Red Army units were soon destroyed by the
Wehrmacht forces.

On 27 June, 2 and 3 Panzer Groups met up at Minsk, advancing 200 mi (320 km) into Soviet territory
and a third of the way to Moscow. In the vast pocket between Minsk and the Polish border, the
remnants of 32 Soviet Rifle, eight tank, and motorized, cavalry and artillery divisions were
encircled.

the junctions of these armies while the 1st Panzer Group drove its armored spearhead of 600
tanks right through the Soviet 6th Army, aiming to take Brody . On 26 June, five Soviet
mechanized corps with over 1,000 tanks mounted a massive counter-attack on the 1st Panzer
Group. The battle was among the fiercest of the invasion, lasting over four days; in the end the
Germans prevailed, though the Soviets inflicted heavy losses on the 1st Panzer Group.



With the Soviet counter-offensives' failure, the last substantial Soviet tank forces in
Western Ukraine had been committed, and the Red Army assumed a defensive posture, focusing on
a strategic withdrawal under severe pressure. The Soviet air arm, the VVS, lost 1,561
aircraft over Kiev. The battle was a huge tactical (Hitler thought strategic) victory, but it
had drawn the German forces away from an early offensive against Moscow, and had delayed
further German progress by 11 weeks. General Kurt Von Tippleskirch noted, "The Russians had
indeed lost a battle, but they won the campaign".

Summary of the First Phase

data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D
Edit



By the end of the first week, all three German Army Groups had achieved major campaign
objectives. However, in the vast pocket around Minsk and BiaÅ‚ystok, the Soviets were
still fighting; reducing the pocket was causing high German casualties and many Red Army
troops were escaping. The usual estimated casualties of the Red Army amount to 600,000
killed, missing, captured or wounded.

Phase 2: Battle for Smolensk (3 July 1941â€“5 August 1941)

Edit

On 3 July, Hitler finally gave the go-ahead for the Panzers to resume their drive east after the
infantry divisions had caught up. However, a rainstorm typical of Russian summers slowed
their progress and Russian defenses stiffened. The delays gave the Soviets time to organize a
massive counterattack against Army Group Center. Army Group Center's ultimate objective
was Smolensk , which commanded the road to Moscow. Facing the Germans was an old Soviet
defensive line held by six armies. On 6 July, the Soviets attacked the 3rd Panzer Army with 700
tanks. The Germans defeated this counterattack with overwhelming air superiority. The 2nd
Panzer Army crossed the River Dnieper and closed on Smolensk from the south while the 3rd
Panzer Army, after defeating the Soviet counter attack, closed on Smolensk from the north.

Added by Revan S. Smith three Soviet armies. On 18 July, the Panzer Groups came to within 10
miles of closing the gap but the trap would not snap shut until 26 July. When the Panzer Groups
finally closed the gap, 180,000 Red Army troops were captured but liquidating the pocket took
another 10 days in which time 100,000 Soviet troops escaped to stand between the Germans and
Moscow.

Four weeks into the campaign, the Germans realized they had grossly underestimated Soviet
strength. The German troops had used their initial supplies without attaining the expected
strategic freedom of movement. Operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply; the
delay was to be used to adapt strategy to the new situation. Hitler had lost faith in
encirclement as large numbers of Soviet soldiers had escaped the pincers. Hitler now
believed he could defeat the Soviets by economic damage, depriving them of the industrial
capacity to continue the war. That meant seizing the industrial center of Kharkov , the Donets
Basin and the oil fields of the Caucasus in the south and a speedy capture of Leningrad, a major
center of military production, in the north. He also wanted to link up with the Finns to the
north.

Fedor von Bock and almost all the German generals involved in Operation Barbarossa,
vehemently argued in favor of continuing the all-out drive toward Moscow. Besides the
psychological importance of capturing the enemy's capital, the generals pointed out that
Moscow was a major center of arms production and the center of the Soviet communications and
transportation system. More importantly, intelligence reports indicated that the bulk of
the Red Army was deployed near Moscow under Semyon Timoshenko for an all-out defense of the
capital. But Hitler was adamant, and issued a direct order to Guderian , bypassing his
commanding officer Bock , to send Army Group Centre's tanks to the north and south,
temporarily halting the drive to Moscow.

Phase 3: Kiev and Leningrad (5 August 1941â€“2 October 1941)

By mid-July below the Pinsk Marshes , the Germans had come within a few kilometers of Kiev . The
1st Panzer Army then went south while the German 17th Army struck east and in between the
Germans trapped three Soviet armies near Uman. As the Germans eliminated the pocket, the
tanks turned north and crossed the Dnieper. Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Army, diverted from
Army Group Centre, had crossed the River Desna with 2nd Army on its right flank. The two Panzer
armies now trapped four Soviet armies and parts of two others. For its final attack on
Leningrad, the 4th Panzer Army was reinforced by tanks from Army Group Centre. On 8 August, the
Panzers broke through the Soviet defenses; the German 16th Army attacked to the northeast,
the 18th Army and the Estonian guerilla Forest Brothers cleared the country and advanced to
Lake Peipus . By the

Added by Revan S. Smith end of August, 4th Panzer Army had penetrated to within 30 mi (48 km) of
Leningrad. The Finns had pushed southeast on both sides of Lake Ladoga , reaching the old
Finnish-Soviet frontier.

At this stage, Hitler ordered the final destruction of Leningrad with no prisoners taken, and
on 9 September, Army Group North began the final push which within ten days brought it within 7
mi (11 km) of the city. However, the advance over the last 10 km (6.2 mi) proved very slow and
casualties mounted. At this stage, Hitler lost patience and ordered that Leningrad should
not be stormed but starved into submission. Deprived of its Panzer forces, Army Group Center
had remained static and was subjected to numerous Soviet counter-attacks in particular the
Yelnya Offensive in which the Germans suffered their first major tactical defeat since their
invasion began. These attacks drew Hitler's attention back to Army Group Center and its drive
on Moscow. The Germans ordered the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies to break off their siege of
Leningrad and support Army Group Center on its attack on Moscow.

Before the attack on Moscow could begin, operations in Kiev needed to be finished. Half of Army
Group Centre had swung to the south in the back of the Kiev position, while Army Group South
moved to the north from its Dniepr bridgehead. The encirclement of Soviet Forces in Kiev was
achieved on 16 September. A savage battle ensued in which the Soviets were hammered with
tanks, artillery, and aerial bombardment. In the end, after ten days of vicious fighting, the
Germans claimed over 600,000 Soviet soldiers captured. Actual losses were 452,720 men,
3,867 artillery guns and mortars from 43 Divisions of the 5th, 37th, 26th and 21st Soviet
Armies.

Phase 4: Operation Typhoon (2 October 1941â€“5 December 1941)

After Kiev, the Red Army no longer outnumbered the Germans and there were no more directly
available trained reserves. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83
divisions, but no more than 25 divisions were fully effective. Operation Typhoon , the drive
to Moscow, began on 2 October. In front of Army Group Centre was a series of elaborate defense
lines, the first centered on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk .

The first blow took the Soviets completely by surprise as 2nd Panzer Army returning from the
south took Oryol which was 75 mi (121 km) south of the Soviet first main defense line. Three days
later the Panzers pushed on Bryansk while 2nd Army attacked from the west. The Soviet 3rd and
13th armies were now encircled. To the north, the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies attacked Vyazma ,
trapping the 19th, 20th, 24th and 32nd Soviet Armies.

Added by Revan S. Smith Moscow's first line of defence had been shattered. The pocket yielded
673,000 Soviet prisoners, bringing the tally since the start of the invasion to three million
Soviet soldiers captured. The Soviets had only 90,000 men and 150 tanks left for the defense of
Moscow.

On 13 October, 3rd Panzer Army penetrated to within 90 mi (140 km) of the capital. Martial law
was declared in Moscow. Almost from the beginning of Operation Typhoon the weather had
deteriorated. Temperatures fell while there was a continued rainfall, turning the unpaved
road network into mud and steadily slowing the German advance on Moscow to as little as 2 mi (3.2
km) a day. The supply situation rapidly deteriorated. On 31 October, the German Army High
Command ordered a halt to Operation Typhoon while the armies were re-organized. The pause
gave the Soviets, who were in a far better supply situation, time to consolidate their
positions and organize formations of newly activated reservists. In little over a month the
Soviets organized eleven new armies which included 30 divisions of Siberian troops. These
had been freed from the Soviet far east as Soviet intelligence had assured Stalin there was no
longer a threat from the Japanese. With the Siberian forces came over 1,000 tanks and 1,000
aircraft.

The Germans were nearing exhaustion, they also began to recall Napoleon's invasion of Russia
. General GÃŒnther Blumentritt noted in his diary:

They remembered what happened to Napoleon's Army. Most of them began to re-read
Caulaincourt's grim account of 1812. That had a weighty influence at this critical time in
1941. I can still see Von Kluge trudging through the mud from his sleeping quarters to his
office and standing before the map with Caulaincourt's book in his hand.



On 15 November, with the ground hardening due to the cold weather, the Germans once again began
the attack on Moscow. Although the troops themselves were now able to advance again, there had
been no delay allowed to improve the supply situation. Facing the Germans were the 5th, 16th,
30th, 43rd, 49th, and 50th Soviet armies. The Germans intended to let 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies
cross the Moscow Canal and envelop Moscow from the northeast. 2nd Panzer Army would attack
Tula and then close in on Moscow from the south. As the Soviets reacted to the flanks, 4th Army
would attack the center. In two weeks of desperate fighting, lacking sufficient fuel and
ammunition, the Germans slowly crept towards Moscow. However, in the south, 2nd Panzer Army
was being blocked. On 22 November, Soviet Siberian units augmented with the 49th and 50th
Soviet Armies attacked the 2nd Panzer Army and inflicted a shocking defeat on the Germans.
However, 4th Panzer Army pushed the Soviet 16th Army back and succeeded in crossing the Moscow
canal and began the encirclement.

On 2 December, part of the 258th Infantry Division advanced to within 15 mi (24 km) of Moscow,
and could see the spires of the Kremlin , but by then the first blizzards of the winter began. A
Reconnaissance-Battalion also managed to reach the town of Khimki â€”some 8 km (5.0 mi)
away from Moscowâ€”and captured its bridge over the Moscow-Volga Canal as well as its
railway station, which marked the farthest advance of German forces on Moscow. [93 ] [94 ] The
Wehrmacht was not equipped for winter warfare. Frostbite and disease caused more casualties
than combat, and dead and wounded had already reached 155,000 in three weeks. Some divisions
were now at 50% strength. The bitter cold also caused severe problems for their guns and
equipment, and weather conditions grounded the Luftwaffe . Newly built-up Soviet units near
Moscow now numbered over 500,000 men, and on 5 December, they launched a massive
counterattack which pushed the Germans back over 200 mi (320 km). The invasion of the USSR
eventually cost the German Army over 250,000 dead and 500,000 wounded, the majority of whom
became casualties after 1 October and an unknown number of Axis casualties such as
Hungarians, Romanians and Waffen SS troops as well as co-belligerent Finns.

Battle of Moscow

Edit



The Battle of Moscow ( Russian : Ð‘ÐžÑ‚Ð²Ð° Ð¿ÐŸÐŽ
ÐœÐŸÑ�ÐºÐ²ÐŸÐ¹, Romanized : Bitva pod Moskvoy , German : Schlacht um Moskau
) is the name given by Soviet historians to two periods of strategically significant fighting
on a 600 km (370 mi) sector of the Eastern Front during World War II . It took place between
October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defensive effort frustrated Hitler 's attack on
Moscow, capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the largest Soviet
city. Moscow was one of the primary military and political objectives for Axis forces in their
invasion of the Soviet Union .

The German strategic offensive named Operation Typhoon was planned to conduct two pincer
offensives , one to the north of Moscow against the Kalinin Front by the 3rd and 4th Panzer
Groups, simultaneously severing the Moscow-Leningrad railway , and another to the south of
Moscow Oblast against the Western Front , south of Tula by the 2nd Panzer Army, while the 4th
Army advanced directly towards Moscow from the west. A separate operational German plan,
codenamed Operation Wotan , was included in the final phase of the German offensive.

Initially, the Soviet forces conducted a strategic defence of the Moscow Oblast by
constructing three defensive belts , and deploying newly raised reserve armies as well as
bringing troops from the Siberian and Far Eastern Military Districts . Subsequently, as the
German offensives were halted, a Soviet strategic counter-offensive and smaller-scale
offensive operations were executed to force German armies back to the positions around the
cities of Oryol , Vyazma and Vitebsk , nearly surrounding three German armies in the process.

Battle of Gondar



The Battle of Gondar was the last stand of the Italian forces in Italian East Africa during the
Second World War . The battle took place in November 1941, during the East African Campaign .
The Italian garrison of 40,000 was commanded by Generale Guglielmo Nasi .

Kulkaber

Edit



On 13 November, a mixed force from the British 12th (African) Division under Major-General
Charles Fowkes â€”supported by Ethiopian patriotsâ€”attacked the key
defensive position of Kulkaber and were repelled. However, a renewed attack a week later on
Kulkaber was successful.

Mountain passes captured

There were two mountain passes that overlooked the town which were controlled by the Italian
troops. They were invested by the two brigades of the British 12th (African) Division and the
two Italian groups in the passes were cut off and were forced to surrender when their supplies
ran out.

Gondar town surrenders

Once the Allied troops had taken the passes, they gained control of the heights overlooking
the town, and the Italian garrison under Generale Nasi in the town itself was attacked on 27
November and surrendered after the Kenya Armoured Car Regiment had penetrated the
outerskirts of the town.

Attack on Pearl Harbor

Edit



The attack on Pearl Harbor (called Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial
General Headquarters ( Operation Z in planning) and the Battle of Pearl Harbor ) was a surprise
military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base
at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii, on the morning of December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan). The attack
was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering
with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas
territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States.

The base was attacked by 353 Japanese fighters, bombers and torpedo planes in two waves,
launched from six aircraft carriers . Four U.S. Navy battleships were sunk (two of which were
raised and returned to service later in the war) and the four others present were damaged. The
Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training
ship, and one minelayer . 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,402 men were killed and 1,282
wounded. The power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage
facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the
intelligence section ) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five
midget submarines lost, and 65 servicemen killed or wounded. One Japanese sailor was
captured.

The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American
entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters . The following day (December
8) the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for isolationism , which had been
strong, disappeared. Clandestine support of Britain (for example the Neutrality Patrol )
was replaced by active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and
Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day.

Despite numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, the lack
of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led
President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, "a date which will live in
infamy" .

Second Battle of Changsha







The battle started when a small Chinese guerrilla force clashed with the Japanese 6th
Division in the mountains southeast of Yueyang on 6 September. On the 17th, the Japanese
crossed the Sinchiang River (æ–°å¢™æ²³) at four points and made rapid advances,
crossing the Milo River on 19 September. The main Chinese force avoided confronting the enemy
but marched in a parallel fashion, out-flanking the Japanese trail southward. The Japanese
also attempted to out-flank and encircle the Chinese. This caused both the Chinese and the
Japanese armies to reach the Laotao River (æ�žåˆ€æ²³) regions for an inevitable
battle.

On 27 September, several hundred Japanese troops in plain clothes reached the north gate of
Changsha but were unable to sabotage the city defenses, leading to heavy fighting on the 28th.
Unable to overcome the defenders, the Japanese began a general retreat back to the Yueyang
region on 30 September.

23rd and the 38th Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant General Takashi Sakai , but were
outnumbered nearly four to one (Japanese, 52,000; Allied, 14,000) and lacked their
opponents' recent combat experience.

The colony had no significant air defence. The RAF Station at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport had
only five airplanes: two Supermarine Walrus amphibians and three Vickers Vildebeest
torpedo-reconnaissance bombers, flown and serviced by seven officers and 108 airmen. An
earlier request for a fighter squadron had been rejected, and the nearest fully operational
RAF base was in Kota Bharu , Malaya , nearly 2,250 kilometres away.

Hong Kong also lacked adequate naval defence. Three destroyers were to withdraw to Singapore
.

The Japanese bombed Kai Tak Airport on 8 December. Two of the three Vildebeest and the two
Walrus were destroyed by 12 Japanese bombers. The attack also destroyed several civil
aircraft including all but two of the aircraft used by the Air Unit of the Hong Kong Volunteer
Defence Corp. The RAF and Air Unit personnel from then on fought as ground troops. Two of the
Royal Navy's three remaining destroyers were ordered to leave Hong Kong for Singapore . Only
one destroyer, HMS Thracian, several gunboats and a flotilla of motor torpedo boats
remained.

The Commonwealth forces decided against holding the Sham Chun River and instead established
three battalions in the Gin Drinkers' Line across the hills. The Japanese 38th Infantry under
the command of Major General Takaishi Sakai quickly forded the Sham Chun River by using
temporary bridges. Early on 10 December 1941 the 228th Infantry Regiment, commanded by
Colonel Teihichi, of the 38th Division attacked the Commonwealth defences at the Shing Mun
Redoubt defended by 2nd Battalion Royal Scots, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel S. White. The
line is breached in five hours and later that day the Royal Scots also withdraw from Golden
Hill. D company of the Royal Scots counter-attacks and captures Golden Hill. By 10:00am the

withdrawal. By 13 December, the 5/7 Rajputs of the British Indian Army commanded by
Lieutenant Colonel R. Cadosan-Rowlinson, the last Commonwealth troops on the mainland, had
retreated to Hong Kong Island .

Maltby organised the defence of the island, splitting it between an East Brigade and a West
Brigade. On 15 December, the Japanese began systematic bombardment of the island's North
Shore. Two demands for surrender were made on 13 December and 17 December. When these were
rejected, Japanese forces crossed the harbour on the evening of 18 December and landed on the
island's North-East. They suffered only light casualties, although no effective command
could be maintained until the dawn came. That night, approximately 20 gunners were massacred
at the Sai Wan Battery after they had surrendered. There was a further massacre of prisoners,
this time of medical staff, in the Salesian Mission on Chai Wan Road. In both cases, a few men
survived to tell the story.

On the morning of 19 December, a Canadian Company Sergeant Major , John Robert Osborn of the
Winnipeg Grenadiers, threw himself on top of a grenade, sacrificing himself to save the lives
of the men around him; he was later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross . Fierce fighting
continued on Hong Kong Island but the Japanese annihilated the headquarters of West Brigade,
causing the death of Brigadier John K. Lawson , the commander of the West Brigade . A British
counter-attack could not force them from the Wong Nai Chung Gap that secured the passage
between downtown and the secluded southern parts of the island. From 20 December, the island
became split in two with the British Commonwealth forces still holding out around the Stanley
peninsula and in the West of the island. At the same time, water supplies started to run short as
the Japanese captured the island's reservoirs.

On the morning of 25 December, Japanese soldiers entered the British field hospital at St.
Stephen's College , and tortured and killed a large number of injured soldiers , along with the
medical staff.

By the afternoon of 25 December 1941, it was clear that further resistance would be futile and
British colonial officials headed by the Governor of Hong Kong , Sir Mark Aitchison Young ,
surrendered in person at the Japanese headquarters on the third floor of the Peninsula Hong
Kong hotel . This was the first occasion on which a British Crown Colony has surrendered to an
invading force. [ citation needed ] The garrison had held out for 17 days. This day is known in
Hong Kong as "Black Christmas ".

The First Battle of Guam , was an engagement during the Pacific War in World War II , and took
place on 8 December 1941 on Guam in the Mariana Islands between the Empire of Japan and the
United States . The American garrison was defeated by Japanese forces which resulted in an
occupation until the Second Battle of Guam in 1944.

Japanese plans for the Pacific War included capturing Guam within the war's first days. From
March 1941 Japanese aircraft flew photo reconnaissance sorties over the island. Plans for
the invasion of the island were completed in September that year, and the South Seas
Detachment was selected as the main unit responsible for this. The South Seas Detachment
comprised the 144th Infantry Regiment and other units detached from the 55th Division and had
a strength of 4,886 men. The South Seas Detachment was concentrated in Korea during November
1941 and, following a brief stay in Japan, sailed for Chichi-jima in the Bonin Islands late
that month. The 370-man strong 5th Company of the 2nd Maizuru Special Naval Landing Force ,

units would be transported to Guam by nine transports escorted by the minelayer Tsugaru and
four destroyers . The 6th Cruiser Division, which comprised four heavy cruisers , was also
available to provide support if needed. The landing force and naval units were supported by
the 18th Naval Air Corps, which was based at Saipan and equipped with obsolete floatplanes.

The United States Government did not believe that it would be possible or practical to defend
Guam if it was attacked. The island was not seen as being useful in efforts to reinforce the
Philippines , though it served as a refueling point for Pan Am flying boats and was one of the
relay points for the Pacific Cable Company's telegraph cable which linked the Philippines to
the US west coast. In 1941 the island was given a "Category F" defense rating; this ruled out the
construction of new defenses and meant that when war broke out Guam's defenders would destroy
all facilities of military value and withdraw.

Despite the low priority accorded to Guam, some minor steps were taken to improve its defenses
before war broke out. A contract for minor improvements to the military facilities on Guam was
issued in April 1941, and work began the next month. The Guam Insular Force Guard , which was a
locally-manned milita force responsible for protecting the naval base, was also slightly
expanded in May. On 17 October the dependents of the American military personnel on the island
were evacuated to the United States by the transport USS Henderson , followed by more than 1000
construction workers. On 23 October 1941 the US Navy's General Board provided Secretary of
the Navy Frank Knox with a report on Guam's defenses which recommended against reinforcing
the island due to the difficulties of defending it and the need to allocate resources to other
priorities. The report argued in favor of continuing to improve Guam's harbour and seaplane
facilities, however.

At the outbreak of war on 8 December 1941 (local time), Guam was defended by small US Navy and
USMC units as well as the Insular Force Guard. Captain George McMillin , who was also the
island's governor and the overall commander of the garrison, was in charge of Naval Forces,
Guam which comprised 271 personnel and four nurses. This force was a subordinate unit of the
Asiatic Fleet and most of its personnel were unarmed. Guam's guard ship, the USS Gold Star had
sailed to the Philippines to pick up supplies and enable the crew to buy Christmas presents and
was directed to remain there. The minesweeper USS Penguin was present at the island, however,
along with the immobile oil depot ship Robert L. Barnes . Marine Barracks, Sumay had a strength
of 145 men who were organised into a company armed with rifles and a small number of machine
guns. The Insular Force Guard comprised 246 men, most of whom had received little training.
The marines and Insular Force Guard were equipped with 170 M1903 Springfield rifles, 13 Lewis
Guns and 15 Browning Automatic Rifles . The defenders did not have any mortars or artillery
other than the guns on board Penguin . In addition to these military units, Guam's police force
(the Guam Insular Patrol ) had a strength of 80 men who were armed only with pistols .

Barracks, the Piti Navy Yard, Libugon radio station, Standard Oil Company, and the Pan
American Hotel. During the air attack, the minesweeper USS Penguin , the largest navy vessel
at the island, was sunk. One officer was killed and several men wounded. The air raids all over
Guam continued into the morning and afternoon before subsiding at 17:00.

The next day at 08:30, Japanese air attacks resumed, with no more than nine aircraft attacking
at a time. The same targets as the previous day were attacked, and also the Government House in
Agana and several villages. That evening, a Japanese invasion fleet of four heavy cruisers ,
four destroyers , two gunboats , and six submarine chasers , two minesweepers, and two tenders
left Saipan for Guam.

Saipan on Guam on 10 December 1941 at Dungcas Beach, north of Agana. They attacked and quickly
defeated the Insular Force Guard in Agana. They then advanced on Piti, moving toward Sumay and
the Marine Barracks. The principal engagement took place on Agana's Plaza de Espana at 04:45
when a few Marines and Insular Force Guardsmen fought with the Japanese naval soldiers. After
token resistance, the Marines surrendered at 05:45. Governor McMillin officially
surrendered at 06:00. A few skirmishes took place all over the island before news of the
surrender spread and the rest of the island forces laid down their arms. The American patrol
boat YP-16 was scuttled by means of fire during the event and YP-17 was captured by Japanese
naval forces. An American freighter was damaged by the Japanese.

In the meantime the Japanese South Seas Detached Force (about 5,500 men) under the command of
Major-General Tomitaro Horii made separate landings at Tumon Bay in the north, on the
southwest coast near Merizo, and on the eastern shore of the island at Talafofo Bay.

U.S. Marine losses were 5 killed and 13 wounded. The U.S. Navy lost 8 killed, The Guam Insular
Force Guards lost 4 killed and 22 wounded. One Japanese naval soldier was killed and 6 wounded.

December 1941, with the surrender of the American forces to the Empire of Japan . It was fought
on and around the atoll formed by Wake Island and its islets of Peale and Wilkes Islands by the
air, land and naval forces of the Empire of Japan against those of the U.S., with Marines
playing a prominent role on both sides.

On 8 December, just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor (Wake being on the opposite side of
the International Date Line ), 36 Japanese Mitsubishi G3M 3 bombers flown from bases on the
Marshall Islands attacked Wake Island, destroying 8 of the 12 F4F-3 Wildcat fighter aircraft
belonging to Marine Corps fighter squadron VMF-211 on the ground. The remaining four
wildcats were in the air patrolling, but because of poor visibility failed to see the
attacking Japanese bombers. These Wildcats did down two bombers on the following day,
however. All of the Marine garrisonâ€™s defensive emplacements were left intact by the
raid, which primarily targeted the naval aircraft. Of 55 Marine aviation personnel, 23 were
killed and 11 were wounded. Ten Chamorro civilian employees of Pan American Airways were also
killed.

First Landing Attempt

Early on the morning of 11 December, the garrison, with the support of the four remaining
Wildcats, repelled the first Japanese landing attempt by the South Seas Force , which
included the light cruisers Yubari , TenryÅ« , and Tatsuta ; the destroyers Yayoi , Mutsuki ,
Kisaragi , Hayate , Oite , and Asanagi ; two Momi -class destroyers converted to patrol boats (
Patrol Boat No. 32 and Patrol Boat No. 33 ), and two troop transport ships containing 450
Special Naval Landing Force troops.

The U.S. Marines fired at the invasion fleet with their six 5 in (130 mm) coastal artillery
guns. Major Devereux, the Marine commander under Cunningham, ordered the gunners to hold
their fire until the enemy moved within range of the coastal defenses. "Battery L", on Peale
islet, succeeded in sinking Hayate at a distance of 4,000 yd (3,700 m) with at least two direct
hits to her magazines, causing her to explode and sink within two minutes, in full view of the
defenders on shore. Yubari ' s superstructure was hit 11 times. The four Wildcats also
succeeded in sinking another destroyer, Kisaragi , by dropping a bomb on her stern where the
depth charges were stored. Both Japanese destroyers were lost with all hands, with Hayate
becoming the first Japanese surface warship to be sunk during World War II. The Japanese force
withdrew before landing. This was the first Japanese defeat of the war.

After the initial raid was fought off, American news media reported that, when queried about
reinforcement and resupply, Cunningham was reported to have quipped â€œSend us more
Japs!â€� In fact, Commander Cunningham sent a long list of critical
equipmentâ€”including gunsights, spare parts, and fire-control radar â€”to
his immediate superior: Commandant, 14th Naval District. It is believed that the quip was
actually padding (a technique of adding nonsense text to a message to make cryptanalysis more
difficult).

But the continuing siege and frequent Japanese air attacks on the Wake garrison continued,
without resupply for the Americans. The initial resistance offered by the garrison prompted
the Japanese Navy to detach two aircraft carriers ( SÅ�ryÅ« and HiryÅ« ) from the force
that attacked Pearl Harbor to support the second landing attempt.

USN Relief Attempt

Edit



The projected U.S. relief attempt by Admiral Frank Fletcher 's Task Force 11 (TF 11) and
supported Admiral Wilson Brownâ€™s TF 14 consisted of the fleet carrier Saratoga , the
fleet oiler Neches , the seaplane tender Tangier , the heavy cruisers Astoria , Minneapolis ,
and San Francisco , and 10 destroyers. The convoy carried the 4th Marine Defense Battalion,
the VMF-221 fighter squadron equipped with Brewster F2A-3 Buffalo fighters, along with
9,000 5 in (130 mm) rounds , 12,000 3 in (76 mm) rounds, and 3,000,000 .50 in (12.7 mm) rounds, as
well as a large amount of ammunition for mortars and other battalion small arms. TF
14â€”with the fleet carrier Lexington , three heavy cruisers, eight destroyers, and an
oilerâ€”was to undertake a raid on the Marshall Islands to divert Japanese attention.

At 21:00 on 22 December, after receiving information indicating the presence of two IJN
carriers and two fast battleships near Wake Island Vice Admiral William S. Pye â€”the
Acting Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet â€”ordered TF 14 to return to Pearl
Harbor for fear of losses.

Second Assault

Edit



The second Japanese invasion force came on 23 December, composed mostly of the same ships from
the first attempt with some new additions, plus 1,500 Japanese marines. The landings began at
02:35 where, after a preliminary bombardment, the ex-destroyers Patrol Boat No. 32 and
Patrol Boat No. 33 were beached and burned in their attempts to land the invasion force. After a
full night and morning of fighting, the Wake garrison surrendered to the Japanese by
mid-afternoon.

The U.S. Marines lost 47 killed and 2 MIA during the entire 15-day siege, while three U.S. Navy
personnel and at least 10 U.S. civilians were killed, 10 Chamorros civilians killed, and 12
civilians wounded. Japanese losses were recorded at between 700 to 900 killed, with at least
300 more wounded, in addition to the two destroyers lost in the first invasion attempt and at
least 28 land-based and carrier aircraft either shot down or damaged. The Japanese captured
all men remaining on the island, the majority of whom were civilian contractors employed with
Morrison-Knudsen Company.

Captain Henry T. Elrod , one of the pilots from VMF-211, was awarded the Medal of Honor
posthumously for his action on the island during the second landing attempt, having shot down
two Japanese A6M2 Zeros , and sunk the Japanese destroyer Kisaragi . A special military
decoration, the Wake Island Device , was created to honor those who had fought in the defense of
the island.

Malayan Campaign

Edit



The Malayan Campaign was a campaign fought by Allied and Japanese forces in Malaya , from 8
December 1941 â€“ 31 January 1942 during the Second World War . The campaign was
dominated by land battles between British Commonwealth army units, and the Imperial
Japanese Army . For the British, Indian, Australian and Malayan forces defending the colony,
the campaign was a total disaster.

The battle is notable for the Japanese use of bicycle infantry , which allowed troops to carry
more equipment and swiftly move through thick jungle terrain. Royal Engineers , equipped
with demolition charges, destroyed over a hundred bridges during the retreat, which did
little to delay the Japanese. By the time the Japanese had captured Singapore, they had
suffered 9,600 casualties.

Battle of Singapore

Edit



The Battle of Singapore was fought in the South-East Asian theatre of the Second World War when
the Empire of Japan invaded the Allied stronghold of Singapore . Singapore was the major
British military base in Southeast Asia and nicknamed the "Gibraltar of the East" . The
fighting in Singapore lasted from 8â€“15 February 1942.

It resulted in the fall of Singapore to the Japanese, and the largest surrender of British-led
military personnel in history. About 80,000 British , Australian and Indian troops became
prisoners of war , joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the Malayan Campaign . British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill called the ignominious fall of Singapore to the Japanese the
"worst disaster" and "largest capitulation" in British history. In just seven days,
Singapore, the "Impregnable Fortress", had fallen.
