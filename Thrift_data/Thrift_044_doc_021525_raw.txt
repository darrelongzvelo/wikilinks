Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos ; August 22, 1963) is an American pianist , singer-songwriter
and composer . She was at the forefront of a number of female singer-songwriters in the early
1990s and was noteworthy early in her career as one of the few alternative rock performers to
use a piano as her primary instrument. Some of her charting singles include " Crucify ", "
Silent All These Years ", " God ", " Cornflake Girl ", " Caught a Lite Sneeze ", " Professional
Widow ", " Spark ", " 1000 Oceans ", and " A Sorta Fairytale ", her most commercially successful
single in the U.S. to date. [2]

As of 2005, Amos had sold 12 million albums worldwide. [3] She has been nominated for 8 Grammy
Awards . Amos was also named one of People Magazine ' s 50 Most Beautiful People in 1996. [4]

[ edit ] Early life



Amos was born in Newton, North Carolina . When she was two, her family moved to Baltimore,
Maryland , where she began to play the piano. By age five, she had begun composing instrumental
pieces on piano and, while living in Rockville, Maryland , she won a full scholarship to the
Preparatory Division of the Peabody Conservatory of Music . [5] Her scholarship was
discontinued at age 11 and she was asked to leave. Amos has asserted that she lost the
scholarship because of her interest in rock and popular music, coupled with her dislike for
reading from sheet music. [5] In 1972, The Amos family moved to Silver Spring, Maryland , where
her father, Reverend Edison Amos, became pastor of the Good Shepherd United Methodist
church. At the age of 13 she began playing at gay bars and piano bars , chaperoned by her father.
[5] [6]

Amos first came to local notice by winning a county teen talent contest in 1977, singing a song
called "More Than Just a Friend". As a senior at Richard Montgomery High School , she co-wrote "
Baltimore " with her brother Mike Amos for a competition involving the Baltimore Orioles . The
song won the contest and became her first single, released as a 7" single pressed locally for
family and friends during 1980 with another Amos-penned composition as a B-side , "Walking
With You". Prior to this period she performed under her middle name, Ellen, but permanently
adopted Tori after a friend's boyfriend told her it suited her. [7] At age 21, Amos moved to Los
Angeles to pursue her music career after several years performing on the piano bar circuit of
the D.C. area. [8]

[ edit ] Atlantic years (1986–2001)



[ edit ] Y Kant Tori Read



In 1986, Amos formed a music group, Y Kant Tori Read , the name of which was a reference to her days
at the Peabody Conservatory, where she was able to play songs on her piano by ear, but was never
successful at sight reading . [9] In addition to Amos, the group was composed of Steve Caton
(who would later play guitars on all her subsequent albums until 1999), drummer Matt Sorum ,
bass player Brad Cobb and, for a short time, keyboardist Jim Tauber. Following several phases
of writing and recording, during which Amos has since asserted that the band lost their
musical edge and direction due to interference from record executives, in July 1988, the Y
Kant Tori Read 's self-titled debut album was released. Although its producer, Joe
Chiccarelli , has stated that Amos was very happy with the album at the time, [10] it is now out of
print and Amos has expressed no interest in reissuing it. [11] Following the album's
commercial failure and the group's subsequent disbanding, Amos began working with other
artists (including Stan Ridgway , Sandra Bernhard , and Al Stewart ) as a backup vocalist. She
also recorded a song called "Distant Storm" for the film China O'Brien ; in the credits, the
song is attributed to a band called Tess Makes Good. [12] It was the only song recorded by the
band, and its only commercial release was in the film.

[ edit ] Solo career



Despite the disappointing reaction to Y Kant Tori Read , Amos still had to comply with her
six-record contract with Atlantic Records, who in 1989 wanted a new record by March 1990. The
initial recordings were declined by the label, which Amos felt was because the album had not
been properly presented. [13] The album was reworked and expanded under the guidance of Doug
Morris and the musical talents of Steve Caton , Eric Rosse , Will MacGregor, Carlo Nuccio, and
Dan Nebenzal, resulting in Little Earthquakes , an album recounting her religious
upbringing, sexual awakening, struggle to establish her identity, and sexual assault. This
album became her commercial and artistic breakthrough.

Amos traveled to New Mexico with personal and professional partner Eric Rosse in 1993 to write
and largely record her second solo record, Under the Pink . The album was received with mostly
favorable reviews and sold enough copies to chart at #12 on the Billboard 200 , a significantly
higher position than the preceding album's position at #54 on the same chart. [14]

Her third solo album, Boys for Pele , was released in January 1996. The album was recorded in an
Irish church, in Delgany , County Wicklow , with Amos taking advantage of the church recording
setting to create an album ripe with baroque influences, lending it a darker sound and style.
She added harpsichord , harmonium , and clavichord to her keyboard repertoire, and also
included such anomalies as a gospel choir , bagpipes , church bells, and drum programming. The
album garnered mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising its intensity and
uniqueness while others bemoaned its comparative impenetrability. Despite the album's
erratic lyrical content and instrumentation, the latter of which kept it away from
mainstream audiences, Boys for Pele is Amos's most successful simultaneous transatlantic
release, reaching #2 on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Top 40 upon its release at the height of
her fame. [15] [16]

Fueled by the desire to have her own recording studio to distance herself from record company
executives, [17] Amos had the barn of her home in Cornwall converted into a state-of-the-art
recording studio, Martian Engineering Studios.

From the Choirgirl Hotel and To Venus and Back , released in May 1998 and September 1999,
respectively, differ greatly from previous albums as Amos's trademark acoustic
piano-based sound is largely replaced with arrangements that include elements of
electronica , dance music, vocal washes and sonic landscapes. The underlying themes of both
albums deal with womanhood, and Amos's own miscarriages and marriage. Reviews for From the
Choirgirl Hotel were mostly favorable and praised Amos's continued artistic originality.
While not her highest chart debut, debut sales for From the Choirgirl Hotel are Amos's best to
date, selling 153,000 copies in its first week. [18] To Venus and Back , a two-disc release of
original studio material and live material recorded from the previous world tour, received
mostly positive reviews and included the first major-label single available for sale as a
digital download. [19]

Motherhood inspired Amos to produce a cover album , recording songs written by men about women
and reversing the gender roles to show a woman's perspective. [20] That idea grew into Strange
Little Girls , released in September 2001, one year after giving birth to her daughter. The
album is Amos's first concept album , with artwork featuring Amos photographed in character
of the women portrayed in each song. Amos would later reveal that a stimulus for the album was to
end her contract with Atlantic without giving them new original songs; Amos felt that since
1998, the label had not been properly promoting her and had trapped her in a contract by
refusing to sell her to another label. [21]

[ edit ] Epic Records years (2002–07)



With her Atlantic contract fulfilled after a 15-year stint, Amos signed to Epic in late 2001.
In October 2002, Amos released Scarlet's Walk , another concept album. Described as a "sonic
novel ", the album explores Amos's alter ego , Scarlet, intertwined with her cross-country
concert tour following 9/11 . Through the songs, Amos explores such topics as the history of
America, American people, Native American history, pornography , masochism , homophobia
and misogyny . The album had a strong debut, [22] [23] demonstrating that Amos' fan base
remained intact through the label change. However, Scarlet's Walk is Amos' last album to date
to reach certified gold status. [24]

concert in June, 2005

Not long after Amos was ensconced with her new label, she received unsettling news when Polly
Anthony resigned as president of Epic Records in 2003. Anthony had been one of the primary
reasons Amos signed with the label and as a result of her resignation, Amos formed the Bridge
Entertainment Group. Further trouble for Amos occurred the following year when her label,
Epic/Sony Music Entertainment, merged with BMG Entertainment as a result of the industry's
decline. [25] Amos would later hint in interviews that during the creation of her next album,
those in charge at the label following the aforementioned merger were interested "only in
making money", the effects of which on the album have not been disclosed. [ citation needed ]

Amos released two more albums with the label, The Beekeeper (2005) and American Doll Posse
(2007). Both albums received mixed reviews, some of which stated that the albums suffered
from being too long. [26] [27] The Beekeeper was conceptually influenced by the ancient art of
beekeeping , which she considered a source of female inspiration and empowerment. Through
extensive study, Amos also wove in the stories of the Gnostic gospels and the removal of women
from a position of power within the Christian church to create an album based largely on
religion and politics . The album debuted at #5 on the Billboard 200 , [28] placing her in an
elite group of women who have secured five or more US Top 10 album debuts. [29] American Doll
Posse , another concept album, was fashioned around a group of girls (the "posse") who are used
as a theme of alter-egos of Amos's. Musically and stylistically, the album saw Amos return to a
more confrontational nature. [30] Like its predecessor, American Doll Posse debuted at #5 on
the Billboard 200 . [14]

During her tenure with Epic Records, Amos also released a retrospective collection titled
Tales of a Librarian (2003) through her former label, Atlantic Records; a two-disc DVD set
Fade to Red (2006) containing most of Amos's solo music videos, released through the Warner
Bros. reissue imprint Rhino; a five disc box set titled A Piano: The Collection (2006),
celebrating Amos's 15 year solo career through remastered album tracks, remixes, alternate
mixes, demos, and a string of unreleased songs from album recording sessions, also released
through Rhino; and numerous official bootlegs from two world tours, The Original Bootlegs
(2005) and Legs & Boots (2007) through Epic Records.

[ edit ] Universal Music years (2008–present)



[ edit ] Universal Republic (2008–2011)



In May 2008, Amos announced that, due to creative and financial disagreements with Epic
Records , she had negotiated an end to her contract with the record label, and would be
operating independently of major record labels on future work. [31] [32] In September of the
same year, Amos released a live album and DVD, Live at Montreux 1991/1992 , through Eagle Rock
Entertainment , of two performances she gave at the Montreux Jazz Festival very early on in her
career while promoting her debut solo album, Little Earthquakes . By December, after a chance
encounter with chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group , Doug Morris , Amos signed a "joint
venture" deal Universal Republic Records . [33] [34] [35] [36]

Abnormally Attracted to Sin , Amos's tenth solo studio-album and her first album released
through Universal Republic, was released in May 2009 to mostly positive reviews. The album
debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 , [37] making it the Amos' seventh album to do so. [38]
Abnormally Attracted to Sin , admitted Amos, was a "personal album", not a conceptual one.
[39] Continuing her distribution deal with Universal Republic, Amos released Midwinter
Graces , her first seasonal album, in November of the same year. The album features reworked
versions of traditional carols, as well as original songs written by Amos. [40]

During her contract with the label, Amos recorded vocals for two songs for David Byrne's
collaboration album with Fatboy Slim , entitled Here Lies Love , [41] which was released in
April 2010. In July of the same year, the DVD Tori Amos- Live from the Artists Den was released
exclusively through Barnes & Noble .

After a brief tour from June to September 2010, Amos released the highly exclusive live album
From Russia With Love in December the same year, recorded live in Moscow on 3 September 2010.
The limited edition set included a signature edition Lomography Diana F+ camera, along with 2
lenses, a roll of film and 1 of 5 photographs taken of Tori during her time in Moscow. The set was
released exclusively through toriamos.com and only 2000 were produced. It is currently
unknown as to whether the album will receive a mass release.

[ edit ] Deutsche Grammophon (2011–present)



In September 2011, Amos released her first classical music album, Night of Hunters ,
featuring variations on a theme to pay tribute to such renowned composers as Bach , Chopin ,
Debussy , Granados , Satie and Schubert , through the Deutsche Grammophon label, a division of
Universal Music Group . She is currently writing the music for Samuel Adamson's musical
adaptation of the George MacDonald story The Light Princess for the Royal National Theatre ,
which was originally expected to debut in spring 2012 [42] but has now been deferred. [43] Amos
has, however, confirmed the release of an album in 2012 marking the 20th anniversary of her
debut album Little Earthquakes . [44] The album will consist of songs from her back catalogue
rearranged and performed by the Metropole Orchestra .

[ edit ] In print



Released in conjunction with The Beekeeper , Amos co-authored an autobiography with rock
music journalist Ann Powers entitled Piece by Piece (2005). The book's subject is Amos's
interest in mythology and religion, exploring her songwriting process, rise to fame, and her
relationship with Atlantic Records.

Image Comics released Comic Book Tattoo (2008), a collection of comic stories, each based on
or inspired by songs recorded by Amos. Editor Rantz Hoseley worked with Amos to gather 80
different artists for the book, including Pia Guerra , David Mack , and Leah Moore .

Additionally, Amos and her music have been the subject of numerous official and unofficial
books, as well as academic critique, including Tori Amos: Lyrics (2001) and an earlier
biography, Tori Amos: All These Years (1996). [45] [46] [47]

"Tori Amos: In the Studio" (2011) by Jake Brown features an in-depth look at Amos's career,
discography and recording process. [48]

In 2011 Adrienne Trier-Bieniek, a sociology graduate student at Western Michigan
University, received her PhD for a dissertation entitled “All I Am: Defining Music as an
Emotional Catalyst through a Sociological Study of Emotions, Gender and Culture".
Trier-Bieniek focused on Amos' female fans and the emotional support they receive from
listening to Amos' music. Along with Patricia Leavy, Trier-Bieniek contributed a chapter to
the book "The Art of Social Critique" [49] which addressed Amos' later albums and songwriting
skills.

Amos is the third child of Rev. Dr. Edison and Mary Ellen Amos. She was born at the Old Catawba
Hospital in Newton, North Carolina , during a trip from their Georgetown home in Washington,
D.C. Her maternal grandparents were of mixed European and Eastern Cherokee ancestry; of
particular importance to her as a child was her grandfather, Calvin Clinton Copeland, who was
a great source of inspiration and guidance to her as a young child, offering a more pantheistic
spiritual alternative to her father and paternal grandmother's traditional Christianity .
[50]

Early in her professional career, Amos befriended author Neil Gaiman , who became a fan after
she referenced him in the song "Tear in Your Hand" and also in print interviews. [51] Although
created before the two met, the character Delirium from Gaiman's The Sandman series (or even
her sister Death ) is inspired by Amos; Gaiman has stated that "they steal shamelessly from
each other". [52] She wrote the foreword to his collection Death: The High Cost of Living ; he in
turn wrote the introduction to Comic Book Tattoo . Gaiman is godfather to her daughter and a
poem written for her birth, Blueberry Girl , was published as a children's book of the same name
in 2009. [53]

Amos married English sound engineer Mark Hawley on February 22, 1998. Their only child, a
daughter named Natashya "Tash" LÃ³rien Hawley, was born in 2000. They divide their time
between Sewall's Point in Florida, Kinsale [54] (County Cork) in Ireland, and Cornwall in
England.

[ edit ] Activism



In June 1994, Amos co-founded RAINN , The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, a toll-free
help line in the US connecting callers with their local rape crisis center. Amos, herself a
survivor of sexual assault, [55] was seen as unlocking the silence of her assault through her
music; thus "Unlock the Silence" went on to become a year-long campaign for RAINN when Amos
became a national spokesperson for the organization. By the summer of 2006, RAINN had
received its one millionth caller [56] and the organization's success has led to it ranking in
"America's 100 Best Charities" by Worth , and one of the "Top 10 Best Charities" by Marie Claire
.

[ edit ] Tours



    Amos, who has been performing in bars and clubs from as early as 1976 and under her
    professional name as early as 1991 has performed more than 1,000 shows since her first
    world tour in 1992. In 2003, Amos was voted fifth best touring act by the readers of Rolling
    Stone magazine. Her concerts are notable for their changing set lists from night to
    night.

        Little Earthquakes Tour

    

        Amos's first world tour began on January 29, 1992 in London and ended on November 30,
        1992 in Auckland . She performed solo with a Yamaha CP-70 unless the venue was able to
        provide a piano. [57] [58] The tour included 142 concerts around the globe.

    

        Under the Pink Tour

    

        Amos's second world tour began on February 24, 1994 in Newcastle upon Tyne and ended
        on December 13, 1994 in Perth, Western Australia . Amos performed solo each night on
        her iconic BÃ¶sendorfer [ citation needed ] piano, and on a prepared piano during
        "Bells for Her". The tour included 181 concerts.

    

        Dew Drop Inn Tour

    

        The third world tour began on February 23, 1996 in Ipswich , England, and ended on
        November 11, 1996 in Boulder . Amos performed each night on piano , harpsichord , and
        harmonium , with Steve Caton on guitar on some songs. The tour included 187 concerts.

    

        Plugged '98 Tour

    

        Amos's first band tour. Amos, on piano and Kurzweil keyboard, was joined by Steve
        Caton on guitar, Matt Chamberlain on drums, and Jon Evans on bass. The tour began on
        April 18, 1998 in Fort Lauderdale and ended on December 3, 1998 in East Lansing,
        Michigan , including 137 concerts.

    

        Five and a Half Weeks Tour / To Dallas and Back

    

        Amos's fifth tour was North America–only. The first part of the tour was
        co-headlining with Alanis Morissette and featured the same band and equipment
        line-up as in 1998. Amos and the band continued for eight shows before Amos embarked
        on a series of solo shows. The tour began on August 18, 1999 in Fort Lauderdale,
        Florida and ended on December 9, 1999 in Denver , including 46 concerts.

    

        Strange Little Tour

    

        This tour was Amos's first since becoming a mother in 2000 and her first tour fully
        solo since 1994 ( Steve Caton was present on some songs in 1996). It saw Amos perform on
        piano, Rhodes piano , and Wurlitzer electric piano , and though the tour was in
        support of her covers album, the set lists were not strictly covers-oriented.
        Having brought her one-year-old daughter on the road with her, this tour was also one
        of Amos's shortest ventures, lasting just three months. It began on August 30, 2001
        in London and ended on December 17, 2001 in Milan , including 55 concerts.

    

        On Scarlet's Walk / Lottapianos Tour

    

        Amos's seventh tour saw her reunited with Matt Chamberlain and Jon Evans, but not
        Steve Caton . The first part of the tour, which featured Amos on piano, Rhodes, and
        Wurlitzer, was six months long and Amos went out again in the summer of 2003 for a tour
        with Ben Folds opening. The tour began on November 7, 2002 in Tampa and ended on
        September 4, 2003 in West Palm Beach , featuring 124 concerts. The final show of the
        tour was filmed and released as part of a DVD/CD set titled Welcome to Sunny Florida
        (the set also included a studio EP titled Scarlet's Hidden Treasures , an extension
        of the Scarlet's Walk album).

    

        Original Sinsuality Tour / Summer of Sin

    

        This tour began on April 1, 2005 in Clearwater, Florida , with Amos on piano, two
        Hammond B-3 organs, and Rhodes. The tour also encompassed Australia for the first
        time since 1994. Amos announced at a concert on this tour that she would never stop
        touring but would scale down the tours. Amos returned to the road in August and
        September for the Summer of Sin North America leg, ending on September 17, 2005 in Los
        Angeles . The tour featured "Tori's Piano Bar", where fans could nominate cover
        songs on Amos's website which she would then choose from to play in a special section
        of each show. One of the songs chosen was the Kylie Minogue hit "Can't Get You Out of My
        Head", which Amos dedicated to her the day after Minogue's breast cancer was
        announced to the public. Other songs performed by Amos include The Doors ' "People
        are Strange", Depeche Mode 's "Personal Jesus", Joni Mitchell 's "The Circle Game",
        Madonna 's " Live to Tell " and " Like a Prayer ", BjÃ¶rk 's " Hyperballad ", Led
