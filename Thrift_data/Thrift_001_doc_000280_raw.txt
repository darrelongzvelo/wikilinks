The Chemistry of BBQ

researcher in the field of biological mass spectrometry, and enjoys writing about
biomedical sciences. Daryl was awarded the CUNY Nobel Science Award in Medicine &
Physiology. When he is not working, Daryl enjoys his three pet dogs (Lucy, Duces, Roccy) and

One of the best joys of a sunny summer day is the gathering of friends and family to enjoy the
enticing aroma and deliciousness of a smoked flamed barbeque. The art of preparing meat and
the technique of grilling has become somewhat of a science in its own. The â€œWorld Series
of Barbequeâ€�, TheÂ  American Royal Barbecue Â Contest is held annually in
Kansas City, Missouri. In Memphis, Tennessee, The World Championship Barbecue Contest
Â is held during the Memphis in May, and according the Guinness Book of World Records it is
said to be the largest pork barbecue contest in the world!

But what is responsible for that taste we all crave? Where does it come from? And how can we make
it taste even better and avoid the unhealthy stuff?

Enthusiasts would say that secret spices or special types of chipped wood influence the
flavor of the meat. Maybe true; but according to chemistry, the fundamental ingredient that
produces flavor in meat is heat ! Commonly observed in a barbecueÂ is a “browning” of
the surface of the meat in a phenomenon called the Maillard reaction .

    This reaction is also responsible for :

    - Toasted bread

    

    - Biscuits

    

    - French Fries

    

    - The distinctive color of beer

    

    - Fried onions

    

    - Dried or condensed milk

    

    - Roasted coffee

    

    - Dulce de leche

    

    - Roasted meat

    

    - The burnished surface (crust) of brioche, cakes, yeast, and quick breads

    

    - Â And maple syrup

The Maillard – “browning” -reaction.

http://www.meninaprons.net/archives

/2007/05/food_dictionary_the_maillard_r.html

The reaction was named after Louis Camille Maillard who first observed it in 1912 while
attempting to replicate biological protein synthesis. Maillard observed that when he
heated amino acids and sugars, the reaction mixture began turning brown. Meat contains
roughly 20% protein . The reaction begins when meat is heated in a process which begins toÂ 
denature Â the proteins contained in meat. Heat disrupts the configuration of these
proteins which results in a slight color change on the surface. At around 300 â€“ 500 F the
Maillard reaction begins to take place.

You observe this reaction while grilling meat.Â  It has also been given attention in
Venezuela where scientists have purportedly developed a novel method of keeping beer fresh .
By adding the drug aminoguanidine and a chemical called 1,2-diaminobenzene (1,2-DAB) to the
beer, the Maillard reaction is manipulated (although scientists don’t know how)!

Aminoguanidine (Left) & 1,2-diaminobenzene (Right)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,2-diaminobenzene

It was not until the 1940s Â that a connection was made between â€œbrowningâ€�
and flavor. According to legend, scientists were attempting to prevent an unappetizing
taste when soldiers began complaining of their eggs (a dehydrated powdered mix) turning
brown and tasting just awful. Although the powdered egg mix was stored at room temperature,
the amount of amino acids and sugars was high enough to stimulate the Maillard reaction. Soon
enough scientists discovered the importance of the Maillard reaction and its central role in
producing flavors and aromas. In fact, after an analysis of beef, over 600 Â different
aroma producing molecules were identified!

The Maillard Reacton & Flavor Production .
http://ediblesciencefaire.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/maillard-reaction/

    Like all chemical reactions, experimental conditions contribute to the final product.
    Likewise, the Maillard reaction is affected or can be manipulated by the following
    conditions:

    1 - Temperature

    

    2 - pH

    

    3 - Water

    

    4 - & marinades (composed mainly of acid, oil, and herbs).

    



Marinades

The acid in marinades Â helps to play a key role in adding flavor to meat. Acid, like heat,
also denatures proteins and creates â€œchannelsâ€� for artificial flavor and
moisture to seep in, giving the meat a â€œjuicierâ€� taste. However, keeping meat
in an acidic environment for an extended time will result in advance degradation of proteins,
making the outer surface layer â€œmushierâ€�. In addition, acids tend to
â€œbrownâ€� less readily, according to Sara J. Risch, a Baltimore flavor chemist
with Science By Design . This is because the Maillard reaction reacts more readily at high pH
values:

Image: http://acsundergrad.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mec2.jpg?w=380&h=192

Mechanism is Initiated in a Basic pH Environment

http://blog.khymos.org/2008/09/26/speeding-up-the-maillard-reaction/

There is a down side to using an acidic solution: the Maillard reaction is inhibited to some
degree, causing a reduction in flavor. Thus, the use of a weak base (such as sodium bicarbonate
â€“baking soda) can speed up the reaction and enhance the flavor of food.Â  You can see
the results of increasing the pH in the video below:

The oil found in marinades is also important. Since cell membranes are mainly composed of a
phospholipid bilayer , oils can easily cross this barrier and further penetrate into the
meat, carrying additional flavors with it.

Chemistry 101: Like dissolves like!

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  “Most flavors tend to be fat-soluble,” says
Risch.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  “It really is the fat that carries the
flavor. A really

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  lean piece of meat just doesn’t carry as
much flavor.”

According to the American Cancer Institute , an added bonus of marinating meat is the
protective effect against harmful carcinogensâ€“ cancer causes compounds- that are
produced during grilling.

At high temperatures, amino acids + sugar + creatine (substance found in muscle), react to
produce cancer-causing compounds collectively called heterocyclic amines , according to
the cancer institute. Another class of carcinogens, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), are formed when fat drips onto hot coals or stones. During flare-ups or via smoke,
these toxic chemicals travel and adhere to the surface of the meat.

Image: http://acsundergrad.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/molec.jpg?w=389&h=134

PAH – Chrysene (Right) & HCA â€“ Î² Carboline

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysene

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Carboline

One way to circumvent and avoid these harmful compounds is by marinating. Nutrition adviser
with the cancer institute, Karen Collins, says that marinating meat can reduce the amount of
heterocyclic amines produced byÂ  as much as 99 percent .

â€œA marinade may act as a “barrier,” keeping flames from directly touching the
meat. Or the protective powers may be due to typical marinade ingredients, such as vinegar,

citrus juice, herbs, spices and olive oil.Â  So think of it as sunscreen for your
meat.â€� Cancer-causing compounds can be further avoided by cutting off any charred
meat before serving says Risch .

So with the right ingredients, a â€œdashâ€� of chemistry, we can turn up the heat
(Not too high now!), pop open a cold one (I like lemonade, but thatâ€™s just me), and kick
it with some friends at the grill! Maybe talk about chemistry?Â  Or grilling?Â  After
all, they are one and the same!

    Here areÂ my healthy grilling tips :

    - Avoid â€œfattyâ€� pieces of meat â€“ or pre-boil Â to reduce the
    amount of fat.

    

    - Always marinate meat â€“ significantly reduces HCAs formed.

    

    - A moderate browning of the meat is okay â€“ avoid excess browning or charring as
    carcinogens are produced.

    

    - Sugar Â containing sauces are tasty, but burn easily and contributes to the the
    production of HCAs â€“ use those type of sauces close to the end.

    

    - Lastly, eating barbeque frequently is not healthy as harmful chemicals may tend to
    build up if not given time to be metabolized and excreted.

Dendritic Cells: The Cancer Vaccine Era

Posted on June 1, 2012 by Daryl Ramai Reply

Daryl is a chemistry graduate of York College of The City University of New York. He is an avid
researcher in the field of biological mass spectrometry, and enjoys writing about
biomedical sciences. Daryl was awarded the CUNY Nobel Science Award in Medicine &
Physiology. When he is not working, Daryl enjoys his three pet dogs and traveling.

Have you ever wondered about how the body defends itself from invasions and
attacksÂ fromÂ harmful pathogens while working to produce life long & robust
immunity? Or what about those complex diseases we hearÂ so much offÂ on that TV Show
“House”?

Well, Ralph M. Steinman was similarly curious. Steinman not only found the answer, but he was
awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology/ Medicine for discovering dendritic cells (DC),
cells which serve as the directors of your body’s defense system.Â  Steinmanâ€™s
finding elucidated what once was enigmatic, while simultaneously unifying separate
fieldsÂ within immunology (innate & adaptive), and he has transformed the way scientist
and doctors look atÂ complex diseases such as cancers and autoimmune disorders.
Steinman, a professor of Immunology and senior physician at The Rockefeller University,
used his Nobel Prize winning knowledge in an attempt to treat his own pancreatic cancer . Alas,
he tragically died after a four year battle against the disease, even as his work has the
potential to save countless others.

Figure 1: The Dendritic Cell.
http://www.realscience.us/2011/10/03/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-immunologists/

DCs were first discovered in 1968 as Langerhans cells (specialized DC of the skin). According
to the Laboratory Cellular Physiology and Immunology, Steinmanâ€™s discovery came
while studying the induction of immune responses in a major lymphoid organ, a known site for
the generation of immature progenitor cells into mature lymphocytes. There, he noticed the
presence of a group of cells scientist hadÂ regarded as being eitherÂ macrophages or
accessory cells. However, fromÂ Steinman’s previous work & experience with phages and
immunity,Â his analysis of the cell convinced him he had stumbled across a distinct class.

Further examination of the role of DCs revealed that they were able to direct and coordinate
both innate (non-specific) and adaptive (leading to specificity) immune responses .
Precursor DCs patrol the blood stream, like sentinels, while immature DCs reside in tissues.
Both forms are positioned and poised for the capture of foreign infectious antigens . After
attacking and absorbing the foreign invaders, DCs migrate to lymphoid organs.
Simultaneously they undergo phenotypic & functional maturation, and, in what I like to call
the â€œ3 Ps,â€� process, package, and present pathogen antigenic patterns , i.e.
molecular structures, on their cell surface. The cell extends from its body, long tentacle
like structures. This enables the DC to capture foreign cells and then communicate
effectively (using these molecular patterns) with T-cell lymphocytes. Thanks to the DC’s
“alarm”, T-cells are activated, proliferate, and differentiate into Natural Kill
cells which attack and degrade infected cells.

A robust feature of DCs are their ability to induce differentiated T-cells to acquire
â€œmemoryâ€� of these antigenic patterns for prolong periods. This allows a rapid
response in the case of similar and future attacks. This also allows the immune system to
“remember” an immunologic historical library of diseases.

Another interesting and vital task of DC is its capacity to induce T-cells into Helper cells
which in turn stimulate B-cells to transform into Plasma cells . Plasma cells are the
bodyâ€™s biological factory for the manufacturing of antibodies which neutralize the
invading pathogen.

According to the Food and Drug Administration, DCs have been recognized as an immune therapy
that harnesses the bodyâ€™s own defense mechanisms to fight cancers . In patients of
compromised or suppressed DC activity, studies on tumor cells have shown that if DCs can be
extracted from the body, presented with antigens of the disease in treatment, and reinfused
into the patientâ€™s blood stream, tumors caused by the disease reduce in size and
immunity against that disease is acquired. As a result, today there are 49 completed and 116
current clinical trials which utilize dendritic based cell therapies in the treatment of
cancers such as prostate, ovarian, glioblastoma, melanoma, lymphoma, and renal cell
carcinoma. The crowning jewel of which is the development of a cancer vaccine , which has had
great success. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on April 29, 2010, approved the first
ever cancer vaccine, a treatment that trains the body’s own immune system to fight
cancerous tumors in the prostate. The treatment cost about $93,000 per patient and is
available in 50 cancer treatment centers across the U.S. The vaccine, called Provenge
(generic name sipuleucel-T), was developed by a Seattle-based biotech company, Dendreon
Corporation. Lori Valigra, Mass High Tech correspondent, writes that â€œVaccines
represent a relatively new approach to fighting the spread of cancer, having appeared in the
last decadeâ€� (see previous link).Â  Valigra explains that the underlying
doctrine â€œis similar to a vaccine for a disease like measles: an injection in the arm
induces an immune response that helps the body fight a particular pathogen, in this case, a
cancer. An effective immune response would then shrink tumors and extend lives.â€�

Hailed as the â€œdawning of the vaccine era,â€� Thomas Davis, MD, senior vice
president and chief medical officer at Celldex Therapeutics Inc.Â Davis noted,

â€œa critical turning point for cancer vaccines was the discovery by Drs. Ralph Steinman
and Zanvil A. Cohn [co-discoverer]Â at Rockefeller University in New York of dendritic
cells, which are pivotal to the immune system. The cells donâ€™t work well in patients
with cancer. Thereâ€™s still a lot we do not know, but we are getting a better sense of how
dendritic cells work and how cancer suppresses them.â€�


http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2011/06/20/weekly11-Cancer-vaccines-make-progress-in-combating-disease.html

In the past doctors were limited to traditional chemotherapeutical drugs, but with the
approval coming from FDA for developing DC based therapies, we are indeed harnessing the
bodyâ€™s natural biological and immuno-regulatory agents to cure illnesses. Dr.
Edgar Engleman, one of the innovators of Provenge, believes that the approval of this new form
of treatment may in fact â€œherald a new wave of cancer treatments that will not
necessarily come with the many negative side effects typically associated with
chemotherapy and radiation therapy.”

WhileÂ a complete cancer vaccine may be years away, discoveries such as Steinman’s
often take years to come to their full fruition. Just as Pierre and Marie Curie could not have
know the place of radiation in our lives today, so too are the possibilities of dendritic cell
therapy. Dr. Steinman is no longer with us, but the knowledge he has left about how the body
defends itself from invasions and attacksÂ fromÂ harmful pathogens while working to
produceÂ adaptive immunity will forever be a part of our lives in the 21st century and
beyond. Posted in Chemistry research , Nobel Prizes | Tagged Biological Chemistry , Cancer ,
