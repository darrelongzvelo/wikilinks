Audio Books Resource: Project Gutenberg Offers Free Classics on Audio

reading a review of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the unique new blend of the classic with
the strange, by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith (read by Katherine Kellgren).

I had two thoughts: I have to listen to this book and I have to read the original again first.

I read Pride and Prejudice in high school and barely remember the plot. I certainly no longer
own a copy.

Thatâ€™ s when I turned to Project Gutenberg and was pleasantly surprised at the
availability of a free audiobook version of the classic.

Project Gutenberg



If you are unfamiliar with Project Gutenberg, it is the largest collection of free eBooks
available for download. It was founded by Michael Hart in 1971 with the idea that anything
entered into a computer can then be duplicated an infinite number of times, allowing anyone in
the world with a computer to access the materials.

With that in mind, eBooks are offered in formats compatible with old and new computers alike,
with editions that meet the needs of every reader . This practice is in keeping with the
philosophy of making texts available in the public domain accessible to the largest number of
readers.

Whether you are looking for light reading, heavy literature, or reference books, Project
Gutenberg has something for you.

The Audio Component



In September of 2003, Project Gutenberg began offering Audio eBooks. Titles are available in
computer-generated and human voice formats.

The computer-generated voice audio eBook list is no longer being expanded; rather titles are
being made available on a demand basis. Current titles in this list may be reviewed at
Computer-Generated Titles.

Human-read titles are still being added. Preferable to most audio listeners, these titles
range from Peter Pan to King Lear. Easily downloadable files are available in varied formats
on multiple sites as well as mirror sites. The Human-Voice Read Titles are found here;

Pride and Prejudiceâ€Š and Zombies?



With my free copy of Pride and Prejudice safely downloaded to my iPod , Iâ€™m off to do some
gardening. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy will be fresh in my mind when I explore their world
againâ€Š and find out where the brain eating zombies come in.

Reading and writing are my passions. I read a lot of paper books as well as listen to audiobooks
utilizing playaways from the local library. I listen to most of my audiobooks on my iPod. I read
about one book/week and am rarely seen without one in hand. Come along and discuss this article
in our friendly community forum.
