Jai Ho – Why Gulzar is nominated for the Oscars



January 28, 2009 4 Comments

Let’s start by posting the lyrics of Jai Ho (in poetry form)

Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho

Aaja Aaja Jinda Shamiyane Ke Tale

Aaja Zariwale Nile Aasman Tale

Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho

Ratti Ratti Sachi Maine Jaan Gavayi Hai

Nach Nach Koylo Pe Raat Bitayi Hai

Akhiyon Ki Neend Maine Phoonk Se Uda Di

Neele Neele Tare Maine Ungli Jalayi Hai

Chakh Le, Ha Chakh Le, Ye Raat Shahad Hai…Â  Chakh Le

Rakh Le, Ha Dil Hai, Dil Aakhri Had Hai…Â  Rakh Le

Kala Kala Kajal Tera Koi Kala Jadoo Hai Na

Kala Kala Kajal Tera Koi Kala Jadoo Hai Na

Kab Se, Ha Kab Se Jo Lab Pe Ruki Hai.. Kah De

Kah De, Ha Kah De Ab Aankh Jhuki Hai.. Kah De

Aisi Aisi Roshan Aankhe Roshan Dono Bhi Hai Hai Kya

Aaja Aaja Jind Shamiyane Ke Tale

Aaja Jariwale Nile Aasman Tale

Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho

Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho, Jai Ho

So what’s the big deal about these lyrics? Right, let’s analyse. I am not much of a Hindi
widhwan but I will give it a shot.

The slum boy spends his life without a roof over his head. All he has is the sky. The sky that is
alive with stars and planets and galaxies and is his roof ( zinda shamiana ); the sky that looks
like a gold threaded blanket ( zariwale neele aakash )

The boy lives his life through bit by bit ( ratti ratti ); Spending his nights ( raat bitayi )
after surviving through all possible ordeals ( nach nach koylo – dancing on coals) ; He has
dismissed all sleep and rest ( Ankhiyon Ke Neend Main Phoonk Se Uda Di – just like blowing out a
candle ); And burnt himself trying to catch his stars, his luck, his fortune ( Neele Neele Tare
Maine Ungli Jalayi Hai )

Now that victory is here, it is time to taste sweet success for the first time ( Chakh Le… Ye
Raat Shahad Hai ); Finally, it is the heart ( Dil Aakhri Had Hai ) that keeps one going ( Rakh Le )

- Danny Boyle’s view of the slum life – spirit of life that keeps people going

What you wanted to say for a long time, was on your tongue for ever ( Jo Lab Pe Ruki Hai ), let it out
now that there is someone waiting for it in complete surrender ( Aankhe jhuki hai )

- in these two lines, the entire romance of Jamal and Latika is described.

Gulzar is the master of the Hindi metaphor – No high sounding Urdu or big words – simple
common street language but used as metaphors for describing a world beyond. And this song is an
excellent example of his craft. My favourite is of course the main two lines with the zinda
shamiana and zariwale neele asmaan .

The Oscar might well be his. And deservedly so.

Electoral Malpractices – 2008 Weblog Awards



January 15, 2009 Leave a comment

Amit Varma who writes the highly popular India Uncut blog was nominated in two categories –
Best Political Coverage and Best Asian Blog .Â 

In the Best Political Coverage category, there was FiveThirtyEight Â which won 56% of the
44,000+ votes that were polled. India Uncut picked up 1.6%, a decent show considering the Amit
did not fancy his chances too much.

However, in the Best Asian Blog, there was a scandal. Till Sunday night, India Uncut was
leading by at least 10 percentage points. However, as Amit narrates…

Regular voters would no doubt have noted that the healthy lead Iâ€™ve held from the start
has now vanished. The manner in which this has happenedâ€”most of it disappeared in a
two-hour spell a few hours agoâ€”is befuddling, and Deepak Iyer points me to this
message board entry that might provide some clues. I have no idea if cheating is actually going
on, and will not make that assumption about anyone unless proof is there. That said, I am also
taking the numbers up there right now with a pinch of salt.

The concerned blog was the Burmese blog Ashin Mettacara . It was later found that a number of
votes were illegal – using a technique called “ rinse and repeat “. This allows for
multiple votes to be sent from the same machine inspite of the restrictions on the same. Over
500 votes were found to be illegal (and 60 votes of Amit as well)

In the end, Amit lost out by a mere 192 votes out of the 8,000+ polled. Â  The blog awards
committee adjusted the votes . However, as the administrator says, both blog authors never
wished for such methods to be used. They may have been some enthusiastic Burmese soul rallying
round Ashin’s war cry to unify all Burmese around his cause . (with Obama as the copywriter).

Am sure, Amit, the Stoic that he is, will find a chin to take the loss.

Angel Investing



January 15, 2009 Leave a comment

Prem Panicker tweeted news of Natalie Dylan (no relation to Bob Dylan – nothing has been
confirmed to contrary anyway) auctioning off her virginity. The story goes that in order to
fund her future education, the 22 year old has decided to deflower herself to the highest
bidder. The current bid stands at $3.7 million.

The original announcement happened last year with full blurbs on CNN and the like .

The social “opinion” apart, we were wondering whether this will open up new vistas for
frustrated bankers and corporate honchos. We were proposing “virgin investments” and
“angel funding” – be an angel to us and we put up your education.

Ghastly stuff, eh! But it’s a free world.

Microblogging – 140 characters be damned



January 15, 2009 Leave a comment

All the different presentations on Slideshare about the marvel that is Twitter focus on the
concept of microblogging – in 140 characters , one expresses the essence of one’s life. Of
course, the student of Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy does not need anything more than two
digits, maybe three if he wants to be cryptic and write “7×6″.

However, couple Â of particular individuals whom I follow on Twitter are probably unaware
that they are not conforming to the generalisations propounded about this medium.

One such gentleman is Mr. Prem Panicker . A distinguished writer, journalist and cricket fan,
Mr. Panicker (or Prem to friends – not to be confused with Prem, the alter ego of Salman Khan or
Prem, Prem Chopra) is one for whom the phrase “ a man of few words ” does not apply. But
fortunately, unlike similar afflicted people like Arundhati Roy and an aging Salman
Rushdie, Prem does not suffer from verbal diarrhoea.Â 

This elaborate introduction about Prem Panicker is in aid of furthering the argument that
Twitter need not be a 140 character limited telegraphic communication engine.Â 

For example, today, he tweeted (is there a word) on the on-going Ranji trophy finals :

While on Ranji, Amish Sahiba appears set to be man of the match again — if you define MoM as the
person playing the most influential role.

The dismissal of Kaif was unfortunate — and “oddly enough”, his mistakes tend to favor
Mumbai most of the time.

That said, not entirely sure what Kaif’s UP thinks it is doing. Digging deep and focusing on
accumulation through attrition is fine.

But 117 runs in 60 overs? That kind of stasis puts all the pressure on the batting side, and lets
the fielding side free to call the play.

Parvinder earlier this month was on song — in fact, his partnership with Shivkant Shukla
helped UP edge ahead of TN in the semis.

That’s a nice feeling to take into this partnership between the same two players

If they can reprise their knocks of 138 and 178 NO from the semis, they can still give Mumbai a
scare. 1 wkt though, and Mumbai is home.

When you spend 30 overs scoring 55 runs, it does strange things to your mind.

Flashy shots are what such a mindset eschews, but typically, flash is what batsmen tend to
perish to in such situations.

Pity about Parvinder. Shivkant Shukla doing well, but he has too little support left to
conceive of getting the 231 runs UP needs to lead.

And this is true even for replies which would make one-line email replies die of shame.

Of course, the twitter scoop of Mumbai terror attacks is well publicised. This leads to
relooking at the Twitter status message question, “What are you doing?”

To this, @ddeeps Â gave as answer, “ Most ppl unfollow for noise. I unfollow for silence.
Why do ppl.who never engage in convos with me feel miffed if unfollowed is a mystery. “

This of course begs the question, what is the meaning of “doing”? Does “what are you
doing” also mean “what are you thinking”? What are you ranting about? What are you
watching? What are you reading? What are you saying?….

Doing means experiencing life…

James Bond Speaks English



January 12, 2009 1 Comment

Pushing training programmes requires some reference point. And when it comes to learning to
speak English, what better than James Bond? Learn to speak English like James Bond.

Â 

Image:
http://anannyad.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/speakenglish_jamesbond.jpg?w=630

Speak English Like James Bond

There is even a “100% guarantee”. My only issue, James Bond has been played by many actors
who were Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Australian and English. They all had different accents,
styles and voices. In this poster, the photograph of Roger Moore is used.

So what does “speak English like James Bond” really constitute? What is it that I am
getting a guarantee for? If something is not happening, what do I claim for in the guarantee?

Not clear at all.

Why is Kumble smiling in Dadar?



January 12, 2009 1 Comment

Anil Kumble Promoting MBA courses

In Dadar, Mumbai one fine morning I saw this – the smiling face of Anil Kumble with the logo of
some university emblazoned on his blazer and all the other courses mentioned.

I could not get it. For a man of his stature to be used in a cloth banner to promote a local business
management training programme – not good.

The Ashes 2009 – The First Words



January 9, 2009 Leave a comment

Gideon Haig of the Guardian gets off the block with the first words on the 2009 Ashes series with
a look at two teams who seem to be at odds with themselves than with any opponent.

He says, about the current mess in which English cricket lies in (For those who came in late, KP
has resigned as captain as has their coach Peter Moores)

For years English cricketers have obsessed over that mysterious dark art of their Australian
rivals defined by Steve Waugh as “mental disintegration”. At last they seem to have
mastered it â€“ except in one crucial respect. They have forgotten you are meant to apply
it to your opponents rather than yourselves.

On the Australians, he says, very wittily,

At the moment Ricky Ponting’s Australians are a little like the world economy: nobody seems
quite sure whether to expect a short, sharp recession or a long, enervating depression.

Overall, it’s another six months before the first ball. Australia have a three test match
away series against South Africa, England a test series in the West Indies. Australia needs to
get their aggressive dominating cricket back on track while England, for starters, needs a
steady and confident captain in place.

Ricky Ponting has already lost one Ashes series, the last one played in England. It could be the
end of his captaincy if he were to lose another (assuming he remains the captain till the Ashes
– most likely he will be the captain).

Australia – The Movie and some history



January 7, 2009 Leave a comment

    Baz Lurhman’s Australia was a long film. Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge had us all tuned
    into some really good entertaining treatment of two love stories. Here in Australia, the
    length of the film gets multiplied by the sheer lack of entertaining features (as I was
    wont to expect from a Baz Luhrman film). Instead, it was a three hour long saga that had
    various plot elements that seemed to be a recreation of Gone With The Wind. It was all there
    -Â 

    1 - Large property in the outback

    

    2 - Lady of the house comes into ownership due to sudden events (death of her husband)

    

    3 - Racism

    

    4 - War

    

    5 - Love between two strangers

    

    6 - Brave rescues

    

    7 - Redemption

    

    8 - Reunion (This wasn’t there in Gone With The Wind)

    



There were a few things about the film that seemed to be truly good – the Aborigine kid actor
Brandon Walters who acts as Nullah; the cinematography by Australian Mandy Walker and a
couple of neat scenes.Â 

As a history buff, there were two points of interest in this film – The Stolen Generation and
The Japanese Raids on Darwin during the Second World War .

The Stolen Generation

    The Stolen Generation has been a cause of much repentence amongst most Australians over
    the last many years. Between 1869 and 1969, Aboriginal (or Indigenous Australians or
    Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Island Peoples) children were forcibly taken
    away from their parents and raised in missionaries or charities or as foster-children in
    white families. They were kept here till the age of 18 after which they were returned to
    their original families. There was three main rationale behind these programmes
    (mandated by laws passed by the Australian Federal and State parliaments)

    1 - Child Protection – it was believed that children would be best taken care off by the
    state in order to protect them from disease

    

    2 - Preventing extinction of the race – with population of the indigenous Australians
    declining, it was felt that by raising the children by the state, they would be more
    healthy and hence more capable of development

    

    3 - Protecting white race purity – this was a third view point which had a minority
    support group.

    



Cathy Freeman lit the Olympic torch at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Cathy, an Aboriginal
Australian, was the grandchild of one such Stolen child. Midnight Oil, the cult Aussie band,
demonstrated the national regret when they performed at the closing ceremony of the Olympic
Games wearing black sweatshirts with the word “Sorry”.Â 

There was of course a national apology by the Australian PM Kevin Rudd and an unanimous
resolution by the Federal Parliament.

Japanese raids on Darwin

The next big point of interest is the advent of Second World War in Australia. This was the raid
on Darwin by Japanese bombers on February 19, 1942. Called the Pearl Harbour of Australia,
this raid in two waves attacked Australia at its weakest and most vulnerable point –
completely underprepared and underequipped.

It remains the biggest attack on Australian soil though Japan never really occupied any
Australian territory (in the main continent). The raids were executed by a combination of the
Kate torpedo bombers and the Val dive bombers escorted by Zero fighters. The second wave was
executed by Nell and Betty land-based bombers.

Naval commander Mitsui Fuchida who led the first wave later in his memoirs writes that it was a
significant waste of time as there was nothing of any value at Darwin – a small port
installation, an even smaller airfield with minimal facilities.Â 

Closing up on the movie – well, a movie buff is a movie buff – so one can watch it. And the movie
will definitely do well in the awards marquees across the world. The only issue – its a big too
heavy on the sugar and teary stuff.

Revolutionary Road – Review of a Review of a Trailer



January 6, 2009 Leave a comment

I came across this review by Anna Pickard of the Guardian of the movie trailer of Revolutionary
Road . It stars Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet and is directed by Sam Mendes.

A few excerpts which I found interesting.

About Leonardo Di Caprio:

We in the cheap seats wonder if there’s something magic in supermodel spittle that promises
to keep Leo looking like he’s in primary school possibly into his 70s.

[...]

I guess I kind of like it, ” says Leo, through gritted teeth.

“ Won’t you miss the city? ” asks a heavily pregnant Kate.Â 

“Nothing’s permanent â€Š “ Â replies the 12-year-old in a suit.Â 

About the trailer and the impact of the trailer:

Leonardo DiCaprio looks tortured. Kate Winslet looks miserable. If Titanic was the flush of
first love, this is what happens when it subsequently all goes down the toilet.

[...]

Seriously, I feel like all the joy has been sucked from my soul, and I’ve only been watching
this for one minute and 45 seconds. The film is two sodding hours long. I wonder if the cinema
staff have to go in at the end of each screening and pick up not only the empty cups and sweetie
wrappers but also the shattered dreams of any foolish youthful idealists in the audience and
the hollow, desiccated shells of cinemagoers with nothing left to live for.

Prediction about the movie:

So, at the end of the day, is it a trailer that makes us want to rush out and watch the entire film?
No, not really. It’s already raining, and we’re feeling a bit flat and fat and
January-miserable and â€Š no. It will probably win prizes, though. Armloads of ‘em.

I saw the trailer myself and I tend to agree. Given the general mood of the day, I would be a tad
wary of going for it. I saw Australia the other day and it was like watching a Gone With The Wind
saga-esque drama with an Aussie accent – complete with racism, war, greed and villainy.
Like what Anna Pickard says about Revolutionary Road, armloads of prizes am sure, for Hugh
Jackman, Nicole Kidman, the kid who plays Nallah, maybe cinematography. But, not enjoyable
watching.

The Art of Elephanta



January 5, 2009 Leave a comment

The Gharapuri Island , about 11 kms North East of Apollo Bunder (The Gateway of India) is
popularly called Elephanta . It houses a set of Shaivist caves – i.e. dedicated to Shiva,
probably carved around 7th Century AD.Â  Â Â 



Image:
http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KEPbkfWm_Hs/SWD1apyIasI/AAAAAAAAADs/hgDRxzTqjGM/s400/IMG_4415.JPG

Â 

This is the Sadashiva – The Panchmukhi Shiva (Five Headed). This image is ubiquitious in
most tourist brochures of India and Mumbai

See the Full AlbumÂ  The Art of Elephanta

The most famous image from the Caves, indeed to main image of the page is the Tri-headed Shiva,
called Sadashiva. According to the legend in the guide books, this idol represents the five
faces of Shiva (Panchmukha Shiva) – three of which is visible. The fourth face is implied (at
the back) and the fifth is the mythical face unseen by any mortal.

Another interesting image is that of Ravana holding aloft Mount Kailasha

Image:
http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KEPbkfWm_Hs/SWD4kxQcBWI/AAAAAAAAAE0/gbudrM4ICZg/s400/IMG_4434.JPG

Ravana holding aloft Mount Kailasha, with Shiva sitting on top of the mountain

From The Art of Elephanta

For those who regularly visit historical places in India would be aware of the lousy work done
by ASI to maintain these priceless examples of Indian heritage. Here in Elephanta it was sheer
commerce that was keeping it thriving. Libertarians and free marketers I am sure would be very
happy. The local population (who seemed to be descendents of the Siddis – taking a guess on
the basis of their physical features) were doing their all – well run restaurants, shops
selling all kinds of stones, palkhis, guides, cleaners, even a monkey watcher.

Cave art in India is aplenty. In Mumbai itself, besides Elephanta, we have Jogeshwari ,
Kanheri (inside Borivili National Park), Mahakali (Junction of SEEPZ and the
Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road) and Mandapeshwar. While Elephanta is a set of temples
dedicated to Shiva, Kanheri and Mahakali are of Buddhist origins.

One also saw a lot of tourists especially the foreigners making their way to Elephanta. No
doubt, they were refering to the Lonely Planet and following Tony Wheeler’s suggestions
.Â 

The enormous central bust of Shiva, its eyes closed in eternal contemplation, may be the most
serene sight you witness in India.
