throughout the United States each year, where they still employ many of the same practices and
techniques used in their aerial displays in 1946. Since their inception, the Blues have flown
a variety of different aircraft types for more than 427 million spectators worldwide.It is
such a treat to see them practice at their home base. Stay tuned for more information when they
