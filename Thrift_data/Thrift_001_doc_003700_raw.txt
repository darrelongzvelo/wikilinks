Â 

People do it. Â  Companies do it. Â  Even educated cities do it . Â  Let’s do it, let’s
let states go bankrupt. Â

One government, for sale â€“ cheap!

Â 

That is the entirely logical premise behind a carefully reasoned Weekly Standard article
from the eminently qualified David Skeel of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

Â 

Give States a Way to Go Bankrupt

Itâ€™s the best option for avoiding a massive federal bailout

Â 

State bankruptcy is an idea whose time has come. Â

Can one of the states also go bankrupt?

Â 

We need it as a financial tool. Â  (No less a practical authority than Richard Ravitch thinks
New York State needs bankruptcy .) Â  Unfortunately, it’ll take an act of Congress
â€“ but before we despair about the paralysis and contention gripping Washington,
let’s understand why we need it.

Â 

Previous posts have established sovereign bankruptcy as a rapidly growing phenomenon that
will dominate the current decade, and highlighted the challenges of bankrupting a sovereign
nation ( like Greece ), a municipality (like Harrisburg, PA ), or a government
instrumentality (like Dubai World ). Â 

Â 

Anyone who proposed even a decade ago that a state should be permitted to file for bankruptcy
would have been dismissed as crazy. But times have changed.

Â 

We’ve seen the fiscal calamity in California , which is unbelievably topped by that of
Illinois (“making California look penurious and honest”). Â 

Â 

As Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€™s plea for $7 billion of federal assistance for California
earlier this year made clear, the states are the next frontier in â€œtoo big to
fail.â€� Â 

Â

Except Lehman was allowed to fail

Â 

The public normally conflates two different bankruptcy outcomes: (1) dissolution and
shutdown, and (2) court-imposed restructuring of debts for a re-emergent going concern.
Â  In casually using phrases like ‘too big to fail,’ the public presumes that allowing
an enterprise to exist as a going concern (say, GM) necessarily means having a senior and
larger credit source (say, the US government) fund all the liabilities (except those that it
can bully into submission , using sovereign coercion).

Â 

In fact, there’s a much less fatal option â€“ allowing the debtor to discount its debts
in a structured way, and hence to emerge as a viable enterprise with a newly recapitalized
capital stack .

Â 

In the topsy-turvy world we now inhabit, letting states file for bankruptcy to shed some of
their obligations could save American taxpayers a great deal of money.

Whichever way you flip us, we land on our tires!

Â 

As I posted a year ago, bankruptcy was invented as a way out of debtor’s prison , which
everyone recognized made a great deterrent to excessive debt but a dreadful means of
resolving it, and was designed to be used when the debtor is a private-sector entity subject to
the law. Â  When applied to a public body, its principles need reworking.

Â 

Private-sector entities . Â  For the normal insolvent debtor â€“ one whose
liabilities exceed its assets, with no prospects for short-term increase in asset value
â€“ bankruptcy is a device where, voluntarily or involuntarily, the debtor can have its
debt discounted and its assets surrendered. Â  Involuntary bankruptcy â€“ where the
government via the court system compels an entity to surrender its assets in exchange for debt
restructuring â€“ exists to allow creditors to override a debtor that is subverting the
debt system by relying on its invulnerability to asset seizure. Â  Key here is that the
government overrides private property rights that the debtor has forfeited via its
insolvency.

Â 

Public-sector entities , being arms of the government, face a different environment, since
it’s potentially incongruous for one arm of the government to be twisting another
governmental arm.

Nobody move or the sheriff gets it!

Â 

Hence bankruptcy of a sub-Â­ national arm, like a municipality or a state, is predicated on
supervision by a higher-level national arm, and as we saw with Harrisburg, municipal
bankruptcy can only be voluntary (not involuntary) and requires the state to make findings of
insolvency before allowing the municipality to file. Â 

Â 

Municipal bankruptcy differs in a few key respects from the law applying to nongovernmental
entities. Unlike with corporations, a cityâ€™s creditors are not permitted to throw
the city into bankruptcy.

Â 

Subjecting municipal bankruptcy to a higher-level state approval first is for creditor
protection, since a municipality that cannot be dissolved could be cavalier about declaring
bankruptcy so as to discount its debts and emerge on the far side with unjustified new equity.

I’m from the government and I’m here to adjudicate your debts

Â 

When it comes to insolvency, nations have a tool that states do not â€“ they can deflate
their currency, or see the markets deflate it for them through inflation. Â  Markets will
punish sovereign nations by pummeling their currency down, which in turn drives up that
nation’s borrowing costs in the global financial markets.

Â 

(Sidebar: the Euro crisis arises from the fundamental paradox of a single currency being used
by multiple financially sovereign states. Â  Individual states cannot deflate their
currencies, an action that would ordinarily have happened year ago to Greece, Portugal, and
Italy. Â  Instead, the Euro’s strength drove Euro interest rates so low that the smaller
nations could each act as their own Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac , turbocharging their economies
and hyperinflating asset prices. Â  They could also use the cheap borrowing to
over-promise their retirees with wildly unsustainable social-welfare safety nets, all of
which are now in tatters. Â  That’s why the series of Eurozone bailouts must necessarily
fail to stem the financial fear â€“ either the subsidiary nations get their finances in
line with Eurozone requirements, or the stronger economies, led by Germany, will have to quit
the Euro, returning to their original currencies and letting the Euro deflate like a
collapsing souffle.)

We failed to make the pie higher

Â 

With that as a (long) preamble, we’re now ready to look at Professor Skeel’s
prescription: authorize states to go bankrupt by adding a section of the bankruptcy code,
drawing from the municipal-bankruptcy statutes, and adapting to that higher level of
government.

Â 

The financial mess that spendthrift states have gotten themselves into is well known.
Californiaâ€”recently dubbed the â€œLindsay Lohan of statesâ€� in the Wall
Street Journalâ€”has a deficit that could reach $25.4 billion next year, and
Illinoisâ€™s deficit for the 2011 fiscal year may be in the neighborhood of $15 billion.

Once I was sunny and fresh â€Š no more

Â 

There is little evidence that either state has a recipe for bringing down its runaway
expenses, a large portion of which are wages and benefits owed to public employees. This means
we can expect a major push for federal funds to prop up insolvent state governments in 2011
â€“

Â 

There may be such a push â€“ certainly no governor could be expected not to plead for
Federal support, preferably in large amounts with few strings attached â€“ but the
nation cannot afford to keep piling other insolvencies onto an already bloated Federal
deficit.

Â 

â€“ unless some miraculous alternative emerges to save the day.

Â 

This is where bankruptcy comes in.

Â 

When the possibility is mentioned of creating a new chapter for states in U.S. bankruptcy law
(Chapter 8, perhaps, which isnâ€™t currently taken), most people have two reactions.

Â 

First, that bankruptcy might be a great solution for exploding state debt

Second, that it canâ€™t possibly be constitutional for Congress to enact such a law.

Â 

Surprisingly enough, this reaction is exactly backwards.

Â

You claiming my reasoning’s reversed?

Â 

The constitutionality of bankruptcy-for-states is beyond serious dispute. The real
question is whether the benefits would be large enough to justify congressional action. The
short answer is yes.

Â 

That’s actually the first real question â€“ the second being whether Congress will
actually do anything in time. Â 

Â 

Although bankruptcy would be an imperfect solution to out-of-control state deficits,
itâ€™s the best option we have, at least if we want to have any chance of avoiding massive
federal bailouts of state governments.

Â 

Tomorrow’s post will be soon enough to address the enactment challenges â€“ for now,
we can tackle the Constitutional issues.

Â 

The main objection to bankruptcy for states is that it would interfere with state
sovereigntyâ€”the Constitutionâ€™s protections against federal meddling in
state affairs. The best known such barrier is the Tenth Amendment, but the structure of the
Constitution as a whole is designed to give the states a great deal of independence.

Â 

Yet if a state acts independently, as it does for its budgeting (for instance) and state-level
programs, then a fortiori it has to be held independently accountable for its profligacy.
Â  In other words, if states have their own Constitutions and their own budgets, then they
have to be bankruptable, otherwise we’re back in the Eurozone trap.

Â

One way to look at it

Â 

This concern is easily addressed. So long as a state canâ€™t be thrown into bankruptcy
against its will , and bankruptcy doesnâ€™t usurp state lawmaking powers,
bankruptcy-for-states can easily be squared with the Constitution.

Â 

This is no problem â€“ municipalities can go bankrupt, but only voluntarily.

Â 

The solution also creates a second concern. If the bankruptcy framework treads gingerly on
state prerogatives, as it must to be constitutional, it may be exceedingly difficult for a
bankruptcy court to impose the aggressive measures a state needs to get its fiscal house in
order.

Â 

Neither of these considerationsâ€”state sovereignty or the limited force of a
bankruptcy framework that gives wide berth to governmental decision-makersâ€”is
hypothetical. We now have more than 70 years of experience with a special chapter of the
bankruptcy codeâ€”now called Chapter 9â€”which permits cities and other
municipal entities to file for bankruptcy. Â 

Â

Bankruptcy is wild, man

Â 

The experience of these municipal bankruptcies [ Orange County in 1994 , Vallejo California
now , and potentially Harrisburg â€“ Ed.] shows how bankruptcy-for-states might work,
what its limitations are, and why we need it now.

Â

Yes, opportunities to overpay civil servants

Â 

No two ways about it, municipal bankruptcy will be a wave of the future â€“ there’s no
other way so many localities can dig themselves out of long-term municipal-bond payments or
overburdened pension obligations. Â  We may even reach the Depression’s bankruptcy
rate:

Coming to a Conference of Mayors near you





Municipal bankruptcy dates back to the last epic financial crisis, the Great Depression of
the 1930s. According to testimony in a 1934 congressional hearing, 2,019 cities and other
governmental entities had defaulted on their debt at that time. Back then, the leading
advocates of a bankruptcy option for local government were progressives, especially those
whose cities were overwhelmed by debt. Â  In 1933, Detroit mayor and future Supreme Court
justice Frank Murphy assured Congress that bankruptcy would be â€œan orderly and legal
wayâ€� to assist â€œthe people of these great urban centers that are now simply
being crushed out of existence by taxes and by debts.â€�

Â

Little did he envision a day when Detroit itself might need bankruptcy

Â 

The New Deal Congress obliged by enacting the first municipal bankruptcy law shortly
thereafter.

Â 

As with much New Deal legislation, the early history of municipal bankruptcy law was rocky.
The Supreme Court struck down the original law in 1936, concluding that it would infringe on
state authority, even if the state vigorously welcomed the law. (One reason for rejecting
municipal bankruptcy, according to Justice James Clark McReynolds , whose opinion was and is
widely criticized but who was perhaps prescient, was that state bankruptcy might be next.)

Â

McReynolds saw the future, and didn’t like it

Â 

But two years later, after the famous â€œswitch in timeâ€� from its earlier pattern
of striking down New Deal legislation, the High Court gave its blessing to a 1937 version of the
law. Congressâ€™s revisions to the municipal bankruptcy legislation were slight, but
the Court was ready to uphold it. Because the law was â€œcarefully drawn so as not to
impinge upon the sovereignty of the State,â€� the Court concluded, and made sure that
the state â€œretains control of its fiscal affairs,â€� it now passed
constitutional muster.

Â 

Bankruptcy of states is thus Constitutionally possible â€“ but is it feasible and
politically possible?
