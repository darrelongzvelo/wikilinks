But I was like, `I don\'t want to coach. I hate doing camps.\' I went on, and I played, and then I retired after the Olympics in \'92, in December. So after the Olympics, I went another six months. I looked for other jobs and had some offers, and nothing was interesting to me. I think I just loved the sport so much that I wanted any way I could still be involved, and he kept his word, and I went to the University of Houston in January \'93. I was only there eight months, but that is definitely the reason I got into coaching, and now I can\'t imagine doing anything.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      From\n                      <a href="http://www.badensports.com/coach_profile.cfm?coach_id=45" shape="rect">Baden Sports.com: Women\'s Volleyball Coach Deitre Collins-Parker </a>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      Collins-Parker has plenty of international coaching experience as well.

Middle hitters or blockers are usually the tallest players on the team. Because of their proximity to the setter, the middle hitter usually receives most of the quick and lower height sets. Because of the variety of ability levels and heights, setting the middle is considered one of the most difficult sets to make in all of volleyball.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      However, setting the middle is indispensable to opening up the offense and keeping the opposing defenders on their toes. In practice, middles get yelled at a lot because they tend to get in the way of the setter. Some of the greatest middles in the history of the game include Deitre Collins (Hawaii),\n                      <a rel="wikipedia" title="Kim Oden" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Oden" class="zem_slink" shape="rect">Kim Oden</a>\n                      (Stanford),\n                      <a rel="wikipedia" title="Elaina Oden" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaina_Oden" class="zem_slink" shape="rect">Elaina Oden</a>\n                      (Pacific), and Danielle Scott (\n                      <a rel="homepage" title="California State University, Long Beach" href="http://www.csulb.edu/" class="zem_slink" shape="rect">Long Beach State</a>\n                      ).\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      From\n                      <a href="http://www.atlantaboom.org/" shape="rect">the Atlanta Boom Institute </a>\n                      :\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      Excellence in Coaching Education &amp; Leadership Skills\nAt the alumnae reception in San Antonio we celebrated Celia\'s birthday and Deitre Collins (Emory \'05) being named to the NCAA 25th Anniversary Volleyball team.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      From\n                      <a href="http://gostanford.cstv.com/sports/w-volley/spec-rel/011503aaa.html" shape="rect">Go Stanford.

Ivy League. The head coach of the defending Ivy League champion Cornell women\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s volleyball team, Collins is one of three players to win the Honda Award, given annually to the nation\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s best volleyball player, twice during her playing days (1983-84). The other two-time winners are UCLA\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Natalie Williams in 1991-92 and Stanford\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s\n                      <a rel="wikipedia" title="Logan Tom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Tom" class="zem_slink" shape="rect">Logan Tom</a>\n                      in 2001-02.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      But Collins holds another, less celebrated, distinction. She is one of the very few black women coaching in Division I-A.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      In January the Ivy League caught up with Collins to reminisce about her past successes, and to discuss what the future holds for black, female coaches and the double standard that exists between male and female coaches in collegiate athletics.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      From\n                      <a href="http://www.cstv.com/sports/w-volley/stories/092404aar.html" shape="rect">cstv.com</a>\n                      : \n10 Questions (and a Few Follow-ups) With Deitre Collins \nThe first-year Big Red volleyball coach talks about her experiences as a player and coach\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <strong>If you had to pick just one, what is the most memorable moment of your career as a player or a coach?</strong>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      You know what, that\'s easy for me. It was winning the Broderick Cup (given to the nation\'s best collegiate female athlete in all sports). That meant more to me than...anything. I mean, the Olympics are different. The Broderick Award was individual. I remember it plain as day, and I think because, in that particular year that I won, Jackie Joyner was in it, Tracy Caulkins.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      I remember at the ceremony, they were reading off all of these people\'s stats, and I\'m going, &quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; First of all, I can\'t believe I\'m here, representing volleyball, and then, Jackie was still in college, so she wasn\'t as well known as she became later, but we\'re just like, &quot;Tracy knows all the athletics directors by name, there\'s no way.&quot; Neither one of us prepared a speech. Lo and behold, they call my name, and I\'m just dumbfounded, and so I think that was the highlight of my career as a volleyball player.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      Jackie won it three years later. It\'s just been a lot of neat people that have won the Broderick (among them Cheryl Miller, Jackie Joyner, Mia Hamm, Rebecca Lobo and Misty May), so it\'s just a huge honor to me to be listed among those people. And then, the Opening Ceremonies at the Olympics is right there. But I just separate those into two different classes. That\'s a great experience (the Opening Ceremony) and that\'s the biggest honor (the Broderick Cup) for me.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      From\n                      <a href="http://uhathletics.hawaii.edu/pr.html?prid=13709&amp;p=12" shape="rect">UH Athletics</a>\n                      : \nShoji And Collins Named To NCAA 25th Anniversary Team\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <a href="http://www.theithacajournal.com/article/20081002/SPORTS/810020332" shape="rect">Cornell\'s volleyball coach </a>\n                      to enter Hall of Fame\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <script type="text/javascript">&lt;!-- google_ad_client = &quot;pub-1037250083466856&quot;; /* Voices300x250, created 9/18Mistyon DWTS */ google_ad_slot = &quot;7217962836&quot;; google_ad_width = 300; google_ad_height = 250; //--&gt; </script>\n                      <script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" type="text/javascript"> </script>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      INDIANAPOLIS - University of Hawai`i women\'s volleyball coach Dave Shoji and former All-American Deitre Collins have been named to the NCAA 25th Anniversary Women\'s Volleyball Team, celebrating the 25th year of the NCAA Tournament in women\'s volleyball.\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      <br clear="none"></br>\n                      Shoji was voted as the coach of the team.
