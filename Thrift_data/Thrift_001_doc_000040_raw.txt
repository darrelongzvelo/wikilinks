2016 Obama's America:  The Movie You MUST SEE!





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/7652424.jpg 08-27-2012   It has been decades since a
documentary appeared as a feature movie in theaters and actually made money-can't recall
another, unless one considers Michael Whatizname's propaganda films actual
documentaries.   2016 has had sales of $7 million or so as of this writing.  No wonder: Best
selling author Dinesh D'Souza and Hollywood Producer Gerald Molen pull together an analysis
of Beloved Leader's psyche, based on his own writings, speeches and the words of people who
knew him growing up.

You get to know his Communist mom and grandfather-who sought out a proper African American
Communist as a sort of radical Big Brother for young Barry Soetero.

You go with D'Souza to visit the hometown in Kenya where BHO's father was from, discover how
Barry's mom created in BHO's mind, an idealized  concept of his absentee father: they met
only once and Obama Senior was a mean drunk who died while driving drunk, and you journey to
Indonesia where BHO lived for so many years, Punahou High School (tuition starts at
$19,00/year) and learn why Obama hates America and is trying to destroy our country:  He sees
the USA as a kind of old Europe Colonial Power, stripping subjugated countries of their
material wealth and reselling it a sky high prices to the very people it was stolen from. 
Sound Marxist to you?  It is.  Go see the movie.  And be afraid.  Be VERY afraid!

Democrats & Obama Administration: 

Lefty Millionaires and Billionaires, Oh My!





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/251446.jpg?585 Links to Progressive Caucus Hard core
Communists and Socialists took control of the Democrat Party in 1991, when the CPUSA met in
CHICAGO, Illinois and decided that from that point on they would drop the C-word from their
vocabulary and run as Democrats.  Prior to that time, the Communists and Socialists ran
their own candidates like Gus Hall and Angela Davis.

Their strategy paid off with the election of Billenhill Clinton in '92.  They got the shock of
their scarlet lives when George "W" Bush staged an upset victory in the 2000 election, but
eventually regrouped.  They threw support initially behind Hillary Clinton for 2008, but
switched to the candidate with more lefty bona fides: then Freshman U.S. Sen. Barack Hussein
Obama.



SOOOOO, how many Commiecrats can YOU name?  (Answers at the bottom of the page.  NO PEEKING!

Extra Credit:  How many have an association with Chicago?  There are five or more.  Here's
a hint:  HC, BO, and???





" Be not intimidated ...nor suffer yourselves to be wheedled out of your liberties  by any
pretense of politeness, delicacy, or decency.  These, as they are often used, are but three
different names for hypocrisy, chicanery and cowardice."    John Adams, Founding
Father on what came to be called Political Correctness!



Holy Cow!  This Guy Pulls NO Punches:  He is critical of Islam and tears into a lot of other
issues.

05-29-2012  Don't waste time trying to Google this stuff because Big Goog has become a
politically correct part of the Lefty Master Plan.  (Here's a LINK)



The speaker is an Irish comic, Pat Condel l speaking on the subject of Islam from the
perspective of someone who lives in the U.K. where Lefty Politicians suck up to radicals
working to advance Islamic culture (e.g., released the Pan Am Bomber), the kind of thing would
have gotten the traitors an appointment with Her Majesty's Hangman only fifty years ago. 



Condell is an informed and agitated  witness to the destruction of Western Culture so it may
be replaced with  Sharia Law & Madrassas teaching hate to little kids .  He doesn't like the
situation, presents his facts clearly and includes examples to support his opinions.  What
he says is alarming and mostly true.  Too bad they don't have American style talk radio in the
U.K.



Condell delivers his non-politically correct observations at machine gun pace while
remaining easy to understand.  You could surf for days at this very good site   before
getting as much information as you'll get in 30 minutes listening to Mr. Condell's videos.
Have a listen to his opinions about the E.U., World Dictatorship, the spread of antisemitism,
holidays, world economic troubles, persecution of Christians, socialism & tribalism . 



One other thing:  Do you think all of this is simply made up, that Moslems have no goal of
spreading Islam through terrorism or gradual means?  G et the dope strait from the flying
camel's mouth .

So, Do YOU Think Obama Was Born In Kenya, Hawaii or "None of the Above"?





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/9824467.jpg?334 Kenyans are proud that their Native Son
became POTUS Americans know a good bit more about President Obama than they did about
candidate Obama in the run up to the 2008 election, but remain largely uninformed according to
polls and interviews. When people are asked about what is already on record as documented by
President Obama in his autobiography, they seem surprised and doubtful about facts told in
the Presidents own words.   http://www.youtube.com /watch?v=BWB6J9GXM24 In the book,
Obama brags about his poor grades and having sought out associations with Marxist groups,
Moslems, “ Chicanos” and practically every ethnic group except Jewish and Inuit
Peoples. Had there been any Lefty Inuits at Occidental college or Columbia, he would have
included them as well in order to broaden his appeal.

Mr. Obama bragged about heavy marijuana and cocaine use. Since most voters do not approve of
drug use, particularly hard drugs like cocaine, how could this information be overlooked
when it was published in his own words?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTMif8cGlcE&feature=related

Dreams of My Father was probably not written as an autobiography given the young age when it was
written. It was really an expression of solidarity with like minded individuals and a whole
spectrum of ethnic groups that Mr. Obama and his handlers like Bill Ayers (who ghost wrote much
of the book) felt would be useful as Mr. Obama sought higher office. The strategy paid off.
Hillary Clinton had been the leading contender for the Democratic Party nomination until the
Lefty core consolidated their support behind Barack Obama. The MSM (Marxist-Socialist
Media) circled the wagons around him as well, flooding newspaper & magazine pages and the
airwaves with stories supportive of Mr. Obama and excluded stories critical of him,
especially sensitive content in his “autobiography.” Obama picked up momentum which
overwhelmed the Clinton campaign. Following some behind the scenes negotiations, Hillary
went quietly into the night and Obama went on to win the nomination. Since 2008, the MSM have
been unwavering and obvious in their support for President Obama. Those individuals
providing unflattering information have been viciously attacked in the media as being
motivated by racism or paranoia, leading to a form of censorship.

By censoring our very words , our language, citizens become less  able to speak out about
issues of real concern. Retied Army Col. Alan West, a Republican Congressman and an African
American was disinvited to the NAACP Convention because he called out 50+ members of Congress
as Communists--the Progressive Caucus includes documented CPUSA (Communist Party USA)
members and many members of Congress are “fellow-travelers.”
http://keywiki.org/index.php/Progressive_Caucus It has become dangerous to seek
information relating to the President's place of birth, Social Security number, College
Transcripts, Draft Card or Financial Aid application. The Obama Administration has
stonewalled official investigations and Freedom of Information Act requests. Persons
daring to push the issue have been investigated by the FBI and “exposed” in the press for
every personal flaw, even as the press ignores the President's own issues.

So, Does This RN think that the President was born in Kenya, or Hawaii? The short answer is that
the facts surrounding his birth do not add up and having a Rino Republican Governor declare
that she saw his birth certificate and that it is authentic, is countered by tons of contrary
evidence , including statements by his own family that they were present for his birth at Coast
Province General Hospital, in Africa.

Here is a pretty good summary, including links to information which counters his claim of
being born in Hawaii. Judge for yourself:

Kenyan Ambassador indicated that Obama was born in Kenya:

Radio Host: “One more quick question, President-Elect Obama’s birthplace over in Kenya
is that going to be a national spot to go visit where he was born?”

Kenyan Ambassador: “It is already an attraction. His paternal grandmother is still
alive.”

Radio Host: “But his birth place, they will put up a marker there?”

Kenyan Ambassador: “It will depend on the government. It is already well known.”

Are you ready to accept creeping Sharia Law in the USA?

HALAL NO!!





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/6416132.jpeg?317 Take note of the Propaganda
buzz-words. 05-09-2012      Don't call it a Jy-roe.   It's pronounced ghee-ro. 
Gyro is the most familiar Middle Eastern food for most Americans and our local Gyro Shop, which
is owned by a Moslem family, sells a variety of Middle Eastern foodstuffs ready to eat and also
available to purchase as grocery items.  Their Gyros are GREAT: stuffed full of the lamb
based meat, sliced from the Kronos machine.  

 Nobody forces This RN to go there and no other restaurants are forced to provide Halal foods
.  At least not yet...In our community, there are two or three Halal Grocery Stores, plus an
assortment of Spanish, Southeast Asian, Caribbean, Indian restaurants and grocery
stores. 

Want to try something from one of those cultures?  No problem.  Go buy whatever you
want--the proprietors will be flattered if you ask for their recommendations and will
remember you next time you come in.  Nobody is forcing you to eat ethnic foods, but that may
soon change if Radical Islamic Groups in the U.S. get their way--and they are already getting
their way.

The Islamofascists and their Lefty Attorney allies are doing their best to gradually force
grocery stores, restaurants, school, workplace, military and prison cafeterias to provide
Halal foods, but first they plan to make Halal foods a little bit acceptable and familiar to us,
so that we do not notice the change when it is mandated . 

One company hopes to hook up with profit via an advertising campaign to make Sharia-mandated
Halal foods as familia r as the Taco and trendy as whatever the Occupy People like to eat (Shame
on you!) and  "nice" by linking Halal foods with propaganda words:   wholesome, pure,
sustainable, fair trade, just practices, environment, animal welfare.

That's because Halal foods wouldn't seem so appetizing if linked to what recent history has
seen associated with Islam:  Beheadings , jihad, terrorism, bombing, flogging,
kidnapping, murder, buggery , pederasty/pedophilia, female genital mutilation ,
polygamy, h onor-killings , slavery and The Bomb .  WARNING:  links may be graphic.

Get ready for Halal foods and Sharia Law.  Sharia is what is coming to America, courtesy of
CAIR,   The Anti-American  ACLU and Obama Administration and the Commiecrats .  Halal
foods is just a part of the bigger plan.  In their own words:

“Islam isn’t in America to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran
should be the highest authority in America, and Islam the only accepted religion on Earth.”

- Omar Ahmad, Chairman and co-founder of CAIR

Halal No!

Remains Thought To Be Occupy Gary Protesters

(Well, It Could Be True Department)





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/6398100.jpg?318 Police Artist's rendering of how men
looked when alive. 01-21-2012  The bodies of two white men found near the Jackson Five
Theater In Gary, Indiana have not been identified according to official sources.   In a  
Monday briefing,  Gary, Indiana Police Department Spokesperson Melvin Sergent released
an artist's recreation of what the men might have looked like.



Lake County Coroner Dr. Melvin Turner estimated the bodies had lain undiscovered, except by
rodents, four or five weeks. "That corresponds to the first snowstorm of the season," he said.
  Dressed only in t-shirts and jeans, the pair were not equipped to survive on their own and
probably wandered into the abandoned downtown area and froze to death while looking for a
homeless shelter. 



Police believe the men became separated from a group of seven or eight pierced and tattooed
Occupy protesters that had been in the Rustbelt city  to carry signs blaming Gary's decline
on Corporate Greed.  They may have missed the DNC bus to the Protest Feeding Station at the
ACORN Center for Human Potential in Chicago, just thirty minutes away.



The Bus Company released this statement relating to the missing Occupy Protesters: 

"It wasn't our driver's fault.  You got to feed and take care of those protest people; most of
them ain't got the sense to come in out of the rain ."



Gary, across the State Line from Chicago, was once a thriving steel town of over 200,000
people.  It fell victim to successive Democrat Mayors and Municipal Unions, a process of
decline that began during the Jimmy Carter Administration.  Gary, Indiana has been called
America's Biggest Ghost Town.  







September 21st, 2011



President Obama addresses the United Nations General Assembly - the First Lady also attends.

Coincidentally on this date in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party announced that they were in
control of China and were establishing a Marxist government. 



Happy Birthday, Elia Kazan





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/3091393.jpeg?300 Elia Kazan, American and Nikolai
Nolte Elia Kazan (Kazanjoglous) was an award winning Hollywood Director who directed many
important films of the 1940s and 1950s, such as On The Waterfront, Viva Zapata and the list goes
on.  He was born in Istanbul, Turkey of Greek ancestry in 1909, had been a communist, then
turned fervent anticommunist and testified before Congress, eventually naming others who
were involved with the Communist Party in the U.S. during the Cold War.

His testimony led to the "blacklisting" of some Hollywood leftists, and led to the decline of
Mr. Kazan's career in Hollywood when left leaning actors refused to work with him. 

Kazan did what he felt he had to do as a loyal American and the blacklisting of Elia Kazan lasted
until the 1991 Oscars,  when he won a Life Achievement Oscar for the great body of work he had
directed.  This R.N. has never been much of a celebrity watcher, but was watching the night
Kazan, then elderly and frail, made his way to the podium to accept his long-delayed award. The
camera panned to a scowling row of Hollywood leftists, including actor Nick Nolte , who turned
away, snarling against the man they saw as a traitor to Marxism.   

Nolte and the other Hollywood Lefties never looked so red as they did on that night; by
contrast, the dignified and grateful Kazan looked like a gentleman-hero.  R.I.P.



"I hate the Communists and have for many years and don't feel right about giving up my career to
defend them. I will give up my film career if it is in the interests of defending something I
believe in, but not this. "--Elia Kazan







WE NEED TORT REFORM





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/9961539.jpg?324 08-21-2011    It had to happen
sooner or later.  On Friday this RN had finished lunch at the local Chinese all-you-can-eat
buffet.  The slender young Asian woman brought the bill on a little faux-enameled plastic
tray with the usual cellophane wrapped fortune cookie.  Fortune cookies for years have
contained silly little sayings and philosophy, and more lately a word or phrase of Chinese. 
This RN opened the cookie and instead of the Chinese word, it said:  "DO NOT EAT FORTUNE." 

It  is inconceivable that anyone could be harmed by eating a 1/2 inch by 2 inch slip of
paper--well, they COULD suffer a disabling paper cut, but really; must the potential for a
frivolous lawsuit even invade a fortune cookie?  The Big Tort Law industry is like a tax on
everything, raising costs to benefit the Tort Law Industry, while becoming a type of lottery
for the few drawn in by the slick T.V. ads.  WE NEED TORT REFORM in the United States. 
Unfortunately, the Social Democrats are in the pocket of Big Tort and will block any attempt at
tort reform.  Not that tort reform cannot happen.  Several states have instituted tort
reform incrementally , but doing so requires the election of Republicans, especially
conservatives with backgrounds in private business, instead of attorneys, since private
businesspeople understand the burden that Big Tort places upon us all.





I am certain nothing has done so much to destroy the juridical safeguards of individual
freedom as the striving after the mirage of social justice.            F.A.

Rupert Murdoch's U.K. Troubles Exploited By The Left

Media Matters promotes rumors & calls for investigations on both sides of the Atlantic



Have you wondered why a snooping scandal over the British tabloid, News of The World, like our
National Enquirer,  has been so much in the news over here?  It's because of Media Matters,
the Lefty, tax exempt 401-3c nonprofit that is out to get FOX News.   Rupert Murdoch owns FOX
News so the supposed FBI investigation, nonstop coverage on the Big Three Networks,
newspapers and Lefty Websites has a goal:  Shut down FOX News.  It's all about FOX News, as
Media Matters admits on their website:   " Why should we (care)?  Simple : Murdoch's media
empire includes Fox News."



U.K. Lefties forced Murdoch to shut down his tabloid, News of The World and they smell blood--
the snooping scandal in the U.K. could be a convenient opportunity to damage FOX News, if not
shut it down like Hugo Chavez shut down news outlets that he didn't like in neocommunist
Venezuela.  That is Lefty style Censorship, the First Amendment be damned and we are being
pushed by the left onto a very slippery slope.   What's next at Media Matters?  Book burning ?



B.O. Walks Out of Debt Limit Negotiations





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/1786811.jpg?403 Barack Obama still insists that tax &
spend is just fine during a recession.  When the country is broke.  While every man, woman
and child in the country owes $48,000 as their share of the Federal Debt.

And after telling Congress yesterday that it was time to get down to business and "eat your
peas," he today dramatically walked out of negotiations  being held over debt limit
extension. 

Apparently the Republicans aren't being snowed by his tax and spend today, cut later
deviousness.  No wonder he walked out.

"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen."







Coming to America:  Squat Toilets & Agenda 21





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/9563378.jpeg?708 Anyone who has traveled to a third
world country has really, really missed two things:  Flush toilets and Toilet Paper.  The
United Nations and the G R EE N radicals have a plan to use control of water resources around the
world to take away your "throne".  



The flush toilet is believed to have been invented by an Englishman in the 19th Century and is
considered a great advance in sanitation.  Now they have come under fire by the G ree n crowd
because toilets use water resources, which are scarce in some countries. 



This makes the flush toilet a great propaganda tool for the left, and they have subtly used the
subject as a way of controlling Americans ' use of water through various Federal, State and
Water Bureaucracies .  



Plumbing Code regulations were Federalized almost 20 years ago, making 1.8 gallons/flush
toilets mandatory for new construction in the United States.   Prior to the new regulations,
most toilets used 3 gallons per flush (and disposed of the "waste" with a single flush). 



Squat toilets use much less water, since they do not flush and are only slightly better than an
old fashioned outhouse or "privy." Their mandatory use by Americans is a Lefty goal in order to
settle old scores and give the U.S.A. what they see as our comuppence for liberty and
capitalism.  They are promoting these by touting their "health benefits."  Yeah, right.
  Agenda 21 Must Be Stopped.

06-26-2011   The Black Robe Regiment is a newish site that addresses the religious
underpinnings of our Revolution, Constitution and the Founding Fathers--all well
documented.   The site makes a great case for Politics From The Pulpit, which the Lefties are
dead set against, unless they are talking about Rev. Jeremiah Wright, or the Westboro
Fauxbaptist Church.   The site has good resource links for modern day clergy.

Glenn Beck TV --Yes, Mr. Beck has a new gig all lined up, even as his show on FOX ends.  Glenn has
brought a lot of information to the fore concerning George Soros' machinations, Obama
Administration Radicals , the Marxist Socialist Media, our Constitution and history on his
FOX show, and his books are pretty good reads, too.  Note to Lefty Readers: Beck is a Mormon and
has made a lot of money. So is and has Sen. Harry Reid.



"Till people find themselves greatly abused and oppressed by their governors, they are not
apt to complain; and whenever they do, in fact, find themselves thus abused and oppressed,
they must be stupid not to complain. "

NHS in Scotland:  House of The Rising Sun??





Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/8352574.jpg?294 Lefty barriers to change in the U.K.
6-23-2011 They struggle mightily over financing the National Health Service in the U.K. 
Their newspapers are filled with NHS Horror Stories , like "Woman Gives Birth On Pile of Filthy
Sheets on Floor of NHS Hospital."  And of course, they have become so accustomed to the sad
state of affairs that they raise Cain whenever "The Government" tries anything new. 



Click on the photo at left for an amusing Rap, done by some Scots to the tune of "House of The
Rising Sun"  from the Grumpy RN blog.  (Sure he's grumpy-their Socialist system
stinks).  It's a protest against NHS cutbacks and of course, they use the narrative of the
left:   Class envy, greed, etc. etc.  At least that's what this RN thinks they are saying ...
judge for yourself.







A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul .

Motorcyclists Visit Westboro Baptist Church on Sunday



Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/5360180.jpg?285 Grave at Arlington Natl. Cemetary
06-10-2011  A group of motorcyclists showed up for Sunday Services at Westboro Baptist
Church. Guess what? They weren't actually having services at their "church."  The Westboro
people are the nitwits that disrupt military funerals by shouting at mourners and display
signs that seem to be critical of the USA related to gay people being more-or-less accepted. 

Their Fauxbaptist Church always seemed bogus to this RN--more like a pack of Code Pinkos out
for a lefty peacenick-atheist "twofer."  The fact that nobody from their coven showed up for
Sunday services is evidence that WBC is not a legitimate place of worship.  Perhaps the Obama
Administration will revoke their tax exempt status.

U.S.P.S. Spreads The G ree n Revolution



Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/4046010.jpg Go green--or red? 06-08-2011  The
money-losing USPS is promoting the so-called Green cause via a set of "green" stamps, posters
inside USPS facilities and on some of their vehicles.  Whoops, that's OUR vehicles, meaning
the USPS is spreading green propaganda at taxpayer expense. 



Perhaps the folks at the USPS could spend their working hours thinking of new ways to save money
instead of promoting lefty causes. You know, the USPS was started in the 18th century when
there wasn't Email, UPS or FedEx .  They didn't have good roads then, either.  Perhaps it's
time to eliminate the USPS and save Billion$ in taxpayer subsidies.  But the Unions probably
wouldn't stand for it, since the NALC is fighting against cutting Saturday delivery.





What's Next-An Implanted Chip?



Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/4727828.jpg?185 06-06-2011   Experts have been
working on a "Unique Patient Identifier" that will link a patient's biometric
identification with his or her EHR (Electronic Health Record).  Actually, getting
"chipped" like a pet will not be necessary, as biometric I.D. technology, such as rapid
fingerprint readers and eye scans are already here. 

The only steps left are to assign unique numbers to individuals, like a SS Number and to
implement the system nationwide. Feeling creepy yet?   Western Health Information Networ k
is using an    (Uh-oh!)  " Voluntary Universal Healthcare Identifier "  and the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation has been involved in Unique Patient Identifier projects.  P.R. for
the concept has claimed that a compulsory system in  use c-o-u-l-d save as much as $77
billion.  HERE is a link to Clinfowiki for definitions of various medical information
related terms.







Islamofascist Urges U.S. Moslems: Kill Americans

06-05-2011   American traitor turned Al Queda spokesman  Adam Gadahn has released this
video urging American Moslems to do their duty to Islam: Buy guns to kill Americans. 
Parroting  the lies of the lefty Gun Banners, Azzam al-Amriki  as he is now known, relates
that anyone can buy fully automatic weapons at gun shows w/o restrictions or I.D.  Perhaps he
believes everything he reads on the anti-gun sites or is simply spreading antigun
propaganda.  This video will surely increase the sales of guns & ammo to REAL Americans
--just in case we have to fight people like him .



Federal Employees Waste Millions of Work Time on Union Activities:



Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/8130500.jpg?184 Who works for WHOM?? 06-03-2011
Federal law allows SOME official Union activity, such as participation in Collective
Bargaining, but under the Obama Administration the interperetation of what is allowable
Union Activity during work time has expanded so that the cost of such activity has increased 
by $millions, turning Federal employees into defacto Union employees at taxpayer expense.
 

Georgia  Republican  Congressman Phil Gingrey, has introduced legislation intended to
dial back allowable union activity. The Obama administration and the unions are sure to fight
the new law as they as they have fought plans to reduce USPS service to five days per week.   That
is the tail wagging the dog.









Chemicals Linked to Spontaneous Abortions??

05-31-2011 -- Some scientists have discovered a possible link between exposure to
agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides and hormones with spontaneous abortions in
human s .  The link is tenuous; exposure can be direct, as when a pregnant employee of a farm or
agribusiness comes in contact with the substances, and when people consume the
substances. 

It would be nice to know if farm animals were similarly affected, since there are so many farm
animals, they are raised under controlled conditions and pregnancies are well documented by
the farmers themselves.  There have been some rather bogu studies that supposedly linked
all kinds of things to human maladies. If only we knew if the study was performed by reputable
scientists free of any political bias.  Now that would make a great study; comparing the same
data collected by lefty vs nonlefty researchers.  How much would the reader like to bet on the
outcome of that study?



Of Dogs And Tyranny



Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/8269118.jpg Paternalism vs Liberty 05-20-2011 
Several years ago, the daughter of this RN applied to be in the School Safety Patrol, that is to
be one of the day glow orange belt wearing kids that tell other kids when to cross the street. 
What does that have to do with tyranny?  Consider her story and draw your own conclusions:
There were several kids interested and qualified academically for the job and they met with
the Principal and School Resource Officer, who is a real cop assigned to  schools these days
.  Each child was asked why they should be in the Safety Patrol.  Most answered that they
wanted to serve the other students, prevent accidents, that sort of thing, but one child was
different from the others.  He said, "It'll be kind of cool to tell the other kids what to do."

That story, and a review of a new biography of Otto Von Bismark, the 19th Century Prime Minister
of Prussia and Germany got this RN thinking.  Just what makes someone a tyrant?  Is it nature
or nurture?  Do some people just crave power over others from a young age?    One has to
wonder if the lad got to enjoy power over others in Fifth Grade and if he is now a Political
Science major planning a career in Progressive/Democratic Party politics. 



That some people crave power over others is evident.  Everyone knows someone with a spouse or
s.o. who raises Caine if they cannot get their way in relationships, who must be in control of
every element of his/her life and family relationships.  When this RN was growing up, there
was a male neighbor that  often drive his car past our home.  My sisters and I were not even
aware that the man had a spouse until I saw him with a hollow-eyed woman in the grocery store one
day. Instead of going shopping as other women did, the poor woman showed her husband each item
from the shelf, as if to ask his permission to buy the item.  I watched them for several
minutes, pondering this odd interaction before moving on.  Later, when we were at home
unpacking groceries from the paper bags (it was back in the day) my mother said that the woman
was Mr. Y's wife, that he wouldn't let her leave the house alone and it was rumored that he beat
her regularly.



This RN has some familiarity with a cult, Word of Faith Fellowship "Church" o f North Carolina
that is headed by a woman who lives in a large home while cult members apparently live in
dormitories, segregated by age et gender.  One person's cult is another's religion and it is
not the purpose here to point a finger but that cult and others like it are all about control over
others.  Mind control if not physical control for the pleasure of having power over
others.  And of course, profit.   So what does this have to do with Von Bismark, George Soros
and President Obama? Von Bismark held power in Europe during the last half of the 19th Century,
was an early "Progressive" who initiated a national health plan, united Prussia and Germany
into a Greater Deutchland and influenced the political theories and ambitions of others,
including Karl Marx and Adolf Hitler.  Progressives like to portray the Von Bismark as a
forward thinking diplomat.



Bismark famously called politics the "art of the possible" and was known as a political tough
customer who bent the rules and persecuted those opposed to him.  In short, he engaged in
tyranny, but had another side that illustrates something about the psych of some tyrants: 
They may have paternalistic leanings which may be taken to extreme in how they deal with fellow
human beings.  In one account, Bismark grieved over the death of his dog, his grief all the
more pronounced because he had struck the dog over some canine transgression just prior to the
dog's death.



Bismark had an evident paternalistic attitude toward the people he ruled which led to a lot of
anger issues relating to those who couldn't, or wouldn't appreciate his good intentions. 
The demise of Von Bismark's dog  illustrates  how paternalism, even when
well-intentioned can lead to tyranny.   Tyranny is never good for those subject to it. 
Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Kim Il Sung, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, various S. American juntas,
African despots, the list goes on and on.  The despots live well as "their" peo ple starve or
are simply killed. Millions of lives have been erased because they didn't fit in with or
appreciate their country's' W.L.-Wonderful Leader(s). The U.S. Constitution, which was
designed to place limits on Government in order to avoid tyranny, is under attack by so-called
Progressives who's cult-like ideology are based on European Socialism of Von Bismark and
Karl Marx.  For many years, Progressives and their Marxist allies have chipped away at our
individual rights and national sovereignty so that today, our national well being is at
risk.  People like George Soros and have the power to use propaganda and billion$ to bring
down nations in order to install a form of government that is antithetical to the kind of nation
our Founders risked their lives to establish. This RN is opposed to the Obama
Administration's use of so many Czars, operating outside of the Constitution, their
inclusion of admitted Communists, and alliance with Mr. Soros and his organizations , no
matter how well intentioned they may or may not be.   



That ObamaCare is patterned after similar plans in Europe is a given.  What seems tyrannical
is the way that people are  to be punished with fees , which are actual fines for failing to buy
into The Plan.     What ingrates we are for failing to appreciate their beneficence! 





Who Is This Hairy Guy?



Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/1274179.jpg?244 Harry Guy, RN ??? 05-18-2011  From an
ad seen on Facebook.  Have you seen this advertisement elsewhere?  The link goes to a
company hawking Masters' Degrees and federal financial aid packages.  There has been an
explosion of private schools of Nursing the past few years r/t the perception that Nursing is
"where it's at" financially, and because Big Government financed University Schools of
Nursing seem inadequate to meet the need for new grads.

One can't help but wonder what the value of a MSN from a school advertising with an outfit
featuring the Hairy Guy, and why Universities cannot meet the demand for RNs (and LPNs, too)
after so many financial aid initiatives, new Nursing programs, etc.  Perhaps the whole
system of Health Care is inflated like a big Housing Bubble, poised to collapse under
ObamaCare.









Exit The Donald--Saw That Coming 

05-16-2011

So, "The Donald", AKA Donald Trump has announced he is dropping out of the Republican primary
race for the Presidency.  No surprise there, Mr. Trump is much talk, little substance.  And
he has advocated for some liberal measures in the past, such as the taking of private property
using Eminent Domain, in order to build some of his major properties.  Such a thing is
disturbing to ordinary Americans. 

The TV and newspapers are asking, "If not him, then who?  They're speculating on Mitt Romney
and severral others, including another flawed candidate, Newt Gingrich.  Mr. Gingrich is a
former GA Congressman and Speaker of The House of Representatives.  With baggage,
nonpolitical and noncriminal, but the personal kind--he has been divorced twice under
rather tawdry circumstances.

America needs a Republican who is a true conservative, but at least for now, none are ready or
willing to run.  Gov. Cristie of New Jersey would be a good candidate, but said no.  S

o would Jeb Bush, but the Democrats and their media allies would call that a "Bush
Dynasty"--sort of like a Kennedy Dynasty, only b-a-a-a-a-a-a-d! 

There are others, but so far, no obvious takers, except one.

Herman Cain.  The man can communicate conservatism like no one since Ronald Reagan.  He has
real business experience and a clean personal life ( from what we know of him ).  Listen to his
words HERE .

Nice Guy Drops Out

05-14-2011

Got this email from former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee .  Gov. H announced last evening
that he would not make another run for the Presidency.  Too bad.  He is a retired Methodist
Pastor who has a respectful style that seems refreshing, especially when compared to the
typical smart-assed attitude of many lefties--an approach to political discourse strait
from "Rules For Radicals."



Back to Gov. Huckabee's email:

"The President said the southern border fence is virtually complete. Yet, according to the
Department of Homeland Security, just 5% of the 700-mile approved fence along the southern
border has been completed...The President mocked the idea of totally securing our borders
when he said his critics won't be satisfied until there's a moat built, filled with alligators
protecting our borders. I can't help but think the people of Arizona wouldn’t find that joke
very funny; after all, federal authorities are more intent on fighting the state for trying to
secure its’ own borders rather than enforcing the existing federal immigration laws .  So
I have to wonder - does the President really think making a partisan speech on immigration and
mocking those who don't agree with him is the way to work together?  Let’s once and for all
completely secure our borders, and then, we can have a discussion on true immigration reform
."

Well said, Governor.     Catch his program on FOX, if you can .



Scwarzeneger Divorce r/t "Love Child" Scandal/Conspiracy.  Can't make this stuff up!



Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/5893066.jpg Not what you think 05-10-2011

The LA Times has reported that Mr. & Mrs. Arnold Schwarzenegger have announced a separation
and are soon to divorce.  The Times story claimed that the couple's relationship had been
on the rocks for several years and (by extension-ed.) they stayed together for political
reasons, choosing to divorce after Der Governator left office.  It is said that Maria
Shriver, daughter of JFK sister Eunice Kennedy and Sergeant Shriver has been hinting about
an undefined life transition in her blog.   Ms. Shriver had been sought as a possible post
mortem replacement for her Uncle Edward "Ted" Kennedy, (as had Caroline Kennedy) but the
so-called Kennedy Seat went to Rino Republican (but Republican none the less)Scott Brown.  

Look for Maria Kennedy Shriver as a replacement for V.P. Joeseph Biden in 2012 .

Ban Latex Gloves?

According to the advocacy group Public Citizen, medical gloves that are made of natural
rubber latex or have cornstarch powder are harmful for hospital workers and patients and
should be banned from healthcare settings. 

>>What business is that of Public Citizen? Maybe a conservative group should start harassing
them for being a bunch of buttinskis.

>>>We have already switched to the cheap plastic gloves that tear where I work because of the
increase in latex allergies.  Nitrile and Neoprene are available at much higher cost.  See
how Progressive buttinskis cause medical costs to rise?  The neoprene ones are nice, but
feel thick & you need two assistants plus a team of horses to pull them on.  The nitrile ones are
a good compromise but will just increase the cost of doing business for facilities..



Illegal Strike?

Nursing groups at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, Maine, St. Vincent's Hospital in
Worcester, Mass., and Tufts Medical Center in Boston announced yesterday they're each
planning a single-day strike.

>>Isn't it against Federal Labor Laws to coordinate strikes across multiple employers?

Medicaid Pays for HALF of All Births?!

Medicaid pays the bills for more than half of Florida Births, and bills about to pass the
Legislature will change the rules for them. Some obstetricians are concerned.

>>Really? Almost none of them accept Medicaid anymore because it pays less than their cost
of  doing business, thanks to the Tort Lawyers (Sorry GK!) , Big Government Regulations and
above all, counterproductive Big Government spending on Health Care.  

>>>And Medicaid pays for more than half of all births in Florida?  It's the same in several
other states.  Who can argue that traditional family values, where Mom & Dad are married and
pay their own bills, is the way to go?



The Florida House is set to vote Wednesday on bills that include forcing women seeking an
abortion to have an ultrasound, prohibit public funding of abortions and tighten parental
notifications for teens trying to terminate a pregnancy.

>>Sounds like a pretty good compromise on the abortion issue.  Of course, the story source is
using demagoguery on the  issue.  

>>>And if my child was to have an AB w/o my consent, I would be incensed.  Allowing kids to have
medical procedure w/o parental knowledge and consent is just plain wrong.



New York City!?

Ever hear of the Taxi of Tomorrow ?  This comes strait out of Mayor Bloomberg's New York City
and may be awarded to Nissan, even though that company does business with Iran, probably the
biggest threat to world peace there is.  The T.O.T. is a Progressive boondoggle, like the
High Speed Bullet Trains that are all the Progressive Rage these days. 

The Taxi of Tomorrow campaign is a competition designed to select New York City's exclusive
taxi cab for a decade . In January, United Against a Nuclear Iran (UANI) called on New York City
to refuse to award the contract to companies that conduct business in Iran. 

>> Mayor Bloomberg, a Lefty Progressive, appears determined to award the contract to Nissan
in spite of Iran's regional nuclear hegemony and the controversy over the World Trade Center
area Victory Mosque.

>>>Where does he get off even having a universal taxi?  Is a Billionaire Mayor qualified to
design automobiles?  Where does he think he lives?  Disney Land?

>>>>And what about Iran's nuclear program?  Mayor B must think that the first nuke will go off
in Tel Aviv and NYC will be somehow safe.  E arth to Mayor Bloomberg:    The second Iranian
Nuke will go off in NYC in spite of your Iranian Gluteus-Kissing. 

>>> Thinking of visiting the Big Apple? Schedule your NYC vacation soon.   Why not let this
limosine-liberal know about it if you think he is wrong about Iran and the Taxi of 
Tomorrow: 

Michael Bloomberg, Mayor

04-28-2011

An article on a two-year Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (notthemagain!) initiative to
assess and transform nursing appeared in the Atlanta Journal Constitution. "The report
states that because nurses comprise the largest segment of the health care work force and
they’re are on the front lines of patient care, they should play a vital role in transforming
the nation’s health care system."    The article  quotes Linda McCauley , Dean and
professor at the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing at Emory University:  "What's
different this time is the timing." 

>>>Interesting timing. Just in time for ObamaCare.   And, sooooo nice of them to provide free
"education" for us.  They used to call that sort of thing propaganda.



04-30-2011

This is a site all about Politics, Healthcare, Economics and other factors equating to
Conservatism and Nursing.  I never planned a humor page, but will add one effective today
because of a new video sent me by Donna Baver Rovito. I don't often actually L.O.L. over links
people send me , but this video   did it.  It helps if you had Economics in school, so I will link
to an on line encyclopedia (not Wikipedia) to John Maynard Keynes and F. A. Hayek F.Y.I.  Are
you troubled by stress incontinence?  If so, better make a "pit stop" before you watch the
video!   



Osama Bin Laden Killed



Image: /uploads/2/8/7/6/2876442/5076151.jpg BHO as TR, Rough Rider 05-02-2011

The President went on TV to overclaim credit for sending a US Navy SEAL Team into Pakistan to
kill OBL.  That's both good news and politics. 



>>>A Republican POTUS would likely have claimed credit as well and as it turns out, the
information leading to the location of OBL came from intelligence developed during the Bush
Administration.



To his credit, Barack Hussein Obama has continued, even intensified Predator Drone strikes
on Al Qaeda in Pakistan in spite of predictable protests from the Pakistanis and his Moslem
background--his newly released Birth Certificate recorded his religion as Moslem & he grew
up in a Moslem country .



>>>> Besides the obvious timing, what took away from the occasion of OBLs death was how his body
was handled after the fact:   a 45 minute Moslem ceremony where the body was washed, Koranic
verses spoken and the weighted body lowered respectfully over the side.  What?  No
TAPS???  Leftists believe in peace through appeasement as demonstrated by the funeral held
aboard the USS Carl Vincent.      



Bin Laden was not regarded as an honorable foe, defeated on the battlefield like the Red Baron
of the First World War .  He was a stinking, heartless & filthy terrorist.  It would have
meant more to Americans had a couple of Sailors simply thrown him overboard and skipped the
Special Handling, which will mean nothing to the Radical World of Islam.

Article Claims Cost of Environmental Illness in Kids Is $76 Billion--But Is It Really?

05-08-2011

In an article cited by Health Affairs and transmitted across the country via Internet
newsletters & releases to media outlets and newspapers, authors Leonardo Trasande &
Yinghua Liu made some claims that are at best "junk science" and by all evidence propaganda to
support various radical environmental initiatives.

In their article, they claim a costly environmental link to numerous problems in children:
cancer, asthma, intellectual disability , autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder.



The link between environmental polutants,  some cancers and asthma is generally
accepted as true.  However, scientists disagree over a link between toxic substances and
the last three diagnoses.  The figures they cite are incredible.  $76 Billion when there
were just 26 million children (under 18y.o.) in 2008.  That would be around $3000 per child if
and only if, every child in the U.S. were sickened by environmental polutants.  However,
only a small percentage of children are sick. 



The authors recommend a solution which will have ongoing and staggering costs, perhaps far
beyond $76 billion:

"... institute premarket testing of (all) new chemicals; conduct toxicity testing on
(all) chemicals already in use; reduce lead-based paint hazards; and curb mercury emissions
from coal-fired power plants.



Lead paint was banned decades ago, and regulations covering all fifty states governs the
remediation of lead paint in existing buildings.  And what about the mercury containing
environment friendly light bulbs?  Why does the Government encourage their use if Hg is so
toxic--which it certainly is in some forms?  And, didn't President Obama state he plans to
shut down coal fired power plants and put the Coal Industry out of business?   How much will
that cost?



And what of Health Affairs as a claimed "Peer Reiewed" Journal?  A casual visit to the H.A.
website makes one thing clear--that the on line magazine is politically oriented, not a real
scientific journal.  Articles generally support liberal causes and goals. 



Health Affairs is published by a nonprofit dot-org and they report extensively on related
grants and initiatives out of George Soros groups such as the Open Society Institute. 



One has to wonder if all of the so-called peers reviewing articles are lefties.  In their own
words:    "Health Affairs is the leading journal of health policy thought and research. The
peer-reviewed journal was founded in 1981 (under a nonprofit) international health
education organization...explores health policy issues of current concern in both
domestic and international spheres."  



Considering the nature of Health Affairs, and the  staggering costs, based on speculative
data of the authors' remedies, it is hard to give the article much credibility, yet the article
has been widely disseminated.  This  smacks of propaganda rahter than science.  What's
next, policy making based on articles in Mother Jones ?
